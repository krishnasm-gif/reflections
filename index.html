<p class=MsoNormal>May you continue to examine your relationship with GOD and
see how you might be more aligned with GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people seem to have no sense of direction.  They want
to get somewhere, even some place they have been before, but they have no idea
of how to get there.  Other individuals have an internal GPS that lets them
know where they are and how to get where they want to go.  I can remember many
times, even in heavy forested mountains, that I have figured, the shortest
and/or easiest course to get me where I wanted to go.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, sometimes I am not as on-track with my relationship
with GOD.  I end up being off-course.  It is not that I am totally lost, I just
need to make some correction to my orientation so I can once again be more
fully aligned with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of being on track with GOD is reaching out in love to
others.  We will not make it to our ultimate destination if we forget to
express our loving appreciation to others who have made our journey a little
more smooth, pleasing, and enjoyable.  Take time to tell those special people
in your life that you value the love and support they have given you on your
path of faith.  I want to thank all those who have touched my life and made me
more aware of how much they care for me, all a sign of how much GOD loves me. 
I pray every day for those who have touched my life and helped me to be the
person GOD is calling me to be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seven Founders of Servite Order:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 4: 1-15, 25;       Psalm 50: 1 and 8,
16bc-17, 20-21;        Mark 8: 11-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Our readings begin with the story of Cain killing his
younger brother Abel.  The psalm picks up the theme of sibling being against
sibling and GOD’s displeasure with such attitudes and actions.  In the Gospel,
Jesus challenges the religious leaders who seek a sign from Him (not for the
purpose of believing in Him, but to use as evidence against Him).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The story of our human ancestors continues.  From the
sin of disobedience, the human condition worsens to fratricide (killing of a
brother).  Cain is upset because his sacrifice of grain is not as pleasing to
the LORD as his younger brother’s offering of the best of his flock.  Some
people believe that GOD’s displeasure with Cain’s sacrifice was based on Cain’s
not offering the best of what he had.  Others see Cain’s attitude toward GOD as
the reason GOD did not look as favorably on his gift as opposed to how GOD
looked at the gift and attitude of Abel.  Cain is inflamed with jealousy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Rather than try to correct his attitude/offering, Cain
and his jealousy drives him to anger and ultimately to murder.  GOD punishes
Cain for killing his brother by making it difficult for him to plant and
harvest the produce of the land.  Even though GOD has sentenced Cain, GOD still
shows compassion and vows to protect Cain from persecution, even promising
worse punishment on those who would harm or kill Cain. Thus, the ancient “law”
of more retaliation than merely an eye for the an eye is seen.  The law of
exacting only equal punishment will not become a part of Jewish Law until the
time of Moses (lex talonis - Leviticus 20: 24).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm has a couple of links to the First Reading. 
The first is GOD’s response to sacrifices.  GOD does not just want continual
sacrifices unless there is the right spirit and sense of obedience behind the
offerings.  The second is the reference to doing things against one’s brothers/sisters
(the offsprings of one’s parents, but it can be extended to brothers and
sisters in the Lord Jesus).  And just as GOD saw what Cain did to his brother,
GOD is always aware of how siblings (whether they be blood siblings or
community siblings) treat each other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the Gospel, the religious authorities demand a sign
from Jesus.  They want Jesus to demonstrate His power, not so that they might
believe in Him but because they wanted to test Him and hopefully catch Him in
some sort of trap.  Jesus refuses to perform a miracle or do something wondrous
merely to be used against Him.  Jesus reaches out with mighty deeds because
people are in need of GOD’s healing in their lives, not for vindictive and
selfish purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Once again our scripture passages describe human
nature. We might be able to see ourselves in some of the characters and their
attitudes in today’s readings.  Sometimes we are like Cain.  We perform some
sort of ritual, expecting to be rewarded, but we do not have the right attitude
when we make an offering to GOD.  The purpose of presenting a gift to GOD
should not be so that we might receive something in return.  We should praise
and worship GOD for GOD’s sake, not for what GOD might do for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Another way we might be like Cain is in our jealousy
when others seem to be having a better response to their actions than we do to
ours.  Rather than try to see how we might improve our action, we instead often
try to put the other persons down, either emotional or, as in Cain’s extreme case,
physically.  We think it is easier to remove the competition or knock the other
person down rather than try to better ourselves and raise our bar to higher
level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Some of us may act like Cain also when it comes to our
fear of being punished even for things for which we deserve to be punished.  We
are afraid of others’ reaction against us.  We cry out to GOD to protect us and
help us from being hurt, even though we have been less than understanding and
considerate of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      At other times we might identify with the religious
authorities in today’s Gospel.  We want GOD to do something special for us, not
because we need it or because it will bring us closer to GOD, but because we
want to test GOD and make GOD prove the mightiness of GOD.  And when GOD
doesn’t do what we ask of (or even demand from) GOD, we use that against having
a relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father.  We almost say, “See, I
knew I shouldn’t put all my trust in GOD!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Scriptures present a very intra-perceptive view of our
sinful condition.  All of us fail to live up to what GOD expects of us.  There
is, however, GOoD News:  GOD loves us anyway!  GOD is willing to renew a
covenant relationship with us.  All we need do is turn to the Lord Jesus, admit
our failings and accept the gift of faith that GOD offers us.  It demands a
constant tuning into GOD.  It is similar to a traveler (whether it be at sea,
in a car, a plane, or space craft).  We may be heading in the basic direction,
but there is always a need to check our bearings and make mid-course
corrections as we see that we are getting off-track.  If not, we may find
ourselves so far off course that it will take major maneuvering to get us back
on target.  Part of what gets us back on track is our acknowledging GOD for Who
GOD is and giving GOD the glory and praise that is due.  Let us join in today’s
psalm refrain and “Offer to GOD a sacrifice of praise!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  With what human
attribute described in today’s readings do I most identify at this point in my
life?  Expecting mere ritual to appease GOD? Jealousy over another’s position
relationship with GOD?  Desiring to put others down so I can get higher? 
Fearful of punishment?  Seeking GOD to do things for my selfish reason? 
Looking for an excuse not to have a relationship with GOD?  What must I do to
change my attitude and get back on course to GOD?  How can I reach out to
others and assist them in heading toward GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever ready to help us draw
closer to Yourself.  Through Your GOoDness, You remind us through Your Holy
Word how misguided we mortals are when we are left to our own devices.  It is
so easy for us to get off course and follow our weakened human nature.  Through
the ministry of Your Son, Jesus, You continue to call us to metanoia – change
of heart and direction.  You have sent Him to be our Guide along the path to
You.  For the times we have left the true course and become misaligned from
that course, we ask Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the inspiration and
direction of Your Holy Spirit, help us to focus always on our end goal – being
eternally with You.  May we continually offer You our sacrifice of praise, for
in so doing we fall in line with the Way, Your Son, Jesus.  It is in His name
that we make this prayer, for He is Our Lord and Savior Who has given us the
example to follow and Who is now living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you continue to edify and build up those who have been
entrusted to your care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember talking with a friend about people with power and
authority.  We discussed how some people let the power they have been given go
to their heads and they seek to benefit from their privileged position.  Others
who are in authority see the responsibility they have been given as the
priority in their lives of service.  They realize that they must serve the
needs of others and help build up and edify those over whom they have been
given authority.  We agreed that we must pray for all who are in roles of
leadership:  politicians, parents, teachers, bosses.  May they all realize that
they have not only been given privileged positions, but also they have been
given great responsibility by the GOD Who is over all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed John of Fiesole:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 6: 5-8; 7: 1-5, 10;     Psalm 29: 1a and
2, 3ac-4, 3b and 9c-10;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mark 8: 14-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Our readings speak about power and how those in
authority use that power.  Our First Reading is part of the story of Noah and
the Flood.  The psalm presents the majesty and power of GOD.  In the Gospel,
Jesus warns His disciples about the leaven of the religious and civil
authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In today’s account of the Noah story, we see GOD
portrayed as being frustrated by the disobedience and sinfulness of mortals. 
GOD has created them and found them very GOoD in the beginning.  Yet, when left
to their own free will, the majority of humanity has turned away from GOD and
has chosen evil.  Noah and his family are the only exceptions.  GOD plans to
allow water, one of the essentials of life, to be the source of the destruction
of life that has turned its power to negative ends.  Only those humans and
animals in the ark are to be saved.  Once Noah has built the ark according to
GOD’s directions (in the verses that are part of those omitted from today’s
First Reading - Genesis 6: 14-16) while being ridiculed by his neighbors, GOD
tells Noah to take into the ark a couple of each animal.  He is also directed
to take more of the clean animals (those to be used in sacrifice).  Once inside
the safety of the ark, they wait for seven days before the Flood begins.  We
will hear more about the Flood in the First Reading for the rest of this week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm speaks of the majesty of GOD as seen in some
of the natural phenomenon such as a storm.  The repetition of the phrase “the
voice of the LORD” is meant to resemble the crash of thunder.  GOD is seen as
the force behind the storm, even more powerful than a flood, an event that
frightened the nomadic tent people of the desert.  (Some may wonder what it
means when the psalm uses the words, “The LORD is enthroned above the flood.” 
I look at the diagram which I include to the right.  GOD’s throne is on top of
diagram. The flood waters are the “Waters above” GOD’s throne is thus in
Heaven.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the Gospel, Jesus speaks to His disciple as they
travel in a boat. He warns them about the leaven of the religious and civil
authorities (Pharisees and Herod).  The disciples, as usual, misunderstand
Jesus’ message.  They still are thinking on the merely earthly level of food. 
Jesus chides them to think “outside of the boat.”  Leaven was a powerful
force.  It caused bread to rise, but if left unchecked it could be
destructive.  Jesus warns them not to let things get out of control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      As I reflected on the readings, I am struck by the
similarity in the power of water and leaven.  Both can be positively
growth-filled, and also negatively destructive.  What is important is the
control of these forces.  GOD obviously can control that which GOD has created
and use what has been created to bring about the divine plan.  We, on the other
hand, sometimes let things get out of control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Jesus warns His disciples (including us) about not
letting things get out of control.  What we do can be used in a positively
up-building sort of way, or it can become destructive.  This applies to what we
say.  It also applies to how we treat others.  The challenge for us is to make
decisions that will lead to positive and edifying experiences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Too many people, especially those with power, tend to
use the control they have over things and people for a negative end.  A couple
obvious recent day examples of that would be the former Osamu bin Laden and the
former Saddam Hussein and President Putin of Russia.  Some would even say that
our former president before President Biden.  Those who have power need to
conscientiously think about the repercussions of their actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      How does that apply to me?  I, too, must be aware of
how my thoughts, words, and actions can be edifying or ruinous for myself and
others.  I need to see if what I think and say and what I do is bringing about
growth opportunities for others.  As a teacher and a leader, I have realized
that my comments or actions have had an important effect on my students and
those under me.  If I say something negative about one of those who have been
entrusted to my care, I can cause damage to his/her understanding of who he/she
is in the eyes of GOD.  I must be sure that I act with love, which does not
mean that I am overly gushy or falsely flattering.  Speaking the truth in love,
as St. Paul says in Ephesians 4: 15, is what I am called to do.  It means that
I may have to say something that is challenging, but the purpose for doing so
is to announce the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus to them.  The GOoD News of the
Lord Jesus can cause a person to re-think the values she/he has.  Speaking the
truth in love can be, and often is, painful both for the speaker and for the
hearer, but it should not be done in a malicious (non-loving) way.  Those who
have been entrusted with the power, especially the power of the Truth, must use
it in the way that GOD intends it to be used, in leading people to a closer
relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, in the unity of the Holy
Spirit.  If we use the power GOD has entrusted to us, then we will loudly echo
today’s psalm and say:  “Give to the LORD, you children of GOD, give to the
LORD glory and praise!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I use the
power that GOD has given me?  Do I use it for my own selfish ends, or do I seek
to use it in a way that speaks the truth in love?  Do I provide an atmosphere
in which people can experience the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus, and grow in
their relationship with GOD?  How can I use the power and gifts GOD has given
me today – and who might benefit from what I do?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all powerful and almighty. 
Through Your GOoDness, You know the effects of power and use it for the GOoD of
all Your creation.  You have entrusted Your power to others, to be used for the
betterment of all.  Yet as creatures who have free will without perfect
knowledge or desire, we as individuals and as communities have abused the power
that You have entrusted to us.  We have used the forces we have to get what we
want at the expense of others whom we have had to hurt on our way to getting to
where we want to go.  We seek Your pardon and forgiveness for not using the
gifts You have given us and the responsibility You have assigned to us for the
benefit and edification of others.  With the inspiration and guidance of Your
Holy Spirit, help us to follow the example of Your Son, Jesus, Who used His
divine power to announce Your GOoD News and do Your will.  We lift up this
prayer to You in and through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who is now living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.    <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>​May the Lord continue the process of drawing you and others
ever close to our GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For many years I have worked in Stephen Ministry.  One of
the topics of covered during the 50 hours of initial training is “changing
one’s orientation from being result-oriented to being process-oriented.”  So
often we desire to have immediate, positive response to what we are doing. 
Yet, GOD often works in stages.  Similarly, in my work in the Order of
Christian Initiation of Adults, we do not “teach a class” that gives
information, we are involved in a “process of Christian formation.”  I am
reminded of a sign/bumper sticker that proclaims, “Be patient with me – GOD is
not finished with me yet.”  Just as with any human relationship, our
relationship with GOD is a process that takes a lifetime.  And, according to my
own way of thinking, our relationship with GOD is a process that will take all
eternity.  Thank GOD, that we are offered eternal life to develop in that
process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Conrad of Piacenza</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Genesis 8: 6-13, 20-22;        Psalm 116: 12-13,
14-15, 18-19;          Mark 8: 22-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      GOD often works in our lives in a series of
occurrences.  It is sometimes a gradual process in the way our faith
relationship develops.  We often want immediate results from GOD, but GOD
touches our lives over a period of time.  This can be seen in our readings. 
The story of Noah continues with the sending out of the birds to see if the
land had dried from the flood.  Noah did this over the course of a few weeks. 
The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for all the great things GOD has done and
continues to do.  The Gospel is the account of the healing process that brought
sight to a blind man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Today’s account of the Flood and Noah in the ark has
skipped over the mushy stuff [is that clear or is still too muddy?].  We do not
hear about the 40 days of rain and the 120 days of waiting for the water to go
down.  [if you are interested you can read chapter 7 and the beginning of
chapter 8 on your own.]  In the passage we read today, Noah first sends out a
raven.  He follows that with the sending of a dove, who returns with nothing. 
A week later he sends out the dove again, and this time it returns with an
olive twig in its beak.  [Nice imagery, I think we should use that at this time
in our world history!]  The next time the dove is released it does not return,
since it has found some place to perch.  Once the waters have receded and the
ark finds its resting place, Noah offers a sacrifice to GOD and GOD promises
never to wipe out all the earth again (although GOD does not promise that we
will not prevent us from destroying it because of our own stupidity and misuse
of natural resources).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm echoes the feeling Noah must have had as he,
his family, and all the animals exit from the ark.  It is a prayer thanking GOD
for all the wonderful things GOD has done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Gospel relates Jesus’ healing of a blind man, not
all at once, but in stages.  It is a process of healing.  This does not mean
that Jesus did not do a GOoD job when He touched the man’s eyes the first
time.  Some scholars see in it the parallel to how people grow gradually in
their faith.  They do not clearly see everything all at once.  It starts out a
bit fuzzy, and only over a period of time, does it come into sharp focus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      My reflection today focuses on the concept of
“process.”  Noah does not end up on dry land the moment the days and nights of
rain stop.  He is not sure the waters have receded until he goes through a
process of sending out birds to scout the waters for signs of things surfacing
from the watery depths.  It is a process.  Similarly, the blind man in today’s
Gospel is healed by a multi-step process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Yes, many things, even divine things, sometimes happen
immediately.  GOD can say, “let there be light” and immediately there is
light.  GOD can work wonders (miracles) in a flash of a moment.  Yet, often GOD
allows things to develop over a period of time, through a process of continual
growth or development.  [I am reminded of a saying which goes something like
this:  “Nothing is impossible with GOD.  The impossible just takes longer in
human estimation of time.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In this age of instant coffee, fast food,
instantaneous access to information on television and on the Internet, we
expect things to happen immediately [unless we are using a slow connection to
the Internet].  We want results right now.  We are not very patient when it
comes to waiting and going through a long, sometimes drawn out, process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Yet, the fact is, much of life is a process.  I
remember talking to a friend who was recovering from an illness.  This person
wanted to be better right now.  It was hard to wait for days, weeks, even
months for the healing process to be over and returning to a normal way of life
could begin again.  It was not easy being a patient patient.  People over the
last couple years were hoping for a quick end to the Covid Crisis, but it took
its time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Our relationship with GOD is also a process.  Oh,
there are those times, at least with some people, when they have a religious
experience and they are suddenly enlightened with the whole picture, but that
is not the normal way.  GOD has revealed the GOoD News over a period of time
and through a process that builds upon the seeds of faith planted over a long
period of time.  As I think back on my own life, I believe that I had a
relationship with the Lord Jesus from my earliest recollections, but that does
not mean that I “knew” Jesus and His Abba-Father and the Holy Spirit in the
same way that I “know” GOD today.  It has been a process of growing,
contemplating, re-orienting my views of, and growing in relationship with, GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      This has had an effect on my ministry, my announcing
of the GOoD News of GOD.  I must proclaim the GOoD News in a process-oriented
way.  That means with some people I must gradually build a relationship with
them.  It starts with my evangelizing (“GOoD Newsing”) them first by my
actions.  I treat individuals with the GOoD News before I speak to them about
the GOoD News.  They must first come to experience GOoD News in the way I deal
with them before they are ready to hear it in my words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      It also means that I must be willing to journey along
with them as long as GOD wants me to travel along with them.  I am not there to
get immediate results, but to be with them as they go along the way to GOD.  I
cannot be goal-oriented in my ministry.  If all I want is “to chalk another one
up for the Lord Jesus,” then I am not being faithful to the GOD of
relationships.  It is not a numbers game of how many people I can bring to the
GOD.  It is a relational process of being with them as we together follow the
Way to the house of our Abba Who happens to be GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Yes, GOD does wonderful things.  Sometimes it is
instantaneous, but many times GOD acts through a process.  No matter what, we
must be willing to give GOD all the glory and praise, or as today’s psalm puts
it: “How shall I make a return to the LORD for all the GOoD GOD has done for
me?  The cup of salvation I will take up, and I will call upon the name of the
LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my reaction
when it seems that GOD is taking too much time to respond to my prayer?  Am I
more interested in results or in being part of a process of GOD working in my
life and/or in the lives of others?  Who has been instrumental in the process
of my growing in the faith?  How can I show my willingness to serve the Lord
Jesus and be a part of others in the process of their growing in relationship
with Jesus and His Abba, in the unity of the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, worker of wonders.  Through
Your GOoDness, You have revealed Yourself over the course of time, reaching a
climax in the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Your Son, Jesus. 
Jesus continues to draw people into the relationship that You desire to have
with them, acting through a process in which You have allowed us to share.  At
times we have been impatient, not wanting to stay the course during the
process, but desiring results immediately.  For our lack of patience and
unwillingness to focus on the whole process, we ask Your forgiveness.  Help us
to minister and announce Your GOoD News to others, to become aware of the
process, and not to worry about the results.  You will bring about the result
that You want if we are willing to journey along with others as Your Son leads
us to You.  We give You thanks and praise for all the GOoD You have done for us
and continue to do for us.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son
and our Brother, Who is traveling with us and ahead of us to Your house, where
He is also living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.     <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>​May the Lord continue the process of drawing you and others

<p class=MsoNormal>May you continue to proclaim Jesus as the Christ, the
Anointed One of GOD, not only in words but also in your actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We call ourselves Christians – people who believe in the
“Christ” (the “Messiah,” the “Anointed One” of GOD).  It is absolute imperative
that we proclaim Jesus as the Christ.  Yet, like Peter in the Gospel today, we
often have our own interpretation of what the Messiahship of Jesus means.  We
try to have Jesus fit into our plan, rather than trying to fit ourselves into
GOD’s plan of having Jesus as the Christ.  Our lives must give witness
(martyrizo) to Jesus.  People must see that we are desiring to be like our
Master-Teacher and come to a fuller relationship with Him through the way we
lovingly treat them.  Then we can authentically be called Christians –
proclaimers of Jesus, the “Christ.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Jacinta and Francisco Marta:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 9: 1-13;         Psalm 102: 16-18, 19-21,
29 and 22-23;       Mark 8: 27-33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      We have reached the conclusion of the flood account. 
With it, a new covenant relationship is made between GOD and the human race. 
The psalm portrays GOD as sitting above the clouds looking down at creatures
crying out to the LORD, and GOD responding to their needs.  In the Gospel,
Jesus asks about how do others, and then how do the disciples, see Jesus. 
Following St. Peter’s declaration of the Messiahship of Jesus, Jesus presents a
further view of what that means and this new view does not go over well with
Peter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The flood is presented as a new start, a new
“creation” for humanity and all life on earth.  Things change.  GOD again makes
a covenant (establishes a bond or relationship) with mortals.  Many of the same
commands GOD gave Adam are repeated to Noah.  Noah, as Adam before him, is
entrusted with the care of the rest of creation.  This passage also sees a
switch from the vegetarianism, which was the norm before the flood, to a
carnivorous lifestyle after the flood.  GOD establishes a reminder, a sign of
the covenant – the rainbow.  With this, mortals are reminded of GOD’s promise
never to destroy the whole world again by a flood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm presents the image of GOD as grand potentate
sitting on a throne in the sky, looking down at the creatures below.  GOD
responds to the pleas of the people needing help.  This imagery fits well into
the picture following the flood.  It is almost as if the rainbow becomes the
pathway and bond between GOD and the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Gospel today has two distinct sections.  First
Jesus asks His disciples what people are saying about Him.  They repeat what
they have heard others say about Him, i.e., that He is a prophet, or Elijah, or
John the Baptist raised from the dead.  Jesus then asks them the all-important
question:  “Who do you say that I am?”  Peter, taking his role of leader
seriously, professes his belief that Jesus is the Messiah, the Christ, the
Anointed One of GOD.  Having heard this, Jesus tells them that they should not
yet share their view with others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The second section of today’s Gospel reading deals
with Jesus’ true perception of what Messiahship is.  Jesus explains what it
means for Him to be the Messiah:  He must suffer and die at the hands of the
religious leaders, but He will be raised up on the third day.  Peter voices his
objection to this concept of Messiahship.  Jesus demonstrates His anger at
Peter’s tempting Jesus to take the easy way rather than doing His Abba-Father’s
will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I have always liked this Gospel.  It demonstrates both
the inspiration given to Peter and his humanness.  Peter has had a relationship
with Jesus for quite a while by this point.  He is beginning to see Jesus as
more than a wonder worker or a prophetic spokesperson for GOD.  He is led to
the realization that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah (Christ).  Peter,
following the view of most of his contemporaries, believed that the Messiah
would come in power and majesty and establish a new realm for the Jewish
people.  He is willing to profess his belief in Jesus, probably hoping to be
placed in a high position of honor in the coming realm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      When Jesus starts to explain that part of His role of
being the Messiah means having to suffer and die, it does not fit in with
Peter’s view of Messiahship.  Peter does not want to hear about that.  In
objecting to this view of Messiahship, Peter tempts Jesus to take an easier way
to establishing His reign on earth.  Yet, in doing this, Peter is acting just
as Satan did in the temptation in the desert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I can identify with Peter.  I sometimes get enthused
(“GOD within”) and excited.  I am willing to proclaim the GOoD News of Jesus. 
Yet, when I start to experience or even think about what witnessing
(“martyring”) might entail, I am not so willing to go along with GOD’s plan.  I
know I have sometimes been more of an obstacle to GOD’s plan than a proponent. 
I have had my ideas on how GOD should be doing things rather than trying to
make my plans reflect GOD’s plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Today I feel challenged to reflect on my relationship
with the Lord Jesus Christ.  It is a time for me to recommit myself to the Lord
Jesus and start off fresh, just as Noah (and all with him) did after the
flood.  GOD will manifest signs of this renewed covenant relationship with me. 
I need to admit the times that I have blocked the Lord Jesus from fully
operating in my life and the lives of others.  I must also be willing to fully
cooperate with GOD’s plan not only for my life, but also the lives of others. 
I must seek to give GOD the glory and praise that is due, subjecting my ideas
to those of the Lord Jesus.  In this way I can truly proclaim Jesus as the
Christ, not just in words, but also in my very living and acting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Whom do I say that
Jesus is for me?  Do I seek to proclaim Him as my Lord only when He does what I
expect or ask Him to do?  Am I able to submit to His Lordship and seek to
follow Him and His plan for my life, particularly when the plan is not what I
hoped it would be?  Can others experience Jesus’ reigning in my life?  Are
others drawn into a closer relationship with the Lord Jesus because of my
witnessing to Who Jesus is?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and always
wishing to re-establish a covenant relationship with Your people.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continue to offer that binding relationship to us.  You are
willing to renew that bond again and again.  That is true religion (re = again;
ligio = bonding).  We have often misunderstood Your plan and worked against its
full implementation because of our narrow-mindedness.  Help us to affirm the
role of Jesus as Your Anointed One, the Messiah, the Christ.  Through the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, let us proclaim in word and in action that
Jesus is the fulfillment of Your plan, the sign of the relationship You have
established with us.  We lift up our prayers of praise and thanksgiving to You
in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who truly is the Christ, and
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

- Fri. of 6th Week in Ord. Time (Opt. Mem. of St. Peter Damian)     <a
href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May the Lord Jesus bless you as you continue to make choices
that reflect your desire to be His disciples, even at the personal cost of
losing what the world says is important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the greatest gift GOD gives to us is free choice.  We
can make decisions how we want to live our lives.  We can choose to only
satisfy our own wishes and seek fame, fortune, and pleasure, or we can follow
the path of our Master-Teacher Who came to announce GOoD News for all people
and to serve others rather than to be served.  It is tempting to only seek
immediate satisfaction for ourselves.  Yet, if we are willing to forego our own
selfish desires, GOD promises to share eternal life with us and with all those
who seek to live as disciples of the Master-Teacher.  The Lord Jesus desires us
to be with Him and His Abba-Father forever in heaven, but Jesus will not force
us into heaven against our will.  The choice is ours.​​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Peter Damian: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-peter-damian</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Genesis 11: 1-9;      Psalm 33: 10-11, 12-13,
14-15;      Mark 8: 34– 9: 1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     The readings today present a couple of alternatives in
life choices and show where those choices lead.  The Genesis passage is the
story of the building of the tower of Babel.  As a result of the attempted
building, the people’s ability to communicate is left in confusion.  The psalm
echoes the theme of the First Reading by declaring that GOD brings to nought
the plans of nations.  The Gospel presents Jesus’ invitation for His followers
to follow Him to eternal life, even if it means dying on the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     The story of the tower of Babel gives us a lot to think
about today, since the sites of Babel and Babylon are in the present country of
Iraq.  The tower that is built probably referred to the ziggurats that were
setup in the city of Babel when a foreign queen married the king of Babel. 
Since she had grown up in a hilly country, she missed the hills and the rich
vegetation found there.  The ziggurats were artificial hills with gardens so
the queen could have her raised viewing area above the flat, barren country of
Mesopotamia.  The point of the Biblical account focuses on the supposed
attitude of the builders.  They wanted to be famous for building this
skyscraper.  They were trying to make their way to heavens where their gods
were believed to live.  In the anthropomorphic language of the Bible, GOD comes
down from the heavens to see what they are building and is upset with their
pompous attitude.  Thus, GOD confuses their language so that they can no longer
communicate with each other.  In English, the word, “babel,” meaning “a
confused noise made by a number of voices” comes from this Biblical passage. 
The ancient native word for the city of Babel was Babili (which means “gate of
the gods”).  The Hebrew word for “confused” is balil, thus there is a play on
the words.  The “gate of the gods” ends up “confusing” the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     It is with this last understanding that today’s psalm
makes even more sense when it begins with the words:  “The LORD brings to
nought the plans of nations; the LORD foils the designs of peoples.”  GOD’s
plan and GOD’s ways last forever and they are the only things that make sense
in the long run. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     The Gospel relates Jesus’ invitation for His followers
to commit themselves and become His disciples (“disciplined learners” who do as
their Master-Teacher does).  It means they must do three things:  1) deny
themselves; 2) take up the cross; and 3) follow Jesus.  The Greek word for deny
oneself is ἀπαρνέομαι (aparneomai) that means “a total rejection of one’s ideas
so one can fully commit to the ideas of one’s leader.”  The follower becomes ὁμολογέο 
(homologeo), able “to speak the same:” as the Master-Teacher.  One who is a
true disciple willingly espouses (unites as if married to) the beliefs of the
Leader. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     The obvious next step in following Jesus is being
willing to take up one’s cross, or as the Gospel mentions, give up one’s life
for the sake of Jesus and His GOoD News (Gospel).  That means being one with
the Master-Teacher in as complete a way as one can be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     We have seen a sort of similar type of total commitment
in some of the cults that have arisen of old and in our days.  People pledge
their undying (and willingness for “dying”) allegiance to a cause and its
leader.  One difference might be that many of these people do so because of
fear or brain-washing rather than a complete freedom of choice.  Jesus invites
His follower – His disciples/disciplined learners – to freely make this
choice.  He does not want coerced or fearful followers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     Thus, our readings give us two choices:  1) we can
choose to do things that center on ourselves, seeking to become famous or rich
(like the people of Babel); or 2) we can focus on the Lord Jesus and become His
committed, disciplined disciples.  Where our choices lead is also laid out
before us.  If we choose the first path, it may lead to temporary fame and
fortune, but ultimately to confusion, dispersal, and eternal death.  The second
choice may result in temporary pain and suffering, but ultimately in an
eternal, joy-filled life with GOD.  As a former mathematics teacher, I could
put it into other words:  option 1 is a large, but a decreasing finite number,
whereas option 2 is infinity.  The choice is ours and GOD knows the disposition
of our hearts even better than we do ourselves.  It is thus that the psalm
says:  “The LORD, Who fashioned the heart of each, the LORD knows all their
works.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is the focus
of my life?  Do I seek fame and glory from other people, or do I seek to be on
the path (painful though it may be) to eternal life with the Lord Jesus and His
Abba-Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit?  In what ways am I willing to deny
myself and become even more dedicated to the will of GOD?  How can I manifest
my following of the Lord Jesus in the way I deal with people in my everyday
life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     Blessed are You, LORD GOD, creator of order and life. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have allowed us to freely choice our path in life,
even though You desire we take the one that leads to eternal life with You. 
You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to invite us into an ever-deepening relationship
with Him and with You.  Yet, because we sometime are limited by our narrow
vision, we choose immediate and temporary goals that lead ultimately away from
You (a theos).  Jesus calls us to be His disciples.  He tells us that it will
mean looking beyond the present to a future, eternal life.  In the process we
may have to suffer, and we will die to our attachments to this earthly life,
but what awaits us is a joy-filled, never-ending relationship with Him and with
You.  Give us the strength and wisdom to accept Jesus’ invitation of being His
disciples.  By the inspiration and guidance of Your Holy Spirit, help us to
stay focused on our path to You, following the steps of Jesus, Who is the Way. 
We make this prayer in the name of the same Jesus, Your Son and our Brother,
Who journeys with us and Who has also gone before us into Your house where He
has prepared a place for us.  It is He Who is now living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.     <a

- Chair of St. Peter (replacing Sat. of 6th Week in Ord. Time)     <a
href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May the Lord Jesus continue to bless and guide those who are
called to service within the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the feast known as the Chair of St.
Peter.  We are not honoring the structure on which St. Peter or any popes have
sat.  We are looking at the office and ministry of those who shepherd the flock
of Christ.  It is the rightful duty of all Christians to pray for those who are
in leadership roles, especially for those who head the Church.  The imagery of
a shepherd comes into focus.  The word “pastor” comes from the Latin word for
“shepherd.”  We realize that those who are called to pastor the flock of the
Lord Jesus are to reflect the ministry (service) of the GOoD Shepherd.  All
those who are called to pastor others have not always fulfilled their calling,
since they are human.  Thus, we should continue to pray for all who lead,
especially for those whose ministry affects many people.  May all who are
called to serve the flock of Jesus follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit and
the example of the GOoD Shepherd.​​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chair of St. Peter: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/chair-of-saint-peter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:    1 Peter 5: 1-4;        Psalm 23: 1- 3a, 4, 5,
6;         Matthew 16: 13-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Today is the Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter.  We
reflect on the authority and responsibility of the earthly Head of the Church. 
St. Peter addresses other Church leaders in today’s First Reading, telling them
to be shepherds to the flock.  The psalm is the familiar Psalm 23 referring to
the LORD as the Shepherd.  In the Gospel, Peter proclaims his faith in Jesus
calling Him the Messiah, the Son of GOD.  Jesus then empowers Peter to lead the
Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the First Reading from the First Letter of St.
Peter, he addresses his fellow ministers (elders – presbyters – priests) and
servants.  He wants them to fulfill their duties as leaders with a spirit of
willingness, enthusiasm, and servitude.  Even at this early point in the
history of the Church, it seems that some of the leaders (to whom the care of
the flock of GOD had been entrusted) have been unfaithful in living out their
position as leaders.  Some are reluctantly, and probably complainingly, doing
only the minimal (if that) of what is required of them.  Others are using their
office for their own benefit.  Still others are acting like dictators in
ordering the people under their charge.  Peter reminds them that they will have
to answer to the Chief Shepherd, the Lord Jesus.  Those who have fulfilled
their calling as GOoD pastors (shepherds) will enjoy the heavenly reward in
store for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Although we have heard Psalm 23 so many times, it is
beneficial to reflect on it again.  It gives us an overview of how the GOoD
Shepherd cares for the sheep of GOD’s flock.  It thus becomes a role model for
others who share in the role of shepherding the flock of GOD.  With the GOoD
Shepherd around, the members of the flock have no worries for they sense that
the Shepherd will provide for them and lead them to green pastures and refresh
them besides clear water.  Even if the sheep have to travel along dark and
scary paths, they do not fear for the Shepherd is there with the staff to
protect them and keep them on the right path.  The Shepherd provides a rich
banquet for the members of the flock, while the enemies of the sheep (and thus
the enemies of the Shepherd) look on longingly.  The Shepherd makes sure that
the sheep enjoy GOoDness and kindness all of their days as they journey to, and
experience, the house of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Gospel today is Matthew’s account paralleling the
Gospel from Mark that was read two days ago.  In this Gospel, after Jesus has
asked the disciples what the people think of Him, He asks the disciples Who do
they say that He is.  Simon (Peter) boldly proclaims Jesus to be the Messiah
(the Christ, the Anointed One of GOD) and the Son of the Living GOD.  Jesus
first acknowledges that Simon has been led to say that by Jesus’ Abba-Father. 
Jesus then makes Simon the foundation of the Church and He gives Simon the
authority to lead the Church.  The name Peter is from the same root as the
Greek word, πέτρα (petra) meaning “rock.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Today we honor the position of the head of the Church,
the pope, who sits on the Chair of St. Peter.  The responsibility of being pope
is not an easy one.  Although the pope is given infallible authority when he
speaks ex cathedra (“from the chair”) concerning matters of faith and morals,
it does not mean that every pope in the nearly 2000 years of the Church’s
history has been a perfect human being.  [There have only been two officially
declared infallible statements.  cf: http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Papal_infallibility.]  In fact, as we read in scriptures, Peter himself
made poor judgments and even denied any connection with Jesus on the night
before Jesus died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The leader of the Church has sometimes used the title
of “servant of the servants of GOD.”  This is an appropriate description of
what the role of the pope is.  The pope is to be a servant-leader to all who
seek to serve the Lord Jesus and His flock.  In his pontificate of nearly
twelve years, our current successor to St. Peter, Pope Francis, has given us a
positive example of servant-leadership.  He is constantly reaching out in a
loving and caring way as one who is serving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The role of the Head of the Church is to imitate the
Chief Shepherd and realize that ultimately all authority resides in the Chief
Shepherd (the Lord Jesus).  The pope is to continue to shepherd not “his”
(i.e., the pope’s) flock, but the flock of the Lord Jesus.  St. Peter in his
letter reminds us what that means:  not being self-serving but caring for
others, setting a GOoD example, willingly and lovingly meeting the true needs
(not necessarily the wants) of those entrusted to his care.  It is true that
GOD inspires and guides the earthly shepherd of souls, but, except for matters
of faith and morals as he sits upon his chair of authority (ex cathedra), he
has free will not to accept GOD’s direction.  Over the course of the 2000
years, we have had individuals who have used their position as Head of the
Church for their own gain, wealth, and power.  Yet, more often, the persons who
have sat on the Chair of St. Peter have shepherded the flock to the best of
their ability, lovingly, caringly, and humbly doing what is best for the flock,
so that the flock would journey safely through the dark valley and arrive at
the eternal repose in the heavenly Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I must pray that the pope might serve the flock of
Jesus as GOD would have him do.  Over the years of my life, I might not have fully
agreed with everything the popes have done or said in their ministry as Head of
the Church, yet I owe my respect to the ones who have sat, and the one who
currently sits, on the Chair of St. Peter.  I am grateful to GOD for the way
the popes (including Pope Francis) have tried to be the “Servant of the
Servants of GOD.”  May Jesus – the Chief Shepherd – give to the present pope
the unfading crown of glory when he meets the Lord Jesus.  And may his
successors also serve the flock of GOD with enthusiasm, love, and inspiration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What do I see as
the role of the human shepherd (the pope) whom Jesus calls to the service of
others?  Do I pray for all the human leaders of the flock (shepherds/pastors)
of the Lord Jesus, asking that they be faithful to the one and only GOoD
Shepherd?  How can I share in the role of helping to shepherd those whom GOD
has entrusted to my care?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever faithful and true. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have empowered individuals to continue the ministry
of Your Son, the GOoD and Chief Shepherd.  May those who are entrusted with
this ministry of service fulfill that ministry to the best of their ability,
always listening to the guidance of Your Holy Spirit.  May we continue to show
our respect for those who are given the authority to lead, praying for all our
spiritual leaders, asking that they be faithful to the calling that comes from
You.  May they seek to do Your will, not selfishly nor for their own benefit, but
with the servant mentality of Jesus Your Son, Who came not to be served but to
serve and to give His life for others.  It is in Jesus’ name we make this
prayer, for He is our GOoD Shepherd, our Guide, Our Way, the Truth, and the One
Who continues to care for us in and through the ministry of others, and Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.    <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

- Seventh Sunday in Ord. Time       <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you continue to experience the love of GOD and be
willing to share it with others, even those with whom you have disagreements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people wonder about GOD’s love.  They ask, “If GOD
loves us, why do GOoD people suffer?”  Or they might voice the question, “How
can GOD love those who are so hateful that they go out and hurt whomever they
can?”  Part of the answer to those questions come from what GOD’s love is all
about.  GOD loves unconditionally.  GOD loves both sinners and saints.  GOD is
willing to give everyone chances to experience divine love and respond to that
love.  Yes, people will have to answer for the way they have responded to GOD’s
love. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s love is beyond full human understanding.  We are asked
to reflect on the love that Jesus demonstrated by His coming to earth,
teaching, healing, suffering, dying, and rising.  We are then expected to
imitate our Master-Teacher and love others the way the Lord Jesus has loved
us.​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Polycarp:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Samuel 26: 2, 7-9, 12-13, 22-23;          
Psalm 103: 1-2, 3-4, 8, 10, 12-13;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                1 Corinthians 15:
45-49;                           Luke 6: 27-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Being a disciple of Jesus demands that we raise
ourselves to a higher level of action and thought – a level of agape (love) – a
spiritual level – while not forsaking our earthly ties.  In the First Reading
we hear the account of King Saul being in the hands of David, yet David having
mercy on the very enemy who is out to kill him.  The Responsorial reminds us
that the LORD GOD, like a loving parent, is kind and merciful, even to those
who repeatedly do not do what is asked of them.  St. Paul speaks of the fact
that through the Last Adam (Jesus) we (the earthly descendants of the First
Adam) are raised to a new, spiritual level.  In the Lucan Gospel of today,
Jesus continues His Sermon on the Plain, challenging His disciples to a new
level of loving others – that of loving one’s enemies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The jealous King Saul is searching for David, the one
who will be the next King of Israel.  The jealous Saul desires to eliminate
David’s access to the throne by killing him.  Today’s account, which is one of
the two accounts in which Saul is placed at the mercy of David, David shows his
respect for GOD’s anointed one.  David has a rightful motive to kill Saul,
after all Saul is trying to kill him.  David is tempted by his advisors to do
away with Saul.  David realizes that GOD is to be the judge of Saul.  David’s
higher calling is not to revenge, but to be loving and compassionate with the
one whom GOD had first called to be the anointed King of Israel.  David knows
at the right time – GOD’s time – he will rightfully take the throne of the
kingdom of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Responsorial today (“The LORD is kind and
merciful”) summarizes the theme of the whole psalm.  It reminds us that GOD is
willing to pardon all our sins and not deal with us as our wrong doings
deserve, but as loving, compassionate parents care for their children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In his letter to the faithful in Corinth, St. Paul
shows his concern for the negative influence that the gnostics are having on
some of the members of the community.  According to the gnostic theology, the
physical world is totally negative, and the spiritual world alone is positive. 
Paul stresses that the believers have been given two kinds of life by GOD,
physical (earthly) life through the First Adam, and spiritual life through the
Last Adam (Jesus).  Earlier in the fifteenth chapter of his letter (last
Sunday’s Second Reading), Paul had stressed that the followers of Jesus can
expect a bodily resurrection just as Jesus experienced.  The new life that
Jesus brings will not be totally void of physicality.  Jesus has redeemed the
whole person – body and soul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Gospel today presents the Golden Rule and even
raises it up to a higher level.  Not only should we treat others as we would
want to be treated, not only should we love those from whom we expect love in
return, but also, we are called to love our enemies and lovingly treat people
whom we know will not treat us in the same loving way.  In presenting this
attitude of life, Jesus surpasses the teachings of all other belief systems.  He
asks His disciples to love, pray for, and give to others without expecting
anything in return, except possibly receiving only hostilities.  Jesus
emphasizes that even if those whom we love do not respond in kind, the GOD (Who
sees all) will use the same generous unit of measure with us.  In fact, GOD
will even be more generous, more forgiving, and more loving toward us that we
are toward our worst enemy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      As I reflect on the readings, I am conscious of the
fact that Jesus raises the bar higher and higher for His disciples.  The goal
which Jesus places before us is to be like the loving, divine Abba-Father, Who
forgives, loves, and cares for us even while we are sinful.  We are also called
to be like the One Who calls us to be His disciples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      We may find this too much to achieve.  There is no way
we can be as forgiving, as loving, and as caring as GOD.  We will fail.  The
fact that we will not achieve such a high level of concern for others is not
what is to be the focus of our attention.  Our attention should be on the One
Whom we are trying to imitate.  The more we strive to keep our eyes on Jesus,
our Master-Teacher and upon His Abba, the more that Jesus can, and will, fill
in the gaps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      A few years ago, at the early morning Bible Study I attend
on Tuesdays, we talked about what love is.  It was pointed out that there are
many words for “love” in Greek.  One Greek word that is translated as “love” is
eros (from which we get the English word “erotic”).  This is what many people
understand as “love.”  It is the pleasurable, physical love that is experienced
between two lovers.  Another Greek word for “love” is philia, which is a love
out of duty or between friends.  Philiadelphia is the city of
“brotherly/adelphia love/philia” – love for one’s relative.  One other Greek
word for “love” is agape.  This is sometimes translated as “unconditional love”
or “love without strings.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the First Letter of John, the author describes GOD
as agape – “unconditional love” (1 John 4: 8).  In the Gospel of John, Jesus
uses this same word when He proclaims, “No greater love (agape) does one have
than to lay down one’s life for one’s friend.”  This type of love is the
essence of GOD.  This love is what we are called to have, even for our enemy. 
This type of love is not able to be given unless one is in relationship with
the source of this love – GOD.  The more we are in connection with GOD, the
more we are able to share GOD (Love) with others, even those who do not seek
our well-being.  This is the type of love that Jesus holds up as the goal of
our life – that higher level to which He calls us.  In John 13: 34-35, Jesus
tells us to “love one another” as He has loved us.  This is what Jesus was
saying in the words of today’s Gospel:  “Be (lovingly) compassionate as Your
Abba is (lovingly) compassionate.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of
“love,” what comes to mind?  Do I think of caring for my worst enemy?  When I
contemplate how much GOD has loved me, in spite of my sinfulness, do I sense
what “love” is?  When have I experienced “unconditional” love from someone? 
Whom might I be called to love “unconditionally”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all love.  Through Your
GOoDness we have a share in Your Love.  You have blessed us with Your Love in
the person and ministry of Jesus, Your Son.  Jesus has empowered us, His
disciples, to share in that love.  We thank You for sending individuals who
have manifested the GOoD News of Jesus’ love to us.  As we reflect on how we
have passed on the love that we have received, we realize that we have not
always been faithful in this task.  For our failures to love as You and Your
Son have loved us, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the continued
outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, enable us to strive to be as compassionate and
loving as Your Son has been.  We give You all the praise, glory, and honor,
together with Your Son Jesus, Who is Master-Teacher and Savior, and Who
demonstrated Your unconditional love for us through His ministry, life, death,
and resurrection, and Who is now living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our One and only GOD for ever and ever.  Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May the Lord Jesus bless your prayer time and fill you with
Wisdom so that you may interact with others in the way GOD intends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the most caring individuals I have known operate
from a profound sense of Wisdom that astonishes all who come in contact with
these loving persons.  I have also noticed that these individuals often are
people of Prayer.  They spend quite a bit of time in reflection and deepening
their prayer life.  It is no accident that prayer-full people are usually wise
beyond their years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Luke Belludi:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 1: 1-10;        Psalm 93: 1ab, 1cd-2,
5;         Mark 9: 14-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Wisdom and prayer are the two key words from today’s
readings.  The Book of Sirach personifies Wisdom and tells how Wisdom was
present with GOD before the creation of the world.  The psalm glorifies GOD the
Supreme Ruler Who is clothed in splendor.  In the Gospel, Jesus casts out a
demon from a boy, a task that the disciples could not do because, as they found
out, it could only be done with “prayer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Wisdom has an integral relationship with GOD. 
Although Wisdom is distinct from GOD, Wisdom is with GOD as GOD creates the
world.  Wisdom is highly prized by the author of the Book of Sirach.  With this
understand it makes sense how Christian scholars have linked Hebrew Wisdom with
Greek Logos – the Word.  Jesus (the Word) epitomizes the attributes of Wisdom. 
Like Wisdom, the Word (GOD the Son) was present with GOD at creation.  Today’s
passage even says, “The Word of GOD on high is the fountain of Wisdom.”  No one
other than GOD can fully understand Wisdom.  Wisdom has always been seen as
closely linked with GOD.  In Eastern Christianity, many churches are named
Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom).  Wisdom is also linked with the Holy Spirit in this
First Reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm is a prayer of praise of GOD, Who is the
majestic Ruler Who created the world.  GOD is seen as the Great Potentate Who
comes in splendor and strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Gospel today follows the Transfiguration (which
would have been the Gospel reading on Saturday, if we hadn’t celebrated the
Chair of St. Peter).  As Peter, James, and John come down the mount with Jesus,
the other disciples are surrounded by a crowd of people.  A concerned father
brings forth his son who is besieged by an evil spirit.  The disciples had
tried to help the situation, but they could not.  Jesus seems upset with their
(both the crowd’s and His disciples’) lack of faith.  Jesus questions the
father about the boy.  The father remarks to Jesus, “Help us and have
compassion on us, if You can.”  Jesus remarks that with faith, all things are
possible.  Jesus expels the demon and returns the boy to his father.  Later, in
private, the disciples ask Jesus why they were not able to rid the boy of the
evil spirit.  Jesus simply remarks, “This kind can only come out through
prayer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      What strikes me about the readings is the importance
of both wisdom and prayer.  Jesus’ life and ministry are characterized by
both.  As I think further about them, I realize that prayer and wisdom are two
key elements of a relationship with GOD.  Jesus spends time in prayer (tuning
to His Abba-Father).  It is His (prayer-) relationship with His Abba that
empowers Him with wisdom and strength (both attributes of the Holy Spirit) to
be compassionate and to serve those who call out to Him.  Thus, in the time
Jesus spends in prayer, He is in touch with the other persons of the Blessed
Trinity.  The Triune GOD is a GOD of relationship, within the GODhead and
flowing out to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I feel challenged to spend more time in prayer, that
is, being in relationship with Jesus and His Abba and the Holy Spirit.  As I reflect
more on my relationship with the three persons in the One GOD, I am blessed
with the wisdom to think and do as Jesus does.  Wisdom is more than
intelligence.  Wisdom is not only knowing the right information, but it is also
using it in a way that builds up and enhances (edifies) people and their
relationship with GOD.  Wisdom is the characteristic that enables one to think
beyond oneself and see how one can make a difference in other people’s lives. 
It was divine Wisdom that guided Jesus in His ministry, enabling Him to reach
out and touch so many broken lives and bring them the GOoD News of salus
(healing, wholeness, salvation). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Although I will never have as close a relationship as
Jesus has with His Abba (since they have always been united with each other and
the Holy Spirit as the Triune GOD), I can grow in wisdom by spending time in
prayer.  With increased wisdom, I can continue to serve the people whom GOD has
placed along the pathway that leads us to GOD.  Being in faith relationship (i.e.,
prayer) with GOD and having a share in GOD’s wisdom makes all things possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of
Wisdom, what images and thoughts come to mind?  Do I see Wisdom as more than
just knowledge?  Do I spend enough time in developing my relationship with GOD
through prayer, so that I might live a life marked by Wisdom?  How can I be
more aware of reaching out to those who are in need, and acting with the Wisdom
that comes from GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of all Wisdom. 
Through Your GOoDness, You call us to share in that Wisdom through our
relationship with You and Your Son.  We deepen that relationship through
spending time at the feet of the Master-Teacher, in and through prayer.  We
have not always seen the wisdom of prayer.  For this we ask Your forgiveness. 
Continue to fill us with Your Holy Spirit (the Spirit of Wisdom), so we can
dedicate our lives to prayer; and, with the Wisdom we gain through prayer,
continue to empower us to go out and serve our sisters and brothers as Jesus
did.  We make this prayer through Your Son, Jesus, Who is Wisdom with skin on,
our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who has died, is risen, and now is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you experience the spark of GOD’s love in your life and
may that inflame your heart so that you are willing to share GOD’s love with
those whom you encounter in your daily journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An image that the Church uses to express the love of GOD is
that of a fire.  Fire is used to purify precious metals.  It also turns
darkness into light and bring hope and warmth into a cold and trying world. 
The fire starts as a small spark that then ignites the other fuel.  The fire
can be then transferred to other light-bearing items such as candles.  One such
experience is during the Easter Vigil when the Easter fire is used to light the
Paschal Candle, the symbol of the Risen Christ.  From the Paschal Candle’s
fire, all the other candles of the congregation are lit.  Soon the church is
aglow in the light of hundreds of candles.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the songs that our youth group uses during many of
our retreats is “Don’t Let the Fire Die.”  The song speaks about the need to
keep the fire burning, in spite of dark times in our lives, the dark times that
try to extinguish the fire of GOD’s love.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we always seek to keep the fire of GOD’s love burning in
our hearts and may we pass that fire onto others, especially those experience
darkness of evil and problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Sebastian of Aparicio:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 2: 1-11;        Psalm 37: 3-4, 18-19,
27-28, 39-40;        Mark 9: 30-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings challenge the faithful to be patient and
not to dwell on themselves or the rough times they are undergoing, but to look
to GOD and experience Divine Love.  The passage from Sirach includes words of
encouragement from an elder to a younger person.  It speaks of trusting GOD in
spite of rough times, for GOD will never forsake those who are faithful.  The
psalm echoes these sentiments and reassures the one who prays that GOD will
help those who seek the LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus tries to focus His
disciples on what it means to be faithful to His Abba-Father – being willing to
suffer wrongs and serve others, not worrying about who is the greatest of all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The selection from Sirach are words of parental
advice.  The words speak to the young about the importance of trusting GOD
especially in times of adversity.  The analogy of gold and silver being tested
(purified) in the fire is presented.  These precious metals are heated to the
melting point.  Since the gold or silver is heavier than the debris, they sink
and the impurities are on the top where they can be removed.  No matter what,
GOD will never forsake those who call on the name of the LORD GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalmist issues a similar promise in saying that
those who trust in the LORD and do GOoD, they will be taken care of by GOD.  If
one’s orientation is toward the LORD, GOD will help provide sufficient help to
get through the most difficult of times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Earlier in the ninth chapter of Mark’s Gospel, Jesus
has revealed His divine nature in the Transfiguration.  After allowing James,
John, and Peter to glimpse the future glory that He will have, Jesus speaks
about the path to that glory – through service, love, being rejected,
suffering, and ultimately experiencing death at the hands of others.  The
disciples miss the point of Jesus’ words and start to argue about which one of
them is the most important.  Jesus rebukes their attitude and challenges them
by saying if they wish to be first, they must be willing to serve the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      My reflection on the readings are influenced by the
death of a family friend.  She was eulogized by her husband as a woman of great
importance in the lives of many, many people.  This was because she was always
willing to serve.  She also modeled the First Reading by always trusting in
GOD, even when she faced trying times with the sickness and death of her first
husband due to cancer and her own intense back pain.  She was a woman of faith
and love.  She was faithful to both of her husbands, to her three children, to
her mother, to her co-workers, to those to whom she ministered at church.  Even
when suffering with extreme back pain, she always had a smile on her face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      One of the songs that was sung at this woman’s funeral
was “Pass It On.”  The words of the song begin:  “It only takes a spark to get
a fire going.  And soon all those around can warm up in its glowing.  That’s
how it is with GOD’s Love, once you have experienced it.  You’ll spread [GOD’s]
love to everyone.  You’ll want to pass it on.”   This woman truly had
experienced GOD’s love both in the joyful and sorrowful times in her life.  She
felt the need to pass GOD’s love on as she went about serving her family, her
faith community, and her spheres of influence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The challenge before me is to seek to pass on my
experience of GOD’s love.  It means I must avoid the temptation to try to think
of myself as the most important, as the disciples did in today’s Gospel.  I
must continue to turn to the Lord Jesus, trust GOD, and realize that even in
the midst of the most difficult moments of my life, GOD is with me, extending
Divine Love to me.  All I need do is focus on GOD’s love, let myself experience
that love and then pass it on by serving others so they can warm up in the glow
of GOD’s love that has begun as a spark in my life.  A beautiful image of
passing it on is when there is a candle service, such as the Easter Vigil, and
all the candles are light from the Easter-Christ Candle and passed from one
person to the next. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings are also appropriate this week, as we
think about Lent beginning in a week.  We are asked to reflect on our life as
disciples and see what we need to do to improve ourselves during the Lenten
season.  We will have the opportunity to reflect upon our relationship with GOD
and see how we might be more loving in our service of others, especially during
the season of Lent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I experience
a spark of GOD’s love in my life?  How did it affect me?  Have I been able to
hold onto that flickering of love during trying and difficult times?  Have I
been willing to share the flame of GOD’s love with others?  Who might benefit
most today, this week, from my passing on GOD’s love?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have put a spark of love in our lives through the various
experiences in our lives.  You have enkindled the flame in our hearts, if we
but spend the time to reflect on how You have loved us.  Even in the most
trying times, You are with us, purifying us within the fire of Your love.  We
have sometimes failed to be patient while You have touched our lives with Your
flaming love.  Help us to focus on how You have loved us, and You pass it on as
we spread that love to others, encouraging them in rough times, and supporting
them with our love.  We thank You for sending Your Love with skin on, so that
we could identify with Your Love Incarnate.  Through the power and inspiration
of Your Holy Spirit, help us to pass on Your love by serving those who cross
our paths.  As always, we make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Love
Incarnate, Who has demonstrated Your compassion for us through His own life of
service, His death, and His resurrection.  It is He Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you continue to grow in wisdom and in your relationships
– your relationship with GOD and your relationships with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to judge others, especially before we really
know them and try to understand from where they are coming and to where they
are heading.  We often assume we have the other people figured out and if they
are not thinking and acting like us, then they must be in the wrong.  We even
are tempted to challenge GOD and GOD’s ways of acting.  It all stems from not
really “knowing” Who GOD is and who other people are.  What we need is wisdom,
the wisdom of GOD.  The wisdom of GOD helps us see others the way GOD sees
them, and accept them for who they are.  The old native American saga is true: 
“We can never know another person without walking in their moccasins.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Maria Bertilla Boscardin:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Sirach 4: 11-19;       Psalm 119: 165, 168, 171,
172, 174, 175;       Mark 9: 38-40</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     The characteristics of a follower of GOD’s Wisdom are
presented in the readings today.  The Book of Sirach describes the benefits of
seeking the Wisdom of GOD.  The psalm proclaims the results of keeping GOD’s commands,
that are made possible by, and lead back to, Wisdom.  In the Gospel, Jesus
tells His disciples if others are doing GOoD things in His name, they should be
considered co-workers even if they are not considered part of the “regular
group.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     Wisdom is once again personified as a woman whom people
seek.  When people have a close relationship with Wisdom, they will experience
GOoD flowing in their lives.  They will have such gifts as life, position,
glory, divine blessings, and love.  What marked out the holy priests of old was
that they were in touch with Wisdom.  Wisdom was also the partner of the GOoD
judges who made decisions that reflected the Wisdom of GOD.  Those who have
come to “know” Wisdom will be rewarded, and so also their children will experience
GOD’s gifts.  On the contrary, those who want nothing to do with Wisdom, will
find life quite difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the longest psalm (Psalm 119) in the Bible, the psalmist
extols the benefit of following the directives that GOD has given.  Keeping the
commands should be done, not to avoid punishment, but because obedience to
GOD’s will brings joy, peace, and a sense of GOD’s salvation.  Doing GOD’s will
is part of having a relationship with the Wisdom of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     In the Gospel, the apostle John encounters individuals
who are performing miracles in the name of Jesus.  As John explains how he
tried to stop them, Jesus reassures John, and the other disciples, that those
who do GOoD in the name of Jesus (in line with Jesus’ mission) are to be
considered fellow servants in proclaiming the GOoD News.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     As I reflect on the readings, I realize how little I
really “know” about GOD’s ways.  I have had misunderstandings of what it means
to be a follower of Jesus.  Instead of trying to expand my understanding of
theological concepts, I should be seeking to “know” GOD’s Wisdom.  That only
comes from being in relationship with Jesus and His Abba-Father, in and through
the Holy Spirit.  Being obedient simply to avoid punishment is not what Wisdom
is all about.  Doing the right thing simply for the sake of saying that I did
the right thing is missing the point.  The point is to have an intimate, loving
relationship with GOD and all that flows from GOD toward others.  That is real
Wisdom.  It is no wonder the author of the Book of Sirach personifies Wisdom as
a woman to be desired, a lover to be sought, a person who can enhance one’s
life more than one can ever expect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     Yes, having an understanding of GOD’s precepts is GOoD,
but if it does not lead to a closer relationship with GOD, it is useless. 
Rules and laws, in and of themselves, cannot save or bring eternal life.  They
are only signposts along the way, and they point to the GOD Who wants us to
“know” the fullness (or as much of it as we can) of the divinity.  Wisdom
enables a person to “know” the purpose of the rules and laws – enhancing and
edifying the lives of others – and then gives the direction to fulfill the
purpose even beyond the required regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     I know I sometimes have acted like John in the Gospel. 
I have been upset when others (who have not been journeying along with me) act
in the name of the Lord Jesus.  In the past I have become suspicious of them
and their motives.  Now I am coming to a greater appreciation that if they are
truly ministering in the name of the Lord Jesus, then they are fellow servants
with me.  The key phrase is “in the name of the Lord Jesus.”  That is the
measuring stick that I need to use, not only when I look at what others are
doing, but more importantly when I reflect on what I am about.  Do I seek to
serve others “in the name of the Lord Jesus”?  That presumes that I have the
wise, intimate relationship with the Master-Teacher, that is, that I am in
contact with Him through reading the Word, praying, and being led by His Holy
Spirit.  I am also aware of others who are doing the GOoD that GOD intends
without their ever mentioning the name of the Lord Jesus.  These, too, I must
respect and thank GOD for their loving service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     The readings challenge me to look, not at my actions,
but at my relationship – my relationship first with the Lord Jesus and His Abba
and also my relationship with others.  I need to be sure that I am acting with
true Wisdom, using the guidelines that GOD has given me.  I should be doing it all
to edify and build up others – all for the glory of GOD.  If I can do that,
then I can echo the words of today’s psalm and say, “Those who love Your law
have great peace, and for them there is no stumbling block. . .Let my soul live
to praise You!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my reaction
when others with whom I may not be acquainted are doing GOoD deeds in the name
of the Lord Jesus?  How do I seek the Wisdom of GOD in my life?  How can I
bring the Wisdom of GOD to others today? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and source of
all wisdom.  Through Your GOoDness, You call us to a deeper relationship with,
and knowledge of, You and Your Way.  You have given us signposts along the path
to You.  We have sometimes unwisely followed other paths because we have not
taken seriously the pointers You have place along our trail.  We have lacked
the discernment to sense Your presence in the faithful activities of others who
do not seem to be fellow journeyers with us.  For our sinful and wrong
decisions and judgments, we seek Your pardon and peace.  You have sent Your Son
and allowed us and others to work in His name for the spread of Your reign. 
May we always be open to the right judgment and discernment that flows from
Your Holy Spirit.  As always we lift up to You our prayer of praise and
thanksgiving and we do it, as we should do all things, in the name of Your Son,
Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who is the Way back to You and Who is
already living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you sink your roots down deeply in the Lord Jesus so
that you may draw the life-giving gifts and be strengthened to resist evil and
assist those who need your help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Have you ever met a radical person?  What made the
individual seem like a radical?  Did you despise or admire the individual? 
Part of that depends on your definition of “radical.”  If you look up “radical”
in a dictionary you would get these definitions:  1) a person who holds or
follows strong convictions or extreme principles; extremist; 2) a person who
advocates fundamental political, economic, and social reforms by direct and
often uncompromising methods.   Most people are uncomfortable with radicals
because they seem to go beyond the ordinary way of acting.  Yet if we are
radical followers of the Lord Jesus, we will go beyond the ordinary (worldly)
way of acting and do what truly shows our strong conviction of being a disciple
of the Master-Teacher.  That does not mean we will act negatively towards
others, but on the contrary, we will show to Whom we are committed by being
just like our Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 5: 1-8;               Psalm 1: 1-2, 3, 4
and 6;              Mark 9: 41-50</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       Our scripture passages today give us quite a bit of
food for thought concerning our attitudes toward living as a follower of the
Lord Jesus.  The passage from Sirach warns against certain vices that can
destroy us.  The psalm presents a more positive approach in describing the
person who is virtuous.  In the Gospel, Jesus gives both positive (things for
which to strive) and negative (things to avoid) advice to His disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       The author of the Book of Sirach present vices that
should be avoided.  The attributes that should be shunned include seeking
riches at all costs, proud living, presuming to be overly self-sufficient to
the point of denying one’s need for GOD (presumption), trusting in things that
cannot bring true salus (healing, wholeness, salvation), failing to be
repentant.  Acting in such ways can only lead to one’s own destruction when GOD
judges with justice (mercy and anger). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       On the flip side of such vices, the psalm presents
the virtuous individual who trust completely in the LORD.  Such an individual
is compared to a tree that sinks its roots deeply down to the source of
life-giving water.  The virtuous individual, like the tree, will be able to
withstand stormy weather, arid conditions, and still produce rich fruit,
because the just person is rooted in the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       Jesus begins today’s Gospel passage by proclaiming a
just reward will be given to those who minister to anyone who has a
relationship with the Lord Jesus.  Following this, Jesus gives warning to those
who do anything to scandalize (literally, “put a stumbling block in the way
of”) the innocent.  Jesus also cautions His disciples about avoiding anything
that could cause them to sin.  Sources of possible sinfulness should be removed
so as to avoid the fires of Gehenna. [Gehenna is the Greek transliteration of
Ge Hinnom (The Valley of Hinnom) that was just southeast of Jerusalem.  In the
Valley of Hinnom, the people of Jerusalem burned their trash.  This dump site
was always burning and produced a vile smell.  It was often used as an image of
the punishment for the damned.]  Jesus ends today’s reading by speaking of two
elements that can be both painful and also useful:  salt and fire.  Just as
salt and fire are used in enhancing food and making them palatable, so GOD
sometimes purifies, preserves, and sanctifies us with going through rough times
so that our ministry can be more palatable in the mouths of those whom we are
called to serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       As I read the passages today, I realize how much I
still must grow in the ways of the Lord Jesus.  I have not always been radical
– radical in the ways of the Lord Jesus.  The words “radical” comes from the
Latin word, radix, radicis which means “root.”  I have not always sunk my roots
down deep into the Lord Jesus, trusting that GOD would provide everything I
really need.  I have been as vicious (full of vices) as some of the people who
were warned by the author of the Book of Sirach.  I have sought my value in
what I possess or in the honors I am given by others.  I have sometimes
presumed upon GOD’s unending mercy and so I have not striven to avoid certain
bad habits that lead to sins.  I figured, “Oh, GOD will forgive me!” and I have
not tried to sink my roots into the life-giving waters that flow from the cross
of Jesus.  I have been a scandal to the faith of certain individuals, putting
stumbling blocks in their paths of following the Lord Jesus.  I have not always
avoided “the near occasions of sin” but allowed myself to be in places where I
could be tempted to do wrong.  I have not been radical enough to completely
trust GOD and sink my roots in Jesus.  It is with increased prayer and reading
of the Word and sharing with other “radically” (deeply rooted) faith-filled
individuals that I can grow in relationship with the One Who is the
Master-Teacher.  As I continue to do that I will “know” the experience of the
individual in the words of today’s psalm, “Blessed is [the one] who. .
.delights in the law of the LORD and meditates on GOD’s law day and night.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What vices are
still present in my life that prevent me from being even more open to the flow
of GOD’s life-giving graces?  In what areas do I need to sink my roots more
deeply into the source of life that flows from the hands of GOD?  How can I
model my faith and reach out to others so that they can sense the benefits of
being rooted in GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of life-giving
growth, You call us to sink our roots deep within You.  Yet, we have often
sought to expand into areas that are not life-giving in the long run.  For the
times we have chosen to seek other values than Yours, we ask Your pardon and
peace.  Give us the strength and wisdom to follow the example of Your Son,
Jesus, Who is the Master-Teacher from Whom we can learn the importance of being
rooted in You.  Allow the life-giving graces that flow from the waters of the
Holy Spirit to touch the roots of our lives and give us the nourishment we need
to produce a rich harvest, no matter what stormy or dry conditions surrounds
us.  We give You thanks and praise, in and through Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, the Master-Teacher, Who is already living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you continue to develop and grow in healthy, true, and
blessed relationships, even when being a friend or concerned family members
demands a lot of you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pastor I know often says, “At the end of the day, what
really counts is relationships.”  How true that is.  Yet being in relationship
is difficult and risky, and at the same time, it is also so enriching and
joy-filled.   When we are a true friend or a beloved family member, it demands
we reach out beyond ourselves to the other.  This is also true in our
relationship with GOD.  We are called to look beyond ourselves to the One Who
loves us more than we could ever imagine.  It requires us to place ourselves in
GOD’s hands.  We are called to be people of the GOD of relationships.  We must
reach out and be touched by GOD and we must also touch the lives of others,
even though it may cost us all of what we have.  Yet if do, we will experience
a profound sense of what love truly is.​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Daniel Brottier:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 6: 5-17;         Psalm 119: 12, 16, 18,
27, 34, 35;         Mark 10: 1-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                               </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings today speak about relationships.  The
passage from Sirach describes what qualities to seek in a friend and the value
of a faithful friend.  The psalm speaks of the relationship that exists between
GOD and those who keep GOD’s commands.  In the Gospel, Jesus proclaims the
sanctity and permanence of a marital relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The First Reading today gives us powerful insights
into the value of friendship.  We may know a lot of people, but the number of
true friends will be limited because of that which binds true friends
together.  The binding force is not wealth or good times.  A faithful friend
will be there through GOoD times and bad times, especially when things get
rough, or disagreements happen.   A true friend is called “another self.”  The
passage urges care in whom one places one’s trust.  One should avoid placing
complete trust in mere passing acquaintances, but full confidence can be placed
in a true friend.  Having a relationship with a friend on whom one can trust is
a blessing from GOD.  And both will be in proper relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm refers to the relationship that flows from
obeying GOD’s precepts.  Obedience is much more than slavishly and strictly
following the exact letter of the law.  Obedience requires having a
relationship with GOD and seeking to do what GOD desires, not necessarily what
every human-made law demands.  Seeking the will of GOD builds upon the
relationship one has with the LORD and enhances the relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the Gospel, when confronted by His adversaries
about the permission to break a marriage relationship through divorce, Jesus
asks what scripture says about divorce.  Being people who knew GOD’s Word
verbatim, the religious leaders speak about Moses permitting divorce in
Deuteronomy 24: 1.  They knew that some of the later writings of the Hebrew
Scriptures stressed the sanctity of marital faithfulness (such as in Hosea). 
By quoting the older passages in the Torah (the first five books of the Bible
that are attributed to Moses), they were saying that Moses’ permitting divorce
is more “authentic” than the more “modern” writings.  Jesus remarks that Moses’
prescription in Deuteronomy were only Moses’ concession to the stubbornness and
the hardness of the hearts of those who could not keep GOD’s first precepts
concerning marriage.  Jesus goes back even further to the first book of the
Bible (Genesis), to the first few chapters, where GOD established a
relationship between Adam and Eve, that is, that a husband and wife are joined
together in a relationship established by GOD and no one is to separate what
GOD has put together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Relationships are a key part of religion.  In fact,
the word religion comes from the Latin re and ligio (“again” “binding” or
“re-establishing a relationship”).  Relationship is much more essential to GOD
than laws and regulations.  GOD desires that we be in relationship with one
another through friendships, with a spouse through marriage, and with GOD
through the faith covenant.  Relationship is the essence of GOD within the
Trinity itself.  GOD is the relationship between the Abba-Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit.  That relationship (which is Love) is what binds the three
persons of the Trinity to each other.  That love relationship is so powerful
that GOD wanted to share that loving relationship with all of creation,
especially with the climax of earthly creation, Adam and Eve, the “first
humans.”  GOD created Adam and Eve in the divine image.  Part of the image of
GOD placed within humans is the capability of being in relationship.  GOD
united Adam and Eve in a loving relationship so that they could reflect the
love relationship that exists within GOD.  Since GOD has created and blessed
and given part of the divine relationship of love to the union of husband and
wife, that union that comes from GOD is meant to be never ending, just as the
relationship between the Abba, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is unending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Another type of relationship that reflects the loving
relationship of GOD is the bond of true friendship.  Jesus gave the example of
what that friendship relationship was all about both in His Word and His action. 
Jesus said, “No greater love does anyone have than to lay down one’s life for a
friend” (John 15:13).  Jesus did that very thing when He died on the cross for
His friends, including us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I am reminded of the song “What a Friend We Have in
Jesus.”  Jesus has demonstrated the type of friend relationship He has with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      My response to all of this is to look at the
relationships that I have in my life:  my relationship to my friends, my
relationship to my family, and most importantly, the relationship I have with
GOD.  I must commit myself to re-ligio – binding myself again to my friends, my
family, and my GOD.  In that sense, religion must be a continuous activity.  I
must keep on re-committing myself to what unites me with others.  I must be willing,
like Jesus, to lay down my life for others. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Having relationships is part of what makes us become
reflections of the essence of GOD.  Relationships can be one of the most trying
aspects of being human and also one of the most blessed and joyful parts of
being human.  Relationships leave us open to being hurt, vulnerable to the
rejection by the other (except rejection by GOD), and it also enriches our
lives in ways that could never be, without having a deep connection with
another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I thought about this when I was called upon by a
hospitalized friend to repeatedly go out of my way (emotionally, with time, and
physically) to meet the friend’s need while the friend was hospitalized.  I
realized that I had to commit myself to doing what the friend needed to have
done, even if it was inconvenient for me.  And I had to do it with the mind of
Jesus – that of being a joyful servant.  It may not have been what I would do
for happiness, but I did it with joy, for I knew it was what GOD would have me
do.  It was in doing so that I could resonate with the psalmist today and say,
“Lead me in the path of Your commands, for in it I delight.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What relationships
in my life are most important?  What do I do to enhance the relationship(s)? 
What is the most challenging aspect of being in relationship?  What is the most
joy-filled part of being in relationship?  What can I do today to enhance my
relationship with an acquaintance?  With a family member?  With GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever faithful and desirous
of being in relationship not only within Yourself, but also with us.  Through
Your GOoDness, You invite us to be people of relationships.  You call us to
re-ligio – to bind ourselves again – to You, to our loved ones, and to those
whom You have placed along our paths.  We have not always wanted to be
committed to a relationship, for it demands a lot of us.  Yet in making the
decision to be with, and for others, You draw us into a closer bond with You.  May
we follow the example of Your Son and be willing to lay down our lives for
others, for our family, and for You.  For it is in being willing to do so that
we will experience the fullness of life eternally with You.  We make this
prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher and our
Friend, Who continues to guides us through the workings of the Holy Spirit, and
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you confidently proclaim that you are a member of the
family of GOD and treat others as your sisters and brothers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been blessed to have had loving parents and a brother
and also to have a very close relationship with other family members.  To be
part of a loving family is truly awesome.  Yet there are times when I have been
tempted to pretend that I was not related to them.  It might have been when I
did something wrong and I didn’t want someone to say to me, “That’s not what I
expected of you.  You are not acting like a member of our family.”  Or it might
have been when another member of my family was embarrassed to let others know
that we were related.  Yet, most of the time, the members of my family are
proud to say that we are related and that we love one another.  The bonds that
have existed and still exist between us are so strong that I can only say,
“thank You, GOD.”  That feeling struck me eight years ago when I attended
Alumni Day at our school and two of my family members spoke to the Middle
School students.  I was on the verge of tears of joy as I heard them speak so
eloquently and proudly as alumni of the school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can say that also about being part of the family of GOD,
having so loving a Divine Parent and Brother and also many other sisters and
brothers who continue to demonstrate our GODly Family’s loving
characteristics.​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint David of Wales</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 17: 1-15;          Psalm 103: 13-14,
15-16, 17-18;               Mark 10: 13-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       Once again, the readings focus on relationships.  The
First Reading is a summary of the relationship that GOD has established with
humankind.  The psalm compares GOD to a loving and compassionate parent who
cares for children.  In the Gospel, Jesus demonstrates His love for children,
going so far as to say that unless we who are adults have the simple, complete
faith of a child, we will not be a part of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       The author of the Book of Sirach reviews the
relationship that GOD has with humankind.  It began at creation, continued
through multiple covenants that created a binding connection between GOD and
mortals again and again (re ligio - “to bind again”).  GOD has given the Divine
Spirit to humans and filled them with wisdom.  GOD has placed humans over the
rest of creation as caretakers.  GOD has revealed the divine glory to mortals
so that they could begin to realize how much GOD loves and cares for them and
so that they would give glory and praise back to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       The psalmist is moved by the love that GOD has for
the Chosen People whenever the psalmist looks at the love and compassion human
parents have for their children.  The LORD obviously knows those who have come
from GOD better than human parents know their own offspring.  GOD has
established a covenant relationship with the Chosen People, and GOD will never
go back on the promises made, GOD will not forget the bond that exists between
humankind and the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       In the Gospel, Jesus chides His disciples for keeping
children away from Him.   Jesus gathers the children around Him and tells His
followers that they must have the same kind of faith and trust in Him as the
children do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       I remember when certain members of our family were in
the primary grades at the school where I taught.  Whenever they saw me on
campus, they would run up to me and give me a big hug.  They were not afraid to
demonstrate their love for me.  In fact, they seemed proud that I was their
relative and that I was working at the same school where they were students. 
They were acting in a way that seemed to say to the other kids, “See this is a
member of my family and he loves me so much.”  They not only did not care what
the other kids thought about their relationship with me, but also, they were
almost boasting to the other children about their relationship with me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       That reminded me of the faith that Jesus spoke about
when He said in today’s Gospel, “Let the children come to Me; do not prevent
them, for the Reign of GOD belongs to such as these.  Amen, I say to you,
whoever does not accept the Reign of GOD like a child will not enter it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       We must be bold and demonstrative of our faith
relationship with the Lord Jesus.  We should not fear what others might think
of us.  We must stand up for our relationship with GOD and even boast about it,
not in a sarcastic way or with an air of superiority, but in a bold,
faith-filled, and loving way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       Yet many times, we seem almost embarrassed about our
faith and our relationship with the Lord Jesus.  We act more like some
teenagers who are reluctant to show any connection with their family members. 
They do not want anyone to know who their relatives are. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       As a child of GOD, I feel challenged to be more
demonstrative concerning my relationship with GOD.  GOD has loved me and has
had (and still has) compassion for me.  GOD not only created me in the divine
image, but has given me the Divine Word, both in the Bible, and in the person
of the Word Incarnate.  It is in Jesus that I have been offered the gift of
salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) which really means a deeper, everlasting
relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, in the unity of the Holy
Spirit.  GOD has loved me even with all my sinfulness.  Like a young child who
knows no limit to the way of demonstrating love for a parent, I must be willing
to boldly, proudly, and completely show how much I appreciate the relationship
I have with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I
demonstrate that I am proud to be in relationship with GOD?  Do people know Who
my Abba and my Brother are by the way I live my life?  Do they see any family
resemblance in me that points back to Whose family I belong?  What can I do to
more boldly, proudly, and completely show how much I appreciate my relationship
with GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>       Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving parent and
provider, You have made us in Your own divine image and given us a share in
Your life.  Yet, as disobedient children, we have often ignored and even at
times refused Your love, choosing to go our separate way, denying our
connection with You.  But as a patient and long-suffering Parent Who You are,
You wait for us to come to our senses and return to You, seeking the
forgiveness that Your Son has gained for us through His life, death, and
resurrection.  Continue to fill us with Your Holy Spirit of wisdom and
understanding, courage and strength, so that we can openly profess our
relationship with You and do all we can to bring ourselves and others closer to
You.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the
One Who has opened the door to Your home so that we can someday be with You in
Your heavenly palace where Jesus is now living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>​May you continue to reflect on your motives for speaking
and actions, and may that lead you to say and do what GOD intends for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my experience, many people talk and act without thinking
things through.  It is much easier to just react than to weigh the consequences
of our words and deeds.  It takes effort on our part to reflect on what GOD
would have us do.  If we seek to proclaim the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus, we
must be willing to act like Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Agnes of Bohemia:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 27: 4-7                              Psalm
92: 2-3, 13-14, 15-16;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 1 Corinthians 15: 54-58;               Luke
6: 39-45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I came across a quote from Benjamin Franklin that
summarizes the readings for today:  “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but
the mouth of a wise man is in heart.”  The passage from Sirach reminds us that
what comes out of the mouth gives us a clue to what a person thinks and feels. 
The First Reading also uses the analogy of the fruit produced by a tree is an
indication of care that is taken of the tree.  Paralleling this second image,
the Responsorial proclaims that GOoD fruit produced by a tree is like person
who is in a relationship with GOD.  In the Second Reading, St. Paul reminds the
believers in Corinth (and us today) that they (and we) must be devoted to the
GOoD works of the Lord Jesus.  In the Gospel, Jesus also challenges His
listeners to be the GOoD fruit by positively looking at oneself and seeing
where one can improve and also speaking from a caring and loving heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Sirach is one of the Wisdom Books and was written in
the early Second Century before the coming of Jesus.  It used many literary
tools to link wisdom, faith, and religious practices.  It is not part of the
Protestant Old Testament books, but it has been part of the canonical books of
the Catholic Church.  Today’s reading gives us a look into the importance of
living out one’s faith by realizing the effect our words and action have on
others and how our words give others a glimpse of who we really are and what is
important in our lives.  It uses the analogy of what is produced by a healthy
tree.  We probably call to mind the words, “By their fruit, you will know them”
(cf. Matthew 7: 16-20).  Thus, the author is reminding his readers and us that
a person’s words are an indication of the person’s attitude and orientation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Responsorial uses a similar image of palm and
cedar trees growing in the house of the LORD, bearing fruit.  These trees
produce and grow well.  The allusion of being “planted in the house of the
LORD” and “flourishing in the courts of our GOD” can refer to being grounded
and rooted in GOD and thus having GOoD growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In today’s Second Reading, St. Paul tells the people
of Corinth that even if they face trying times, if they remain unwavering in
their faith as they do the work that GOD has given to them, then their work
will be fruitful.  As we have read over the past few Sundays, Paul wants the
believers then (and now) to focus not on themselves but on edifying and
building up the Church, the Body or Christ.  Paul has already told them that
their gifts (charismata) are for the GOoD of all believers and the greatest
gift is that of agape (unconditional love for others).  In the selection for
today, he goes on to say that if they use the gifts, especially agape-love,
they will be clothed with immortality – eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The Gospel today has three parts:  1) an analogy
speaking about the need for an “insightful” teacher rather than a mere fellow,
blind traveler along the road of faith; 2) a challenge to examine one’s one life
before criticizing others (using the analog of a person with a plank of wood in
her/his eyes, trying to remove a splinter from another person’s eye); and 3) a
reminder that we can only produce GOoD fruit if we act out of the GOoDness of
our whole being.  Jesus is challenging His disciples (past and present) to
strive to be GOoD by reflecting on their lives and seeing how they can improve
and bear the GOoDness that GOD has given them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      What strikes me in today’s readings is the need to
consciously look at our relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit.  As we do that, we need to focus on what GOoD
gifts GOD has bestowed on us and how we have used those gifts for not only our
betterment, but also for the betterment of others.  That takes work, diligently
searching our own lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Too many people speak and act without contemplating
how their words and behavior affect others.  Or, if they do think about what
they say and do, they don’t realize that they are motivated by selfish pursuits
and interests rather than seeking to assist others by lovingly serving them. 
Faith in action takes a consciousness on our part.  We must be aware of how GOD
has blessed us.  Then we must use those blessings to edify and build up others
so they can realize the love that GOD has for them.  Yet so often we act and
speak out of foolish ways, rather than wisely looking to where our heart is and
correcting any errors in our approach to living out our faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I sometimes
speak without taking the time to reflect on my motives?  Are my words and
actions in reference to others motivated by selfish desires or truly loving concern
for their edification?  What further steps should I take to examine my words
and actions and see if they are producing GOoD fruit?  What can I do to enrich
the life and growth of others this week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all that is GOoD.  You
continue to bless us with opportunities for growth by giving us gifts that we
use in our service of others.  Yet, we have often focused only on our desires
and failed to see how we can reach out to others and work for their
betterment.  Forgive us for the times we have spoken and acted without fully
reflecting on what You would have us say and do.  Help us to look to Jesus,
Your Son, our Master-Teacher, and follow His example of loving service. 
Continue to gift us with the wisdom that comes from Your Holy Spirit so that we
can be the persons You want us to be.  To You we lift up this prayer of praise
and thanksgiving, in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD for
ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you realize what richness you already have and be
willing to share that with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Riches are not just the acquired wealth or investments in
land or items which we have.  Riches are those values that we hold dearly.  If
our riches are not “of the Lord,” then those other riches prevent us from
deepening our relationship with GOD and with others.  Any values that take us
away from being in touch with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, and with
others, those values are “addictions” – things to which we become physically or
emotionally attached and prevent us from doing GOD’s will.  We must be willing
to let go of all the riches that hinder us from being who GOD wants us to be. 
The only true riches are those that come from the Lord Jesus and enable us to
lovingly serve our GOD as we tend to the needs of others.​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Katharine
Drexel                                                                                          
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:    Sirach 17: 20-29;       Psalm 32: 1-2,  5, 6,
7;         Mark 10: 17-27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings seem to be preparing us for Lent which
begins in two days.  The scripture passages for this day challenge us to take
seriously our faith relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father.  Part
of that relationship demands that we turn from sin (Sirach and Responsorial
Psalm) and be willing to become a disciplined follower of the Lord Jesus
(Gospel).  Thus, our relationship with GOD is more than intellectual agreement
to certain truths, it demands a commitment to GOD from our whole being (mind,
heart, soul, and body).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The reading from Sirach seems to remind us that
repentance is something on which we focus during Lent, but also all year long. 
We are asked to turn away from sin and turn back to GOD.  If we come into GOD’s
presence seeking GOD’s forgiveness, GOD will bring a sense of hope. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The psalm also focuses on the forgiveness of GOD,
reminding those who hear these sacred words that they can have their sins
forgiven and should rejoice in being drawn into a closer relationship with the
LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the Gospel, Jesus points out to His disciples that
one of the lures that takes us away from GOD is the desire for possessions.  It
is only when we are willing to forsake all that hinders us from following Jesus
that we can experience the fullness of the riches of the Reign of GOD.  The
willingness to renounce our belongings is the first step for some in completely
following the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings challenge me to look at my lifestyle.  I
must be willing to die to my old, sinful selfishness in order to celebrate the
new life that is promised by Jesus’ resurrection.  The more I am willing to
reject my sinful ways and remove any hindrances to following Jesus, the more I
will be able to be one with the Risen Lord.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings give us some practical advice.  We must
admit our sinfulness to GOD, and we need to seek GOD’s pardon and forgiveness. 
That will bring us a new sense of joy.  Sin is “missing the mark” – the mark of
being right on target with GOD.  Sin is not just those times when we have
consciously chosen to aim in a direction diametrically opposed to GOD (a theos)
and therefore are mortally killing our relationship with God.  Sin is also the
little things that prevent us from hitting the center of our aim (GOD). Thus,
those little things (as compared to mortal sins) are venial sins.   It can be
our own miscalculations or lack of strength which cause us to veer slightly off
the straight and narrow path to GOD.  We must honestly present our sins to the
Lord Jesus, and we must ask for GOD’s healing (forgiveness) of those sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Yet, admitting our sins also includes looking at our
lives and seeing to what “riches” we still cling.  “Riches” are not just money
or possessions.  “Riches” are those aspects of our lives that have so much
importance to us that we do not want to let them go fully.  They are those
things that prevent us from completely being a disciple of the Lord Jesus.  It
can be some “addictions” we have, such as overly “rich” food, excessive
drinking (and I am not referring to just alcohol drinks – some people are
hooked on soda), television watching, Internet usage, over-indulgent
self-pleasure.  The key thing about an addiction is it is something that
controls our lives and does not allow us to give ourselves fully to the Lord
Jesus.  When we think about “riches” this way, it is no wonder that the
disciples of Jesus in today’s Gospel respond the way they do when Jesus
explains how hard it is for a “rich” person to get into Reign of Heaven.  The
disciples ask, “Well, then who can be saved?”  We all have riches (addictions)
that take hold of our lives.  In and of ourselves, there is no human way to let
go of our “riches.”  Yet, Jesus gives us the only way out of our addiction to
whatever “riches” control our lives.  He says, “For mortals it is impossible,
but not for GOD.  For GOD, all things are possible.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Let us spend time looking honestly at our lives.  Let
us seek GOD’s forgiveness for our sins.  Not only can we ask GOD to bring us
pardon, but also, we can, and should, ask GOD to give us the strength to let go
of those “riches” that prevent us from completely following the Lord Jesus. 
And then we will be able to rejoice with the words of the psalmist today and
say, “Happy are those whose sins are forgiven. . .You (, LORD,) preserve me
from trouble; You surround me with glad cries of deliverance!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  To what “riches” do
I cling, thus preventing me from fully experiencing the richness of the Reign
of GOD in my life?  How can I let go of those “riches” and be more open to the
GOoD News of the Lord Jesus?  Can my letting go of “riches” allow me to be more
giving to those who need my assistance?  What can I do today to enhance the
lives of another person with the richness of the Reign of GOD?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever forgiving and
all-powerful.  Through Your GOoDness, You have made us realize our struggle in
following You and committing our lives to You.  We are so easily distracted by
false lures of temporary pleasure and passing wealth that we fail to see the
fullness of the riches You have in store for us in the completeness of Your
Reign.  We have at times “missed the mark” and sinned, turning fully or
partially away from You.  We seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  We have
surrounded ourselves with earthly “riches” that have prevented us from fully
following You and Your Son, Jesus.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, give
us strength and make it possible for us to be true followers and disciples of
Your Son.  Fill us with the joy of Your riches and move us to continually and
perpetually give You thanks and praise.  We make this prayer in and through
Your Son, Jesus, Who is our Brother and Master-Teacher, and Who temporarily was
willing to give up the riches of Your Reign in heaven, in order to give us an
example of letting go of our riches, so that we could one day experiences the
fullness of Your luxurious Reign.  It is He Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.    <a

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=Mar4></a>Mar. 04. 2025 - Tue. of 8th Week in Ord.
Time    <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May you seek to deepen your relationship with the Lord Jesus
and with others by being willing to spend time with those with whom you have a
relationship and not just by performing actions that fulfill requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an educator, my desire has always been that the students
develop a love for learning and a desire to explore information, in the process
of bettering themselves and those around them.  I have been frustrated when
those whom I am instructing say such things as, “Will this be on the test?”  or
“What do I have to do to earn an ‘A’ in the class?”  They are concerned only in
what is the minimal requirements they have to fulfill in order to get a
positive grade.  They are not interested in learning and growing so that they
can be better, more well-rounded individuals.  They see the immediate concern
is to do well in the class in order to obtain a positive grade.  The fact that
they might find the process of learning and developing relationship, which
could enhance their future life and be a source of helping others, is not what
they see as important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants us to grow and learn from life experiences and
become better individuals and develop a relationship with the Lord Jesus and
with others.  We have been given rules and commandments not as hoops we must
jump through, but to help us become who GOD wants us to be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Happy “Fat Tuesday” or as they say in French, “Mardi Gras”! 
Tomorrow is the beginning of Lent with Ash Wednesday.​</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Casimir:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 35: 1-12;              Psalm 50: 5-6, 7-8,
14 and 23;           Mark 10: 28-31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Our readings remind us that almsgiving and charitable
acts are to be practiced as a response to what GOD has already done for us. 
Our First Reading and Responsorial Psalm speak about the importance of offering
to GOD a sacrifice of loving service rather than ritualistic offerings.  In the
Gospel, the disciples question Jesus about their “reward” for giving up some of
their former ways of life and following Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The author of the Book of Sirach praises the life of
those who act with justice and charity.  Caring for others, giving to the poor,
treating people properly is more pleasing to GOD than animal sacrifices. 
Offering animals to GOD is not as demanding of the person as are continual
actions of loving others.  Charity is actually more reflective of a person’s
mind set than giving money so an animal can be killed and offered to GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      In the Gospel, after Peter asks Jesus about how he and
the other disciples will benefit from their giving up family and jobs to follow
Him, Jesus promises to bless them and multiply what they have given up by
giving them more in this life.  He also promises some other fringe benefits of
being His disciples:  persecution and eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      As I reflect on the readings, I realized how much of a
cop-out it can be for people to just do things ritualistically.  It does not
necessarily demand much of them as individuals.  Being kind, generous,
thoughtful to others is much more challenging than following some external
ceremony.  Acting in a just and caring way is not limited to the hour of
sacrifice, but it is an all day and all-night activity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      I was reminded of a comparison a while ago when
individuals were giving gifts on a certain occasion in a person’s life.  Most
people who gave gifts were not sure what to give the honoree.  It was easier
for them to give generic gifts, such as money or gift cards.  Yet a few
individuals took the time to thoughtfully consider who their friend was and
what was special to the receiver, and then they gave an appropriate gift.  It
took more of those who went out of their way to select the special gift that
was personal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      As members of the Body of Christ, we are asked to
think about ways we can personalize our relationship with the Lord Jesus by
reaching out to the other members of the Body of Christ.  The Church lifts up
the value of the acts of charity, self-deprivation, and times of prayer.  And
we will hear more about this tomorrow (Ash Wednesday) and throughout the Lenten
season.  It takes more work on our part to think about what I should cut out of
my life in order to enable me to give more to others and grow in my
relationship with GOD (which is what prayer is all about).  I can’t just say,
“I went to church and gave my donation on Sunday, so that takes care of my ‘caring
service’ for the week.”  It is much more difficult to look at my life and
realize that I have to empty myself of certain bad habits and practices, and I
need to see what I can do to be more giving of my time, talent, and treasure to
those who are in need of my help.  It is more demonstrative of my relationship
with the Lord Jesus to focus on the relationships I have gained by my time with
the Master-Teacher through reading His Word, listening and talking to Him, and
reaching out and loving others as He has loved me. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      The readings speak about the fact that GOD will re-pay
us for what we do.  That should not be why we do what we do, but it should be a
bonus we receive.  The main purpose of our actions at all times should be to
give glory to GOD and to give witness to the loving care that the Lord Jesus
has already shown to us.  That is why we should seek to draw closer to Jesus
and act lovingly towards others.  That should be the sacrifice we offer to GOD,
or as GOD says in the psalm:  “Offer to GOD praise as your sacrifice and
fulfill your vows to the Most High.  The one who offers praise as a sacrifice
glorifies Me; and to the one who goes the right way I will show the salvation
of GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What has been my
attitude toward offering GOD praise as my sacrifice?  Do I try to jump through
the right hoops, hoping that GOD will reward me for my doing it right?  Or do I
seek to deepen my relationships with the Lord Jesus and others because GOD has
already blessed me with those relationships?  What can I do to help bring the
love of GOD to someone today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>      Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and kind. 
Through Your GOoDness, Your continual remind us of our relationship with You. 
You deserve all our sacrifices and all our praise.  Repeatedly You have told us
that You desire the sacrifice of our praise in living loving and caring lives
as disciples of Your Son, Jesus.  He has asked us to love one another as He has
loved us.  Yet, human as we are, we have wanted to jump through certain hoops
to say that we have fulfilled the requirements.  We have wanted to say, “Yes, I
did all things I was supposed to do, I checked off all the things I was
supposed to do.  Where is my reward?”  You seek not the results of our doings,
but a relationship with You and through You and Your Son, relationships with
Your other adopted daughters and sons.  For the times we have missed out on
being with You and others because we thought we had to be doing, we ask for
Your forgiveness and healing.  Help us to focus on what will enhance our
relationship with You and with our brothers and sisters.  May we lovingly and
freely choose to empty ourselves of those things that hinder the deepening of
those relationships.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, empower us to be
generous with all that You have given to us.  We lift up this prayer of praise
and honor to You, in and through Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and our
Brother, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.    <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Joseph of the Cross: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Joel 2: 12-18; Psalm 51: 3-4, 5-6, 12-13, 14, 17;
2 Corinthians 5: 20 - 6: 2; Matthew 6: 1-6, 16-18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading is a call to repentance (μετάνοια -
metanoia). All the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people are asked to return to the LORD and seek forgiveness
for their sins and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>practice acts of mortification: fasting and refraining from
pleasurable acts. They</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are to ask GOD to spare GOD’s holy people from the
punishment that they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>deserve for their sinfulness. And GOD relents from punishing
the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm builds on this theme of repentance with the
refrain: “Be merciful,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O LORD, for we have sinned.” It, too, is a plea to GOD to
look beyond the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinfulness of the past and to bring a new, clean heart to
the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his Second Letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul tells the
people to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciled with GOD. He reminds them that now is the time –
now is the day of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our Gospel today, Jesus speaks of three signs of a change
of heart (metanoia): almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. He also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>warns that these penitential acts must not be done ostentatiously
(to show off), but must be done privately so only GOD is aware of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the deeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, we are beginning the great penitential season of the
Church Year – Lent. Lent comes from an old English word, lencten,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that means “lengthening” of daylight or “springtime.” In
medieval England, Spring began on February 7. Even though we are over</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a month away from the modern season of Spring, we are called
to look from the deadness of winter to the new life of spring. Yet,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to get to the new life, we must be willing to go through
mortification – a certain dying to self. And the reason for this mortification</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is because we are sinful people. We have not always had GOD
as our focus, and we have not always been aiming toward GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings speak of ways of changing our directions
(metanoia or repentance). It should be both a community response</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(First Reading) and an individual response (Gospel). We need
to acknowledge our sinfulness, our missing the mark, our being a- theos (away
from GOD). We also need to ask GOD to help us to re-orient ourselves to being
ad-Deum (toward GOD). And we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are reminded that now is the time to spend our energy and
efforts on this change of direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is Ash Wednesday, a day when we are marked with an
ashen cross on our foreheads to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>remind us to be people who live by the cross, individuals
who are but ashes in the overall picture,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but persons who can make a difference if we align ourselves
with the all-mighty and ever-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiving GOD. Ashes have been a sign of repentance for many
millennia. They signify our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>insignificance and our ultimate destiny without GOD –
returning to the dust of the earth as ashes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from fires used to be spread on the land. With GOD, however,
there is a chance for new life,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fuller life, eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what does all this mean for us in a practical way? We
are called to look at our lives and see</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>where we are headed, not just in our daily living, but also
in the ultimate view of the world. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need to look at our relationship with GOD and with others
and see where we have missed the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mark (sinned), and what we must do to get back on target (ad
Deum - toward GOD). And this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whole process must be done, but not in showy way so that
people will say: “Oh, look, at that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>person, they are doing penance.” We must put into practice
the acts of mortification spoken of in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>today’s Gospel: almsgiving, prayer, and fasting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Almsgiving should be more than just</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>giving money to a charitable organization,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>such as to those who people who are experiencing financial
difficulties or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>suffering from disasters or illnesses, or from military or
terrorist attacks. It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should be a giving of our time, talent, and treasure to
furthering the Gospel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(GOoD News) of Jesus the Christ. A pastor speaks about “not
giving to a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need, but rather our having a need to give.” We all need to
give of ourselves, just</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as Jesus gave of Himself during His earthly existence. He
did not have to give</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Himself. He freely chose to give of Himself, to leave His
rightful place in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heaven, to become human like us, and to give His life on the
cross – for us. And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we need to give of ourselves in a similar manner, and it
needs to be done in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cheerful and joyful manner (2 Cor. 9: 7), not causing people
to take note of us,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but in a way of which only GOD is aware. Almsgiving is the
unconditional</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>giving of ourselves to better and edify ourselves and
others. It means that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other people are more important than our things, our
possessions. It is as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>much an attitude of our minds as an action of our living. Or
better put, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>attitude of our mids should flow into our action of giving.
Thus, in a parish I know, they talk about G.R.A.C.E., that is Gracious Response
According to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christ’s Embrace. We have been graced by GOD, Jesus has
embraced us, and so we need to graciously respond to what the Lord Jesus, His
Abba-Father, and the Holy Spirit have done for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prayer is the way we relate to GOD. We must do ACTS. We are
called to Adore GOD, acknowledge GOD for all of Who GOD is. We must be Contrite
– recognizing who we are in GOD’s sight – sinful, less than we could be, in
need of GOD’s help. We must be people of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanksgiving who proclaim our gratefulness to GOD for all
GOD has done, is doing, and will continue to do in our lives. We must be people
of Supplication – asking GOD’s help for others and for ourselves. Prayer is not
just words we say, it is our attitude about GOD – our relationship with GOD. It
is not just something we do an hour on Sunday and before meals, it is who we
are at every moment of every day, in our relationship with GOD and with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fasting is doing without. It is not just doing without food;
it is the emptying of ourselves of all that is blocking our focusing on GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We do without, so that we can be filled with GOD and with
gifts from GOD. It is looking at what we have, and realizing that what we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have (possessions, food, habits) may be preventing us from
being in touch with our GOD, at least as fully as we can be. And it also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>implies that as we empty ourselves of those possessions,
attitudes, and values to which we cling, we also must open ourselves and let</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD fill us with what we truly need to be faithful disciples
of the Lord Jesus. Let go – and let GOD!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what can I (and you) do for Lent? I am going to work on
one thing each day of Lent. I am consciously going to choose how I might</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>focus more on GOD each day. For example, I will see what is
something I value, and see how I might share that with at least one other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>person. That is almsgiving, sharing something I value with
another. One day it might be money. I might try to give to some charity. It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>might be donating blood to a blood bank. On another day, it
could be my time. I might share some of my time with someone who needs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me, even if it is only done virtually online. Another day, I
will see how I might be more aware of GOD in my life. It may mean I will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>turn off my favorite television show, and I will spend time
reading scripture or a spiritual book. It may mean I stop some of my regular</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>activities and just sit in the presence of GOD. It may mean
I think of someone who is going through a rough time and spend time lifting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that person up in my prayer time with GOD or spending time
with him/her by whatever means available to me and that person. Another</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>day, I might fast from doing something I like, for example
searching the Internet for interesting information, and instead I will write a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>letter to someone with whom I have been meaning to
correspond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My Lenten journey will be filled with concentrated,
short-term acts of almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. I might write them down in
a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>journal, so that at Easter, I can look back and see where I
have been going on my Lenten travels. Not in the sense of saying that I did a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD job, but to see where I have grown in my relationship
with GOD and my interaction with others. I might also share my Lenten</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experiences with one other person, a spiritual advisor or
friend, so that the other person can help me to travel along with the Lord
Jesus as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I go through Lent. This other person will encourage me and
challenge me so that I stay focused on the Lord Jesus and by becoming a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more faithful disciple (disciplined learner) of the
Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lent is a special time in which we can dedicate ourselves to
looking at who we are in GOD’s sight and getting back on target. It is a time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of dying with Christ, putting to death anything that is not
helping me draw closer to GOD. It is a “springtime” of renewal so we really</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will be able to celebrate the new life of the Risen Lord on
Easter. And now is the time that is being lent to us as a new “springtime” and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“lengthening” of day with the Lord Jesus and His sisters and
brothers, in order to put ourselves on this journey of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How am I going to
make Lent a time of drawing closer to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus? What forms of almsgiving can I perform besides
just giving money? From what can I fast so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that I will have time to be with the Lord Jesus and be
filled with the blessings that GOD has in store for me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In what extra ways will I spend time in prayer during Lent?
How can I help others have a more spiritual</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience of Lent this year?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, almighty and ever-forgiving,
willing to relent the punishment we deserve for our sins, if we but turn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to You. Through Your GOoDness, You desire that we draw
closer to You through this Lenten season. You call us to honestly look at our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lives and see what it is that blocks us from fully following
Your Son as He leads us to a closer relationship with Him and with You, in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>union of the Holy Spirit. Help us to repent of our sins,
turn our lives more fully towards You. You ask us to participate in the
suffering</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and death of Your Son, Jesus, as we die to ourselves through
acts of almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. Help us to stay focused so that at</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the end of this Lent, we will be able to share in the
newness of life that comes from the Risen Lord. We make this prayer through
Jesus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Son, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who has gone
before us in His suffering and death, and Who is the Resurrection and New</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life, and Who is living and reigning with You, and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Mary Ann of Jesus of Paredes:
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-mary-ann-of-jesus-of-paredes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Deuteronomy 30: 15-20; Psalm 1: 1-2, 3, 4 and 6;
Luke 9: 22-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind us that GOD is presenting us with
choices. In the First</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading, GOD lays out the two choices that the Israelites
have: life with GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through obedience to GOD’s precepts, or death through
disobedience. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Responsorial Psalm proclaims that those who walk in the way
of the LORD are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>truly blessed for they have a source of life from the Author
of all life. In the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel, Jesus invites His disciples to freely follow Him in
order to experience</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life, even in the midst of suffering and death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Moses draws close to the Promised Land that he knows he
will not enter,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he gives the Israelites a simple choice: life or death. Life
comes from being in a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with GOD, death flows from turning one’s back
on GOD. When</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presented with such a choice it seems hard to believe that
people would choose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the path to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm compares those who place their trust
in the LORD to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a tree that is planted near running water. Such a tree is
able to sink its roots deep</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>down and draw moisture from the aquifer even in dry seasons.
So those who are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rooted in the LORD draw life- sustaining power from the LORD
when the dry and barren times come in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus informs His disciples that His mission</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>includes suffering and death at the hands of others. In
union with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Him, those who wish to be His followers must be willing to
suffer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and die in order to have real life. The choice is laid out
before them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They (and we) must make the sometimes (in the short run)
painful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>decision to follow the Lord Jesus and, therefore, experience
joyful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life that will last forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these readings, I am reminded that I have
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>same choice: life or death. True life is life with GOD
forever. Yet it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>comes as a result of being willing to die to self so as to
live for GOD. This season of Lent allows us to see what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aspects of our lives need to die – those items or parts that
prevent us from completely following the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Acts of self-denial and generously giving help to others are
two ways to rid our lives of the unnecessary parts of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our life, so we can then focus on being true disciples of
the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can remember as a child that it was suggested to me to
“give up” things during Lent. Some of the things that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I gave up were sweets, desserts, and/or going to the movies.
Making these “sacrifices” did help me to focus on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sacrifices Jesus made for me. That’s what I thought was the
reason I was asked to “give up” my favorite things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet there is even more to it than experiencing deprivation
so we can think about the sacrifices Jesus made for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are called to empty ourselves not just of our favorite
things, but also of those things that can prevent us from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>completely following the Lord Jesus. That can include our
addictions (even minor ones to television, or the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Internet, or major ones to alcohol, drugs, illicit
relationships), our negative attitudes toward others, our pride, our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seeking to be something that may seem important, but that
actually distracts us from deepening our relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD and with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a great time to also perform positive actions to
improve our relationships with GOD and others. It can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>include spending more time in prayer, reading scripture and
other religious texts (rather than watching television),</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>listening to recordings or Christian music that will help me
focus on GOD’s life with me (rather than listening to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the “regular” radio as it promotes values other than GODly
ones). I personally use YouTube and choose Lenten</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>music.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lent should be a working retreat – a time to continue the
essential and required part of our lives (such as work,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>school, and relationship with others) – but also a time of
withdrawing from our regular routine, at least those parts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of our routine that may not be totally GOD-centered. It
means going out into the “desert” place in our lives,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>putting aside the non-essential activities, and spending
more time in developing our relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can also be a time to develop our human relationships
with those whom GOD has placed in our lives. So</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>often, we do not really invest time and energy in our
dealings with other people. We expect others to be attentive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to us, but we do not pay much attention to them. Lent is a
GOoD time to see how we relate more to others. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can mortify (die to) ourselves by being more life-giving and
life-sustaining to those we encounter regularly and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>even those we encounter only occasionally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we can spend less time and energy on ourselves and more
time and energy on our relationships with GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and others, then we will be disciples of the Lord Jesus
because we will be manifesting our decision to choose life –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>eternal life with GOD – rather than the death that comes
with mere human existence focusing on ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The choice is yours and mine. You and I can make these forty
days a time of renewal and dedication to life, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>just a time of sticking with the status quo and not growing
in the Lord Jesus. I join with Moses in today’s First</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading and urge you to “choose life, then, that you and
your descendants may live, by loving the LORD, your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, heeding GOD’s voice, and holding fast to the LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What plans have I
made to make this Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a time of a working “spiritual retreat”? What things do I
need to “give up” in order to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>empty myself of my selfishness and open myself more fully to
GOD? What negative</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aspects of my interrelating with others need to die, so that
I can celebrate the life of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other people with whom I come in contact? How can I help
others think about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>choosing life (eternal life with GOD) rather than the mere
death that comes at the end</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of our time on earth?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever desirous of giving us life.
Through Your GOoDness, You want us to freely</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>choose life with You. You have given us free will to make
decisions. You know what is best for us and You have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presented the options before us, but You want us to show our
desire to be with You by acting in a way that may be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>challenging, but that will ultimately result in life with You.
We often get sidetracked and choose temporary and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seemingly apparent “goods,” but they lead us away from You.
For those times we have made wrong choices and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinned, we ask for Your pardon and forgiveness. Through the
power and inspiration of Your Holy Spirit, give us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the strength to follow the lead of Your Son, Jesus, Who
calls us to be His disciples. We make this prayer through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who has
gone before us in His suffering and death, and Who is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Resurrection and New Life, and Who is living and
reigning with You, and the Holy Spirit, our one and only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, forever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Optional Memorial of Saints Felicitas and Perpetua)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Perpetua and Felicity:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 58: 1-9a; Psalm 51: 3-4, 5-6, 18-19;
Matthew 9: 14-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the theme, and even the readings, sounds familiar, they
are. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>again focus on the theme of fasting today. Fasting was
mentioned in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the readings two days ago on Ash Wednesday. Psalm 51 is used</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>throughout Lent, and it was used on Ash Wednesday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the reading from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah, the people are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>complaining to GOD: “Why</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>do we fast, and You [,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD,] do not see it? We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>afflict ourselves, and You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>take no note of it.” GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>responds by pointing out to them that their fasting leads to
quarreling and fighting. The fasting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that GOD desires should lead to freeing the oppressed,
feeding the hungry, sheltering the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>homeless, and clothing the naked – that is, to acts of
compassion, love, and mercy – sounding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>similar to the Beatitudes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus also talks about fasting. He reminds
the disciples of John the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baptist that while the Groom is present, the wedding guests
do not fast. When the Groom is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gone, then fasting is appropriate. Jesus used the analogy to
speak of His disciples not fasting while He was present with them. Yet when</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they experience His absence, it will give them cause to
fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fasting, therefore, should not be just doing with less or no
food. Although that might be healthy for some of us, myself included, so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we might lose weight, the real purpose of fasting is
not that. Fasting is the emptying of those aspects of our lives that hinder us
from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the full awareness of the Lord Jesus’ presence with us and
the awareness of what GOD wants us to do with our lives, particularly in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>respect to others and their needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If our fasting from food, or other pleasures in our lives,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leads us to being grouchy or angry or fighting with others,
it is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not the fasting GOD wants. That was part of the point of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the First Reading. Fasting should allow us to cleanse</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ourselves of what is surplus in our lives, even that which
we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>think we need, and focus on people who are in real need:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the oppressed, the hungry, the homeless, the naked. I was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminded of that a year ago when many people in Southern</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>California lost everything in the fires the destroyed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thousands of homes. We are to open our eyes to those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>suffering not only in our local communities but anywhere in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the world. This idea is incorporated in practices that we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should be doing on regular basis – the Spiritual and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Corporal Works of Mercy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fasting should lead us to helping others and also to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>remind us of the need to remove the excesses in our lives.
If we cling to anything that prevents us from seeing GOD and GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presence in the lowly, then we need to let go of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago, in one of the OCIA sessions that I
facilitate on Sundays, the participants shared how they have been more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>conscious of those who were on the fringe of society. I felt
reassured as I heard the way members of the group had reached out to those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in need. One person shared how she had bought and shared
food with a homeless person at a fast-food restaurant. Another related that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>she, in her job, deals with the mentally disabled persons
and she sees her actions not just as a way to pay the bills, but a mission to
care</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for those who sometimes have no one else to fight their
fights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way of looking at fasting is to say that when we do
not sense the presence of the Lord Jesus in our lives, that is the time we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need to empty ourselves of whatever is blocking our
awareness of His presence and re-fill ourselves with the reality of GOD being
with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us. It should also open our eyes to the needs of others. As
we look to those less fortunate, we will see the Lord Jesus, for Jesus unites</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Himself with the deprived and needy. Fasting from food, from
pleasurable activities (such as movies and television and time on other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>electronics), and from spending money, should lead us to be
more giving to others in a way that we would not have been if we had not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fasted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a men’s Bible Study, some of the participants shared how
they are more aware of the Lord Jesus as they feed the poor, and give</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them gloves, coats, and sleeping bags, especially during
these winter months. They mentioned how blessed and filled with grace they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience as they reach out to the needy. They also share
the Word of GOD with the lowly and poor as they share food and clothing. In</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>another Bible Study that same week, the participants in the
Bible Study shared how being a listening ear is important. We have had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experiences to the one to whom we are listening, but we should
not say such things as, “been there, done that,” and then stop listening to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the person suffering. We need to be empathetic, sympathetic,
compassionate (all words the in the original Greek and Latin mean,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“suffering with” the person who is speaking, and identifying
with their challenging times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, if we spend a day fasting from food, or at least
cutting some of the “extras” out, we could use the money to donate to a food</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bank. Fasting from watching a movie or a favorite television
show, could allow us time to spend visiting a sick friend, or to reading</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>scripture, or to writing a letter to someone. Fasting from
spending money could give us a little more to share with a charity,
particularly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one that is trying to meet the needs of the unfortunate. And
as we empty ourselves and focus on others, we will have a new and better</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>awareness of GOD working in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we should think of some way we can empty ourselves,
let go of something (even of “our” time), so that we can give it to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>someone else, someone who needs it. In doing so we will
experience the Lord Jesus being with us and uniting us to another person. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will both be blessed and enriched not only with doing
without the “thing” but with a greater awareness of GOD’s presence. Fasting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should allow us to empty ourselves so that we can be filled
with GOD’s love and GOD’s presence, that we in turn share with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What “things” in my
life do I need to let go of – “things” that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prevent me from being more open to GOD’s presence? How can I
use my emptiness to share with others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those gifts with which the Lord Jesus fills me? Who might
benefit most from my “fasting” this week? During</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the rest of Lent? Throughout my life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever present with us. Through
Your GOoDness, You bless us with many signs of Your love. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sometimes become more attached to the signs of Your love
rather than to You, the Giver of the signs and gifts. We surround ourselves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with things, and we fail to develop the relationship with
You and with others. Help us to do with less things, and to devote ourselves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more to relationships – with You and with those who cross
our paths, especially those who need our assistance the most. Instill in us the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>desire to fast. As we fast, help us focus not on ourselves
and the deprivation we experience, that could lead us to resentment, anger, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>frustration. Rather, help us see that as we empty ourselves
of “things,” we can be filled with Your love and share that love with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We thank You for giving us Your Son, Who has lived a life of
fasting from things and giving to others. May we follow the example of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Master-Teacher and give glory to You. We pray this in the
name of the Lord Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who is living and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
forever and ever. Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 58: 9b-14; Psalm 86: 1-2, 3-4, 5-6; Luke 5:
27-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our spiritual health is the focus of the readings today,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as I see it. The passage from Isaiah gives us a prescription</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of what we should do to maintain our spiritual health. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel reminds us that Jesus is the Divine Physician Who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is concerned about our spiritual (and physical) well-being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading from Isaiah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is a continuation of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>yesterday’s reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Isaiah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continues to remind</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us that if we turn away from our evil ways, then GOD will
renew us and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>restore us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel account of Jesus’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>calling of the tax collector, Levi</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Matthew), and his banquet for Jesus gives</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us Jesus’ words: “The healthy do not need a doctor, sick
people do. I have not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>come to invite the self-righteous to a change of heart, but
sinners.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these readings, I recall a visit to the
doctor’s office a couple</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of years ago. I did not feel unhealthy, but I knew that I
should go in for my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>check-up. It also gave me an opportunity to see why I have
been feeling the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way I had been feeling. As part of the exam, I had a series
of tests: blood</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>drawn, samples taken, and of course, the favorite, the
doctor’s examination that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>included a certain uncomfortable probing of the inner parts
of my body. It was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not fun. The doctor asked me questions about my lifestyle:
how much exercise</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been doing, what I have been eating, if I had been
taking the prescribed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>medicines. The doctor shared with me his findings and suggested
I keep taking my blood pressure medicine,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continue doing physical activities, and watching my diet. He
also suggested that I return regularly for follow-up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>meetings rather than wait a full year to visit him, that way
he could monitor a few areas about which he was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some ways I see Lent as my annual spiritual health exam.
It is a time when we should all go to our Spiritual</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doctor and have a spiritual check-up. We may not feel
totally unhealthy, that is we may not feel that we are full of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinfulness to the point of death in our relationship with
GOD (mortal sin). Yet going to the Spiritual Doctor gives</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us the opportunity to see how we are doing spiritually. Part
of Lent includes a certain number of tests. Some of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the tests may be a bit uncomfortable. Our spiritual Doctor
may challenge us about our spiritual lifestyle: what sort</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and how many spiritual exercises have we been practicing,
what have we been taking in, and if we have been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>following His past spiritual prescriptions. If we are
attentive to the Divine Physician, He will share with us His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>findings and suggest how we can take better spiritual care
by giving us prescriptions to get us back on the path of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spiritual health. He may suggest different spiritual
exercises, and ask us to spend some time fasting, in order to get</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rid of what has been weighing us down and slowing down our
spiritual journey. He might also suggest we return</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to Him for more regular visits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only people who do not need the Spiritual Physician are
those who think they can handle life without</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s help or those who think they are beyond the help of
the Divine Doctor. And just like people who deny the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>physical problems that they have and refuse to listen to
their doctors, so also it is with spiritual well-being of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>individuals – the people who refuse to listen to the divine
prescriptions. They will be the ones who will not be able</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to receive the benefits of the Divine Doctor. Similarly,
those who think they are beyond the help of the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ healing power, cannot be healed, because they have no
realization that GOD can work in their lives, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>therefore they are not open to help of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to admit that we are not spiritually fit. We have
ailments that only the Heavenly Care-provider can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heal. And as we travel through Lent and hear what the Divine
Doctor prescribes for us; we need to follow His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>advice. During Lent we are being told what we must do to be
restored to GOoD health – spiritual health. And just</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as with physical doctors who cannot force us to follow their
advice, we have the free will not to follow the GOoD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>advice of our Heavenly Physician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us take full advantage of this annual spiritual check-up
of Lent. We can share all of our concerns and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>problems with our SCP (Spiritual Care Provider). We belong
to a Heavenly Maintenance Organization (HMO).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may have to swallow some medicine that does not taste
pleasant, but the medicine is GOoD for us. We may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have to undergo more tests. Yet the results will be a clean
bill of spiritual health as we draw ever closer to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fullness of spiritual life that our Divine Physician wants
us to have. Lent may not be something to which we look</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forward, but it can be a time when we know what we must do
to get back on the right path of spiritual health. And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if we follow the Doctor’s advice during Lent, we will be
able to celebrate the new life that is ours through the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Risen Lord, especially on Easter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: For what ailments do
I need to seek the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Divine Physician? How are my spiritual exercises going? What
am I taking in that will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help me to realize that salus (healing, wholeness,
salvation) that comes only from the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heavenly Doctor? How can I show my concern for other
people’s spiritual health and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help them seek the spiritual care they can receive only from
the Heavenly Maintenance</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Organizer?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Director of the Heavenly
Maintenance Organization (HMO). Through Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoDness, You have assigned us the best SCP (Spiritual Care
Provider). We realize that we are all at least a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>little spiritually sick and need healing. We ask that we may
make use of this annual spiritual check-up of Lent, so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we can get back on the right path toward salus
(well-being, wholeness, healing, salvation). Through Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Spirit, may we receive the wisdom and strength to put
our Spiritual Physician’s advice into practice in our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lives. Give us the strength to face the tests that may be
necessary so that our Doctor can show us what we need to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>do to be restored to full spiritual health. We thank You for
showing us our need for the Heavenly Physician Who is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>willing to make house calls to us. We know that we are not
worthy that the Divine Healer comes to us, but if He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but speaks the Word, we shall be healed. We pray this
through Jesus, Our Doctor and Healer, Who is living and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
forever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name=Mar9></a>March 9, 2025 First Sunday in Lent   <a
href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Frances of Rome:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Deuteronomy 26: 4-10; Psalm 91: 1-2, 10-11, 12-13,
14-15;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Romans 10: 8-13; Luke 4: 1-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we celebrate the First Sunday in Lent, we are reminded
that we need to remember and be attentive to GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presence. In the First Reading, the words of Moses remind
the Israelites that they must constantly recall and make present</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the saving deeds that GOD has done (and is doing) for them.
The Responsorial Psalm is the prayer of one who trusts in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, especially during trying times. It is this psalm that
the devil misuses to tempt Jesus in the Gospel. Saint Paul</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminds the readers of his Letter to the Romans what is
important: to be faithful to the Word of GOD, confess it with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their mouths, and believe it in their hearts. In the Gospel,
as Jesus completes His forty day fast and retreat in the desert,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the devil tempts Him to succumb to weakness of other
mortals: seeking personal pleasure, power, and instant fame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading contains a creedal statement that the Israelites
were</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>supposed to profess at least yearly during Passover. It
summarizes their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with GOD by re-telling their story. It begins
with GOD’s call of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their ancestor (“Father”) Abraham. It recalls how they as a
nation traveled to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Egypt, became enslaved, and cried out to GOD for help. It
continues with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>describing how GOD saved them through mighty deeds and
eventual starts to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bring them to the Promise Land. What is important in their
remembering was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that they proclaim this profession of the faith as if it is
happening to them in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>present time. This is truly a zikaron – a remembering by
making a past</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>historical event be present and active. The Word of GOD is
not some history of past events. It is the living and present,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ongoing relationship that the people have with their GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist speaks of the personal trust in GOD. It, too,
is a remembering – a remembering of the promises GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>made to the Chosen People. GOD is the refuge and fortress –
the vehicle of protection and safety. In remembering</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s promises, the psalmist is aware of GOD being with him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul seems to be quoting an early Christian statement of
belief in his letter to the Romans. The key aspects of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>these creedal words is that one must not only recall
(remember) the fulfillment of the Word of GOD in one’s head, one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must also profess it with one’s mouth (by proclaiming it in
word), and make it alive in one’s heart – the source of not only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>love, but also action. The statement that must affect the
whole person is that Jesus is “LORD” (the name by which GOD is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to be called in the Hebrew Scriptures) and that GOD
(Abba-Father) has raised Jesus from the dead. Accepting this Word</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in one’s mind, on one’s lip, and in one’s heart assures the
salvation that was made possible through Jesus’ death and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>resurrection. Thus, the remembering of one’s belief must
involve the whole person – one’s thoughts, speech, and actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Luke’s account of Jesus’ forty days in the desert, it
seems that Jesus was tempted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>throughout His forty days. The climax comes at the end of
His desert experience, but it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does not even end there. After fasting for forty days, Jesus
was obviously hungry. When</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tempted by the devil, it would have been easy to succumb to
the temptation and change</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rocks into bread and satisfy His human hunger. Jesus recalls
that nourishment for the body</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is not the only type, or even the most important type, of
feeding that must be undertaken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being nourished by GOD’s Word is more life- (eternal life-)
sustaining than bread.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus begins His public ministry of proclaiming His
Abba-Father’s GOoD News, it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would be tempting to do it quickly, without the challenge of
ministering one-to-one with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people. How much simpler it would be to “make” everyone His
subject and “make” them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>believe because He, the powerful Ruler, demanded it. The
devil offers Jesus an instant and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>absolute power. Jesus realizes that He would have to give
honor to His Abba’s nemesis in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>order to have the quick fix. That is not even an option for
Jesus, Who seeks to do only His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lastly, the tempter misuses scripture (again) to tempt Jesus
to use His power for Himself</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>instead of for those whom He came to serve. Today’s Gospel
passage ends with the words,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“When the devil finished every temptation, he departed from
Him for a time” [the italics are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mine]. The devil was not done with his temptations of Jesus.
Satan would continue to try to distract Jesus away from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doing His Abba’s will and work. It was only by Jesus’
continued reliance on His relationship with His Abba that he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would be able to withstand the temptations and be faithful
to the GOoD News of GOD that He was to proclaim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge for me near the beginning of this holy season
of Lent is to focus on spending this forty-day period in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer and reflection, just as Jesus did in the desert. The
more I seek to profess my faith in my mind, with my lips, and in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my heart, the more I will be drawn into closer relationship
with Jesus and His Abba. This is a special time “lent” to me so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that the parts of my life that have died in the winter of my
life can “spring” into new life. (A play on words is in the last</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sentence: “Lent” means “spring” or “springtime.”) I also
must be prepared to be tempted as I draw closer to Jesus and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seek to do the will of His Abba. It may be the temptation to
forsake any sort of mortification (“dying to self”) in order to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>satisfy myself with things that produce a more comfortable
earthly life. I may think about finding a “quick fix” in order to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>get ahead, when I know it will take a lot of discipline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of my Lenten journey involves the act of remembering
(zikaron). I am called to remember what GOD has done</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for me, especially in and through the saving acts of Jesus.
As I contemplate and meditate on the life and ministry of Jesus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must use more than just my mind. I must be willing to
profess my faith in words, and even more importantly, I must</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>decide to commit my heart to the Lord Jesus by living a life
that proclaims my relationship with Him and His Abba in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>unity of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hopefully, when Easter rolls around in a few weeks, we will
be able to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus with even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more enthusiasm because we will have undergone a spiritual
desert experience (even with temptations) and will have been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>renewed in mind, body, and heart. It is then that we might
experience GOD’s Word in today’s psalm: “I will set them on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>high because they acknowledge My name. They shall call upon
Me, and I will answer them; I will be with them in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>distress; I will deliver them and glorify them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How will I make GOoD
use of this time “lent” to me</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>so that I might better be renewed in mind, body, and heart?
What spiritual discipline(s) will I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>practice to help me “remember” (“re-enact and make real”)
all that GOD has done for me,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>especially in and through Jesus? In what ways will I share
my faith relationship with others so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that they may also have a time of renewal during this Lenten
season?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD of all. Through Your GOoDness You
bless us in so many ways and ask us to remember Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>marvelous deeds. It is in our spending time in prayerful
reflection that we begin the process of professing our belief in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You. Not only do You ask us to keep Your majestic actions in
our mind, but You also expect us to proclaim with our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speech and our actions that You have saved us in and through
Your Son, Jesus. As we make our Lenten journey over the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>course of the next weeks, You ask us to dedicate ourselves
to deepening the new life You have given us in and through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ death and resurrection. For the times we have allowed
ourselves to fall into temptations and forgotten what You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would have us know, we seek Your pardon and strength. With
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, deepen our commitment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to grow spiritually during this Lent. To You be all glory,
honor, and praise. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who has died, is risen, and
is now living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a

Lent    <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Dominic Savio:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Leviticus 19: 1-2, 11-18;          Psalm 19: 8,
9, 10, 15;          Matthew 25: 31-46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today proclaim that the way we treat others
reflects our relationship with GOD, or to put it another way, we manifest our
love for GOD by our loving, and caring for, those around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage from Leviticus, we hear an expansion of the
Ten Commandments.  The pericope (extract from the Bible) today gives us some
practical ways of living out our love of neighbor (the focus of the second
section of the Ten Commandments).  Although most of the precepts are in the
negative form (“You shall not. . .), we can turn them around</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to see how we should be treating those around us.  We could
re-word verses 11 through 18 in the following way:  “Treat other people’s
properties with respect.  Be honest.  Be fair in your dealings with others. 
Pay back those to whom you owe money.  Treat the disabled with dignity, helping
them as they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need assistance.  Be honest and impartial in making
decisions.  Treat all equally.  Speak well of others when they need it,
especially if it is a life-or-death situation.  Love everyone.  Be positive and
edifying if you have to correct anyone.  Love your neighbor as yourself.”  And
we should do all these things because the LORD GOD is speaking to us and GOD is
Who GOD is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Responsorial Psalm for today, the psalmist proclaims
that keeping the commandments brings us new life and joy.  This is because the
precepts help people to see others as GOD sees them, that is, worthy of
attention and respect because they are loved by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s Gospel is the familiar passage about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Final Judgment.  The focus of our being judged will not
be based on how many times we went to church on the LORD’s Day, how much money
we contributed to a church, how many prayers we rattled off, or how many times
we committed certain sins.  The criteria for our being welcomed into the Reign
of Heaven is how we treated the less fortunate and the needy.  It is in our
caring for, and serving of, others that we show our care and love for GOD.  The
Lord Jesus does not “need” us to love GOD.  Yes, it is an obligation to do so. 
GOD is not less because we do not love GOD.  GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will continue to be GOD even without our loving of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those people, however, who are in need (the hungry, the
thirsty, the naked, the strangers, the sick, the imprisoned) do need us to care
for them.  They may only come to know that GOD loves them by our ministering to
them in their time of difficulty.  So, GOD wants, and needs, us to love them so
they will know GOD’s loving presence with them in their time of need.  If we
truly love GOD, we will love those whom GOD loves, that is, each and every
person, especially those experiencing rough times.  We manifest our
unconditional love for GOD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by unconditionally loving those who cannot pay us back.  If
we fail to care for those who need our attention, we are being selfish.  The
selfish and self-centered are the one who will not be invited into the Reign of
GOD.  And not only are we being selfish, but we are depriving others of an
experience of the GOD Who loves them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what can I do today to reach out and serve the Lord
Jesus Who is present in those in need? It might be as simple as sending an
encouraging note to someone to whom we have been meaning to write.  It may mean
offering our services to a neighbor who is taking care of family members and
needs a break.  I could offer to stay with the neighbor’s family while the
neighbor takes some time to do something for herself/himself, in order to
refresh her/him before returning to caring for her/his loved one.  It might
mean speaking a word of edification (building-up) to someone whom I sense is
having a rough time.  It may mean taking the time to stop the car and give
something to a beggar.  It might include saying a heart-felt “thank you” to a
person.  Praying for those who have asked us to pray for them is also
important.  Even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a smile can make a difference to someone, as said by one of
the members of a Bible Study I attend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Living out our readings today means giving our attention,
and help, to those who are in need.  It means we will become involved in the
lives of others who are having a rough time.  We are being called to be
unselfish and think of others rather than ourselves.  In doing so we are loving
GOD Who loves each person unconditionally.  We will do whatever we can to edify
and build up the other person because we know that is what GOD wants for them: 
a life of dignity and acceptance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I manifest
my love for GOD? Is it only in thought and prayer, or does it flow into my
action of caring for others? How can I more consciously demonstrate my
unconditional love for GOD through my treatment of people today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving of each and every
person.  Through Your GOoDness, You ask us to love You by our treating others
in the same way Your Son, Jesus, treated each person – with dignity and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>respect.  You call us to love our neighbors so that they
might experience Your unconditional love and grow in relationship with You. 
You have empowered us to love others with the love we have received from You. 
You have chosen us to be part of Jesus’ ministry of announcing the GOoD News of
the undying divine love that You have for each individual.  Through the power
of Your Holy Spirit, gives us the wisdom and strength to reach out to those
around us.  Let us see Jesus’ presence in each person and help us to serve them
as we would serve Him. We give You thanks and glory as we realize the privilege
we have in ministering in the name of Jesus.  We pray this in His name, for He
is Your Son and our Brother, Who is living in His sisters and brothers as well
as with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. 
Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of the First Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from:
http://usccb.org/bible/readings/031125.cfm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. John Ogilvie: https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-ogilvie</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 55: 10-11; Psalm 34: 4-5, 6-7, 16-17,
18-19; Matthew 6: 7-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading (from Isaiah), we hear that GOD’s Word
is powerful and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>effective. The Hebrew word for “word” is dabar. The Dabar
YHWH is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Word of the LORD.” When GOD speaks, things happen. Thus, at
creation GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spoke and the world was created. To the Hebrew mind, words
are not just</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>symbols on paper or sounds in the air. Words have an effect.
So, today we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminded that GOD’s Word is creative, alive, and powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our psalm we hear that not only does GOD speak and things
happen, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD also listens, particularly to the afflicted and the
poor. And GOD’s listening</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>also leads to action, for GOD responds by ministering to
those who call out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus tells His followers that prayer is
more than just a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>multiplication of words. Prayer should be the building of a
relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD. Jesus then shares with His disciples the prayer which
is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sometimes called the “Model Prayer” or the “Lord’s Prayer”
or simply, by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>its first words, the “Our Father.” This prayer speaks about
having a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prayer begins by acknowledging Who GOD is. GOD is “Our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father.” Notice the word is “Our,” not “My,” Father. Jesus
is reminding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us that one prays this prayer as a community, even if one
says it when one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is praying by oneself. We are not alone when we say this
prayer. We are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>united with all those who call upon GOD as “Father.” In other
passages,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus reminds us that GOD is not just our Father, GOD is our
Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a more intimate word that can be best translated as
“Daddy” or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Papa.” It is a term that a child calls his own parent and
not any other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>person’s parent. It implies a loving relationship. Jesus is
letting us know that there is a new (or at least more intimate)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way of relating to GOD. He reminds us that the One Who is
far up in heaven is also the One Who is intimately in touch</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with us. GOD is not like an absent parent who does not get
involved in children’s lives. GOD is an Abba Who wants to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be a part of the children’s way of living. The same GOD Who
reigns in heaven is also only a word away when GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>children call out, “Abba.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s name is holy. The chosen people of GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>revered the proper name of GOD so much they never</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spoke it. When then came to the four consonants YHWH,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they never pronounced the name but used the word Adonai</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>meaning “the LORD.” Jesus says this same GOD Whose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>name the Hebrew people revered as holy is now being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>revealed as Abba-Daddy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prayer in Greek ends a few of the first phrases with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>same word, σου (sou), “of You.” In Greek, it is very</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>poetic and shows that things belong to GOD. Roughly the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>phrases can be translated in the exact Greek word order as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Holy be the name of You, may come the kingdom of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You, may be done the will of You.” It emphasizes the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>importance of GOD and the relationship we should have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD. Thus, we are called to pray that GOD’s Reign and
GOD’s Will be done by us just as it is being done in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heaven. There is a unity – a union of GOD, GOD’s plan, and
us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second part of the prayer uses various forms of the
first person, plural pronoun: we, us, our, ours. It focuses on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what our needs and our response should be. The next phrase
emphasizes our request for the here and now. It can more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>literally be translated as “the bread of us, for today, give
to us daily.” Bread is the daily sustenance we need to live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bread is not a feast food, that is, it is not luxurious
eating; it is only what is necessary to keep us going. The prayer is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>asking GOD to provide just what we need to survive today. We
are not asking for tomorrow, just for today. Yet, GOD, in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the divine abundance, will provide more than mere sustenance
– GOD will give us rich food; not just now, but eternally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next phrases are challenging for us. We ask for GOD’s
forgiveness. We ask that GOD treats us in just the way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we forgive others. Do we think about how we forgive others?
Is the way we reach out (or fail to reach out) a reconciling</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hand, the way we really want GOD to treat us? It all depends
on how we extend the branch of peace to others. This part</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the prayer should give us something to think about in our
relationship with others. A while ago, I was talking to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>someone, and the person said the act of reconciliation
(“seeing eye to eye again”) is more powerful when it is instigated</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by the one who has been offended. How true that is, and
especially with GOD. GOD seeks to be reconciled with us and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has offered us forgiveness before we even ask for it, but we
must ask for it and also be willing to extend it to others who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have hurt us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next phrase can be translated “do not hand us over to
the trial or temptation.” To me it means we are asking GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to protect us when we face temptation. Another way of saying
it, “Don’t let us fall when we are tempted” or “strengthen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us when we face temptation, so we do not fall into sin.” If
we are aware of our relationship with GOD, it is harder to sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we forget about our relationship with the Lord Jesus
and His Abba-Father, sin comes more easily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next phrase can be translated in a couple of ways: “But
deliver us from evil” or “deliver us from the Evil One.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Either way we are asking that GOD, our Abba, protect us so
we do not succumb to evil or the wiles of the devil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The doxology (“for Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory forever and ever) that is sometimes used at the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>end of the Lord’s Prayer is not in all of the most ancient
Greek texts, so some scholars are not sure whether or not they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>were added by earlier Christian when the manuscripts were
copied or deleted by other transcribers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel passage for today ends with an explanation of the
part of the Lord’s Prayer dealing with the way we want</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD to forgive us, that is, in the same way in which we
forgive others. It reminds us if we are not forgiving, then GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will not be as forgiving with us as when we are forgiving of
others who have wronged us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings remind me of the relationship I am called
to have with GOD. GOD is the Supreme Being, the Ruler</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of heaven. Yet even though GOD is almighty and supreme, GOD
chooses to have a relationship with us. The Lord Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wants us to have an intimate way of communicating with His
Abba – our Abba. We are reminded that GOD speaks the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Divine Word and things happen, but GOD also listens and
takes action when we, GOD’s lowly, beloved children, call out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to GOD our Abba. We are to establish a relationship in which
we give GOD what is due, yet also a relationship in which</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we ask GOD to be active in our lives and to treat us as we
seek to treat others. This is an awesome way of relating to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Almighty. This is something that gives us reason to just
ponder Who GOD is in our lives and how it should lead us to act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Angela Salawa: https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-angela-salawa</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Jonah 3: 1-10; Psalm 51: 3-4, 12-13, 18-19; Luke
11: 29-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings deal with possible destruction of a Middle
Eastern area,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>repentance, and new beginnings. The First Reading takes
place in what today is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Iraq. Jonah is sent to announce the destruction of the area
because of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinfulness of its leaders and the people. The psalm reminds
us that GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>does not want external sacrifices but contrite hearts. In
the Gospel, Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>warns about the lack of metanoia (repentance, change of
heart) on the part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the people of His day. Because they refuse to turn away from
sin, they will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be judged by other leaders and nations, that is people who
turned from their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinful ways to do what is right, even though they were not
part of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Chosen People.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading, after</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spending three days in the belly of a great sea creature,
Jonah decides to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forsake his path that took him away from doing the LORD’s
will. He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reluctantly agrees to do what GOD wants him to do. He begins
to announce</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the destruction of Nineveh (a city that lies between the
Tigris and Euphrates</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rivers in what today is Iraq). During the first day of his
three-day journey</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through Nineveh, the people and the ruler of Nineveh decide
to turn away</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from their sinful ways and repent; they have a change of
heart (metanoia).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The fear of destruction leads the Ninevites to beg GOD not
to wipe out them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and their land. GOD has a change of heart (relents) and does
not carry out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the destruction planned for the city of Nineveh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist proclaims that GOD desires an offering from the
heart rather than a physical offering of some animal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sacrifice. External rituals and actions done just to be seen
by others is not what GOD wants. GOD desires the people to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have a change of heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus also speaks of a change of heart
(metanoia). He warns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the people of His day that they are sinful and need to turn
around their lives. He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminds them that the non-believing people of Nineveh showed
their change of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heart, and, because of that, GOD relented (had a metanoia -
change of heart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>concerning) the punishment that GOD had threatened to
inflict on them. Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forecasts that the Ninevites will come in judgment over the
unrepentant people of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His time, because the people of Jesus’ time did not repent
even though He (Jesus)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is greater than Jonah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to interpret the readings as saying that the
people of that Middle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>East area of the world have been acting (especially with the
War between Israel and Hamas that started over two years</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ago) just like their sinful ancestors. We can be like Jonah
in the verses following today’s passage. We, like Jonah, may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>want GOD to punish and destroy those who are not like us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wonder if that really is the message that GOD wants us to
have from today’s readings. Maybe the message is that we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should first examine our own actions. Jonah had to do that
after he realized that he had turned away from GOD and had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>set sail in the opposite direction of Nineveh because he had
been told to proclaim GOD’s message to “those foreigners.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stormy times at sea and being in the belly of a large
sea creature for three days made Jonah start to turn his heart to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the LORD. Yet Jonah still did not have his heart completely
in line with the LORD. He did not care that the people of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nineveh repented and that they sought GOD’s forgiveness. In
fact, he wanted GOD to destroy the Ninevites even though</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they repented. He was angry because it would look like he
was a bad prophet, announcing destruction and then having</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD not wipe the people away. He cared for his own image
rather than GOD’s compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are we like Jonah? Do we want the destruction of the
supposed evil doers even if they admit their wrongdoings and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>practice acts of metanoia - repentance? Or are we willing to
have our enemies repent and turn to GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus warns the people of His time that they need to listen
to His message, examine their own behavior, and repent of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their sinfulness. They should not rely solely on their
external rituals and sacrifice. The people of Nineveh will rise up in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>judgment over those who presume that they are in the right
when, in fact, they are only deceiving themselves and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel personally challenged by the readings today. I realize
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to take stock of my own actions. I must admit my
wrongdoings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and turn my heart more fully to the Lord Jesus. Metanoia
(repentance)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is not a one-time thing, or something only for others.
Metanoia is a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Greek word that literally means “a change of mind” or a
change in my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way of life after thinking about my current lifestyle. To
the Biblical</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jews, it meant a change of heart, since the heart, to the
Hebrew people of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>old, was the source of decision making. Thus, metanoia was
changing a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>person’s thinking process to be more in line with GOD’s will
and also a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>change in behavior based upon the enlightened thought
process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been having a strong sense that metanoia is not just
for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me as an individual. I think we as a nation and as members
of the earth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are being called to have a metanoia and reflect on how we
communally</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have not been fulfilling GOD’s will. We individually and
collectively must have a “change of mind/heart” and see how</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we have not fulfilled what GOD wants us to do for our time
and for future generations. We must repent and seek GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness and take action to right our personal and
communal wrongs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, I, as an individual and part of the human race, am
called to repeatedly turn to the Lord Jesus, admit my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinfulness, and seek GOD’s forgiveness. As a sign of my
acceptance of the forgiveness and gift of salus that comes from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the death and resurrection of Jesus, I should strive to live
as much of a Christ-like life as I can, that includes being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassionate and understanding and working for peace and
justice, especially for “foreigners” and people different from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me. I must work for the betterment of my community, my
country, and my world. I join with the psalmist today and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pray: “My sacrifice, O GOD, is a contrite spirit; a heart
contrite and humbled, O GOD, You will not spurn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Am I sometimes
guilty of having a “holier-than-thou”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>attitude? Do I sometimes become upset with GOD when I sense
that GOD is not treating others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the way that I think they should be treated, that is, the
evil doers should be punished? From</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what sinfulness must I turn away and have a contrite and
humbled heart/decision-making-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>process? What can I do to repent of what I have done
individually and what we have done</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>communally as a community, as a nation, and as fellow
earthlings. How can I extend the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassion and forgiveness of the Lord Jesus to others,
especially those who have wronged me</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or oppose my viewpoint?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever compassionate and always
forgiving. Through Your GOoDness, You challenge us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to honestly look at our own lives and see what it is that is
blocking us from being as close to You as You want us to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through Your Son, Jesus, You have restored the relationship
between You and us. Yet, we continue to not fully turn to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You with humble and contrite hearts, and a change of living.
By the continued outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, strengthen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us to follow Your Son. After repenting and turning to You,
help us to pray for the true metanoia of others and rejoice</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when they repent of their sins and turn to You also. May we
be as understanding and compassionate of others as You and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Son are of us. May we give You all the glory and praise
as people repenting individually and communally, and as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people accepting the gift of salvation that You offer in and
through the death and resurrection of Your Son, Jesus. It is in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His name that we make this prayer, for He is Your Son, our
Brother and Savior, the One Who calls us into a relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with You and Who is living and reigning together with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Leander of Seville:
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-leander-of-seville</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Esther C: 12, 14-16, 23-25; Psalm 138: 1-2ab,
2cde-3, 7c-8; Matthew 7: 7-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading comes from a section of the book of Esther
which is not found in all Christian Bibles. It is part of Greek version of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the book, and it is therefore in Catholic Bibles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our readings today, we are reminded that we must lift up
prayer to a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loving and caring GOD Who responds to those who ask for
help. The First</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading is the prayer of Queen Esther as she seeks GOD’s
wisdom and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help. The Responsorial affirms that GOD hears the prayers of
those who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>call upon the LORD. In the Gospel, Jesus informs His
listeners (including</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us) that if we ask, GOD will respond to our prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading today comes from the prayer of Queen
Esther. She, a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jewess, is about to go to her husband, a non-Jewish king.
She is going to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speak on behalf of the people of her Jewish faith. She risks
her life and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lives of all the Jewish people by doing so. She prays a
prayer asking GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to remember the divine promises to the Hebrew ancestors. She
asks that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD give her the correct words to speak to the king in order
to save the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jews from annihilation by the king’s royal officers, who are
very strongly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anti-Semitic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes the theme in the prayer of Queen Esther.
The response repeats the words: “LORD, on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>day I called for help, You answered me.” If we humbly and
honestly seek GOD’s help, GOD will respond to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our prayer, especially as we are open to seeing how it fits
into GOD’s plan for salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus affirms the theme of GOD’s willingness
to answer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who seek GOD. We hear the familiar words: “Ask, and
you will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>receive. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be
opened to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus continues by giving the analogy of parents’ concerns
for their children,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>giving them what they need and not wanting to cause them
harm. If human</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parents can show such love for their children, how much more
will GOD,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the unconditionally loving Parent, show concern for us,
GOD’s children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of all prayer is supplication – asking GOD for what we
(and others)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need. It is not the first or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>most important part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer, but it is an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>integral part of prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prayer should include</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adoration, Contrition</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and Thanksgiving, besides Supplication. Part of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with GOD is being aware that GOD is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>source of all we need, and we should turn to GOD and ask</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for GOD’s help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When children in the family are small, the parent sometimes
waits until the children ask for something. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loving parent does not do it to be mean. The parent knows
what they need, but the parent does not want them to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be presumptuous and to think that loving parent would supply
their every need even before they ask. And even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when they ask, the parent does not always give them what
they think they need, and at the time they want it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The caring parent is concerned and wants them to have the
very best, but sometimes the children need to be in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with the parent before the parent gives them
what they need. The parent does not want to be just a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vending machine that dispenses what they want when they push
the right button. GOD is even more of a wise</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and loving Parent. GOD, too, is more concerned with
relationships than just dispensing gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am intrigued by the Greek verb form of the words “ask” and
“seek” and “knock” in today’s Gospel. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Greek text uses a form that implies a continued action
(imperfect imperative). Thus, these words could be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>translated “Ask and keep on asking. . .Seek and keep on
seeking. . .Knock and keep on knocking.” We have to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be in a continuous relationship with GOD, recalling our need
for GOD’s assistance. By our asking, we show</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our need to be in relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD does answer our prayers. GOD may not always answer our
prayers in the way we want, but GOD will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>answer them by doing what is ultimately best for us. GOD may
say, “Yes” with no more questions asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD may say, “No, not now, it is not what is best for you –
at this time.” And GOD may say, “I’ve got a better</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>idea.” So, when we ask, we need to be open to the way GOD
will answer our request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Lenten journey, we come before the Lord
Jesus and admit our dependence on GOD. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should ask that we be given what we truly need to grow into
the persons GOD is calling us to be. Yes, we can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make specific requests for others and for ourselves. This
shows our desire to be caring and loving both others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and ourselves. (After all we are called to love others as we
love ourselves.) We might want to begin by asking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD to help us ask for the correct things in the correct
way, always according to the divine will, just as Esther</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>did in our First Reading today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When I turn to GOD
in prayer, what is my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>attitude? Do I ask, seek, and knock, trusting that GOD will
answer my prayer and give</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me what I truly need, not necessarily everything that I
want? Am I consistent in my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer, praying constantly? For what do I pray? How can I
make my prayer be more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other-centered? How can I share the importance of prayer
with others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Parent. Through Your
GOoDness, You care for us more than we care</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for ourselves. You have chosen to give us the very best –
Your Son, Jesus. He invites us to turn to You and be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in relationship with You, and to ask for what we need to
deepen that relationship with You and with our sisters</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and brother in the Lord Jesus, Your daughters and sons by
adoption. By the power of Your Holy Spirit, give us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the wisdom to seek what is best for us and for others. We
stand at Your door, knocking with the expectation that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will open the door for us, so we might be with You. Help
us to be in the proper relationship with You so we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can accept Your response to our asking. May we always give
You glory and honor for how You touch our lives</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with Your grace as You answer our prayers. As always, we
make this prayer in the name of Jesus the Christ,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Son and our Brother, Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forever and ever. Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of the First Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Ezekiel 18: 21-28 Psalm 130: 1-2, 3-4, 5-71
Matthew 5: 20-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD calls us into a relationship. We can choose to work
toward</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>building up that relationship, or we can choose otherwise.
Our choice</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not only affects us, but it also affects other members of
the edifice of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD known as the Church. Our First Reading reminds us that
we will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have to live eternally by the final choice we make. The
Responsorial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm proclaims the merciful and forgiving qualities of our
GOD. In the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel, Jesus commands us to take seriously our relationship
with other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>members of the household of GOD and do everything we can to
be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciled with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading (from Ezekiel) speaks about GOD giving us
free will and then GOD will judge us on our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>final choice at the end of our lives. Just because people
have been faithful most of their lives, if they reject</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD in the final moments of their lives, GOD will respect
their final choice. Likewise, if sinful individuals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>turn from their sinful ways and toward GOD at the end of
their lives, GOD will grant them life based on their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>final choice. Yet it is not easy to make a 180 degree turn
in the last moments of our lives. Obviously, the best</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>choice is to be faithful throughout our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm response to Ezekiel is Psalm 130 in which we are
reminded that GOD is kind and full of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciling redemption and will redeem us from all our
inequities, only if we trust in GOD and wait for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD. It praises the generous mercy of GOD, reminding us
that if GOD held our sins against us, none of us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would be saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel speaks of our relationship with our family (our
blood family, spiritual family, and the human</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>family). Jesus raises the level of consciousness and speaks
of the need to be reconciled with our family. Not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>only is physical harm against another considered to be
wrong, even abusive language and unreconciled</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>differences can be disastrous to our spiritual life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting on these readings leads me to realize that my
starting point (and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my ending point) should always be with Jesus (that’s a very
GOoD place to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>start – and end). Jesus is the Bedrock of our faith. Without
the Bedrock</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>under the cornerstone, the storms of life will wash away
even the foundation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>stones. The foundation stones are the leaders of the Church
(apostles and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their successors). We are part of the building, the edifice.
We need to build</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ourselves on those who have helped us to get to this point.
They supply the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>support we need to keep the building moving upward (ad Deum
– to GOD).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, in turn, help support others in this edifice of GOD’s
House, the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we are out of line with other members of the structure of
the Church, then</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we need to get back in line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Builders use a plumb line to be sure the building blocks are
in line. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>weight at the bottom points down (to the firm foundation).
The building</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blocks need to be aligned with the plumb line. Pastor Mike
Landry remarks:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A carpenter cannot build a house without a plumb line. It’s
not good</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>enough to try to line things up by sight. The house will end
up crooked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The same principle applies to our lives. To live a life
worth living and one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that is constructive and beneficial to others requires the
Spiritual Plumb Line (Who is Jesus). Our personal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perspectives and experiences are much too limited and finite
if we do not have the Guide to being lined up with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the rest of the Church. A life lived with no regrets must be
built with [the Plumb Line Who] guides us and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gives us true readings.” One thing about our being the rocks
of the edifice, we have free will. We can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perform our function as supporting blocks in the building.
We can also refuse that responsibility by turning our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>back on the bedrock. We can do this particular if we are out
of line (out of relationship) with other blocks in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>edifice. If we, the building stones, are at odds with each
other, with their forces working in different directions,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the building, or at least the part relying on us, will not
be stable, and it will fall. It is only when we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciled and of one mind – the mind of Jesus – that we can
fit together to become the strong structure that we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are called to be. Yes, the mercy of GOD can hold things
together stronger than our own weakness, but our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>negative choices can cause problems to the living stones
around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, we need to examine our role in the structure of GOD’s
House.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are all called to be integral parts of the building and
to be supported by,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and be the support to, the other parts of the edifice. We
need to look at our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relations with the other parts of the structure and see if
we are doing what we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are called to do. We need to pray for all parts of the House
of GOD and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>realize that united with the Bedrock and the cornerstones,
we stand – and if we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are divided, we fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if we notice that we are not in union, or lined up, with
the other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>building blocks, and especially with Jesus the Divine Plumb
Line, then we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need to seek reconciliation with those with whom we are out
of alignment or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from whom we are separated. Being out of line with the rest
of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>structure is not only harmful to those who have supported us
or whom we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>called to support, but also, it is being out of line with
the Bedrock and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Divine Plumb Line. During this Lent we are given the
opportunity to get</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>back in line with the rest of structure of GOD’s House. Let
us see how we can get in line and focus on our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>union with others and with Jesus, the Bedrock/Plumb Line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Where do I see
myself in the edifice known as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Church? Am I aligned with Bedrock-Plumb Line and the other
parts of GOD’s house or am I out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of line? What can I contribute to helping support the other
members of the building known as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Church – the Body of Christ? Are there individuals with whom
I should seek to establish a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciled relationship?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, gracious and merciful GOD. Through
Your GOoDness, You call us to a life that is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>based on the Bedrock and Plumb Line of our faith, Jesus the
Christ, Your Son. We have sometimes thrown our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>weight around, so we are out of line with the rest of the
edifice of Your building. You give us the opportunity to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be re-aligned, so that we are resting on the supportive
people who are below us and we can give support to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who are beside us and those who depend on us for their
strength and those who will be built on us. We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thank You for allowing us to be part of Your plan to build
up and become the one Church of Your Son, Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, help us to be
reconciled with those who are out of line with us (and with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus – the Plumb Line), and to work for the unity to which
we are all called. We pray this in the name of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, the Bedrock and Divine Plumb Line) AMEN.    <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of the First Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Louise de Marillac:
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-louise-de-marillac</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Deuteronomy 26: 16-19; Psalm 119: 1-2, 4-5, 7-8;
Matthew 5: 43-48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings are challenging, but that is what they should
be, especially during Lent. From the passage from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deuteronomy and Psalm 119 we are reminded of the importance
of following the commands of GOD. The section</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from Matthew raises the standard above merely the Golden
Rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading and Responsorial Psalm proclaim that those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who keep GOD’s law will be blessed. GOD will look favorably</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>upon those who seek to do the will of GOD and live out the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>commandments that GOD has given. One of the derivations of
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>English word, commandment, is that it comes from two Latin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>words, com meaning “together,” and manus meaning “hand.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, a commandment is what allows us to join our hands
together</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD. If we keep GOD’s commandments, our hands our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>joined together with GOD’s and GOD’s hands with ours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>raises the commandments</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to a higher level. Instead of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>just loving those of our own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>family, faith, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fatherland, we are challenged to love our enemies and pray
for our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>persecutors. For if we only love those who love us and only
treat nicely</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those from whom we expected to get something back, we are
not acting like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD Who loves all people and treats everyone with justice
and equality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are asked to prove that we are children of our adopting
GOD by loving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>everyone as GOD loves. We are called to reach out our hands
and join them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>together with all others, even those with whom we have
problems and/or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disagreements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I ponder how GOD can love
everyone</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>equally and fairly and yet look favorably upon those who do
GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will. It sounds like GOD is both impartial and partial at
the same time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I think more about it, I realize that GOD loves everyone
with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>infinite, unconditional love. GOD does not withhold divine
love from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anyone. GOD is willing to extend the divine hand to all.
Yet, some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people respond to GOD’s love in a way that seems like they
are being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blessed more than others. And, in a sense, they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An analogy came to me. A loving parent gives the same gift
of a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>flower bulb to each of two children. With the flower bulb
comes a list of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>instructions for the care of the flower. One child takes the
bulb and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>plants it in a clay pot, waters it, makes sure that it
receives the right</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>amount of light, as directed in the set of instructions
given by the loving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parent. The bulb blooms with beautiful flowers. The child
feels a close</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with the parent who has given the gift which is
now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>flowering. The second child takes the gift of the bulb and
puts it on a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>shelf in a dark closet, together with the instructions the
parent had given</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the bulb. Obviously, it does not blossom. The child who
did not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>plant the bulb then becomes jealous of the sibling who has a
flowering plant and says, “How come you received a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>beautiful plant, and I didn’t.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other child responds, “You could have had a flowering
plant if you would have spent time and worked with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the bulb, and planted the bulb, and allowed it to grow, just
as we had been directed by our loving parent.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD gifts all people. GOD loves all equally. Some people
take the gift of GOD’s love and allow it to bloom and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>grow, and they focus on the directions/commandments that GOD
gives; while others either do not take advantage of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the gift, or refuse the gift all together, and then they
complain that they are not being treated fairly by GOD. GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loves each person, but GOD does not force people to use the
gifts (especially those that will produce beautiful growth)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that are given to them. GOD does not condone the action of
those who refuse to follow the divine instructions, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to love them. Or, as the old saying goes, “GOD
loves the sinner, but hates the sin.” GOD allows those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who do what GOD expects of them to experience even more of
GOD’s blessings, just as the child who plants the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parent’s gift of flower bulb can rejoice in the gift of the
flowering plant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what does that mean to me? First of all, I realize that
GOD loves me with an infinite and unconditional love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I do with the gift of that love can deepen my
relationship with GOD or it can be a block in the relationship. By</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my doing what GOD wants me to do with the gift of divine
love – allowing it to flower by sharing that gift with others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– I am blessed. Yes, it takes effort and work, and it is
sometimes difficult to follow the instructions (commands) that I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have been given. But only if I am willing to do what I am
asked by GOD, can I experience the fullness of what GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>intends for me to enjoy. When I accept what GOD’s loving
hand extends to me, I will be walking “hand in hand with”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, the Giver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also realize that GOD loves every individual with the same
infinite and unconditional love, even those who do not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accept or use the gift of divine love as GOD intends. And if
GOD loves each person as GOD’s own dear child, who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am I not to love them also? I must try to love and treat
everyone the same way GOD does. It is not always easy for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me to do so, because I may have been hurt by one, or I feel
uncomfortable when a certain person is around. Yet, I am</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>still called to love them. I must love them, in spite of
their actions. I must love the sinner, but I must hate the sin. I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must love my enemy, the person who really bugs me or has
hurt me, and I must separate the negative action from the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>person. I must pray for those who persecute me. I must love
others even if they cannot, or will not, love me back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is fulfilling GOD’s command. I must extend my hand to
them, so that, hopefully, we can “join hands” in our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>walk toward our loving GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, GOD loves everyone fairly and equally, but those who
respond to GOD’s love experience a relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD that moves them into a different level of experiencing
GOD. They sense GOD’s presence even in their most</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>trying and difficult moments. They can act with the
knowledge that they know GOD is loving them. And because of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that, they can love the other children of GOD, even if the
other children of GOD do not act according to GOD’s will or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>even know GOD at all. Thus, I must extend my hand toward the
other, and I must join my “hand with” another (even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if only virtually), and I must help them experience the hand
of GOD reaching out to them, and doing that can help all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of us work together, “hand with hand,” and make a difference
in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What have I done
with the gifts GOD has given me? Have I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tried to follow the instructions (commands) that GOD has
given with the gifts I have received? Do I seek</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to share those gifts with others, especially with those who
cannot pay me back and/or who differ with my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>point of view? Am I willing to reach out my hand toward
others? What act of kindness will I do today to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>show that I love all those whom GOD loves, even if they do
not know of the divine love or refuse to join</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“with the hand” of GOD?   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second Sunday in Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from: http://usccb.org/bible/readings/031625.cfm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Clement Mary Hofbauer:
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-clement-mary-hofbauer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Genesis 15: 5-12, 17-18; Psalm 27: 1, 7-8, 8-9,
13-14;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Philippians 3: 17-4:1; Luke 9: 28b-36</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our journey this Lenten season, we are
challenged to focus on the Lord Jesus. As we do so, we may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience a closeness in our relationship that transcends
our normal earthly activity and that empowers us to continue our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pilgrimage to our ultimate destiny with more strength and
enthusiasm. In our First Reading, Abraham has such an experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although he is a childless, wandering nomad, he undergoes a
spiritual event that draws him into a closer relationship with GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who promises him and his too-many-to-be-numbered descendants
a future homeland. The psalmist seems to have a similar</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>feeling of ultimate trust in the LORD. In today’s Second
Reading, St. Paul exhorts those who hear his letter being proclaimed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(both in Philippi and today) to focus not on earthly things
but on “our citizenship” in heaven. In the Gospel, Jesus allows His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>three closest disciples to see His glory as He is
transfigured before their eyes. Although they do not understand the full
meaning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>at this time, their continued relationship with Jesus leads
them to the place and time when they will better understand and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience Jesus’ ultimate moment of glory on the cross and
at tomb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s First Reading, Abram (later to be renamed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham) is at a key place in his travels (both</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>geographically and spiritually). He has left his homeland</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Ur of the Chaldeans and also Haran) and journeyed many</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>miles, all in obedience to GOD. In a time of prayer, he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hears GOD speaking to him both about his many offspring</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the land. For an elder man without a child, traveling in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a foreign land without a place to call his own, these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promises would have seemed almost totally unbelievable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, it is Abram’s faith in GOD that marks him as the father</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of believers in the one, true GOD. Abram follows GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>command of establishing a covenant (agreement) by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>splitting animals in half (or separating two birds). In the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tradition of the time, the two parties to the covenant would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>then pass between the split animals with the understanding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that if either of the parties broke the promises of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>covenant, the breaker of the agreement would physically be
split apart. In a mystical experience, GOD establishes a covenant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with Abram in which GOD alone (as manifested by the smoking
pot and flaming torch passing alone between the split animals)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is bound by the covenant. This is a unilateral relationship
that GOD makes with Abram and his descendants. GOD will provide</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a personal land and continued life for Abram (through the
multitude of his offsprings).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm is the prayer of one who sees GOD as
the Light and source of salvation. With one’s eyes focused</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on GOD, there is nothing to fear and no one of whom to be
afraid. The trust that the psalmist has is what leads him to believe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that he will see the bounty of the LORD in the land of the
living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul seems to have heard that there were individuals
within the Philippi</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>community who were teaching a more mundane approach to life
as a Christian. They were</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>focused on present pleasures and not focused on the cross of
Jesus and the ultimate destiny to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which all those who follow Jesus are called – citizenship in
heaven. It is only through the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cross of Jesus that we can experience the glory of heaven.
Paul challenges his listeners to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pattern their lives on the example of those who have a
relationship with the crucified, and yet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>glorified, Lord Jesus. It is only by being united to the
suffering, death, and resurrection of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus that one can achieve one’s citizenship in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today gives us Luke’s version of the
Transfiguration. It is important to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>realize the position of this event in Luke’s Gospel. First
of all, this takes place after Peter’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>profession of faith in Jesus as the Messiah (the Christ, the
Anointed One) of GOD. It is also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“sandwiched” between two of Jesus’ proclamations of His own
death. Thirdly, it takes place</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>while Jesus has gone up to the mountain to pray. There is an
intrinsic link between Jesus as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Messiah, His suffering and death, and this display of His
future glory, which, in a sense, is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>revealed to Jesus’ closest disciples at this moment. In
Luke’s Gospel, the Transfiguration</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>takes place just before Jesus heads up to Jerusalem for His
final ministry – His death and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>resurrection. Just as GOD, His Abba-Father, spoke words of
affirmation before His ministry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in Galilee; now again, GOD, His Abba, proclaims the special
relationship with Jesus and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>affirms Jesus in His final ministry in Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on all the readings and my journey during this
Lent, I sense a challenge to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>focus on my prayer life, and not just my rattling off
memorized words to GOD. The Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is calling me (and all faithful journeyers) into a
deeper relationship. Contemplative or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>meditative prayer is one means of drawing into that closer
and more intimate relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the GOD Who is Abba, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Part of the
contemplative (meditative)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>process is to realize that we are on a journey that does not
find its destination merely here on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>earth. It demands that we look beyond our worldly pursuits
to our ultimate destiny in heaven</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes this more reflective type of prayer may lead us
into a trance (like Abram) or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into an experience that is totally transfiguring (as Peter,
James, and John experienced). It may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>enable us to sense Jesus as the crucified, yet glorified,
Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of people have seen “The Passion of the Christ.”
Viewing or re-viewing the movie</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>may be a GOoD starting point for our reflective prayer. The
movie is not just another movie</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that is seen, but a vehicle for allowing us to ponder what
Jesus went through during His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>passion. I remember hearing a Christian radio commentator
mention that he had talked to Mel Gibson about the movie. He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wondered why Gibson had not “toned down” some of the graphic
images of Jesus’ suffering. Mel’s response was to affirm that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he had softened the graphics. In Mel’s mind, he had not been
able to fully capture all that Jesus went through during His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>passion. And I believe that is true. Not only did Jesus
suffer some of the physical pain, which is portrayed in the movie, but He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>also experienced tremendous emotional pain as His chosen
ones betrayed, denied, and/or deserted Him. All the mental pain,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and yet the sense of doing His Abba’s will, is also not able
to be portrayed on film. Yet it can be a place from which we can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>launch our meditative prayer time with the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, as the Gospel demonstrates, the passion of Jesus is not
the end of the story. Jesus is also glorified by His Abba. Jesus’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>transfiguration was a glimpse – a foretaste – of the glory
that Jesus ultimately experiences through His resurrection and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ascension. It is also meant to be a glimpse of the glory
that awaits us who journey along with our Lord Jesus, through this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>world of pain and suffering. We may not be able to fully
comprehend what awaits us (just as Abram could not fully grasp the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promises of a multitude of descendants and the land). Yet,
as we take the time to spend moments of reflective prayer with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus, especially during Lent, we can be drawn into that
closer relationship with Him and His Abba. It may mean that we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have to climb up the holy mountain (not necessarily
physically, but definitely spiritually). We need to get away from the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>crowds (our daily activities and problems) to spend time in being
in GOD’s presence in a more conscious manner. As we spend</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the time in prayer, we may also have an experience of GOD’s
glory. It may not happen ever time we are in prayer (just as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples did not always experience the Transfiguration of
Jesus every time they went where He was praying). Yet, the more we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are willing to be with the Lord Jesus, the more we will
experience what GOD has in store for us, the more we will understand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Love that GOD has poured out on us, the more we will be
able to proclaim with the psalmist today, “I believe that I shall see</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the bounty of the LORD. . .Wait for the LORD with courage;
be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How much time do I
spend in prayer and meditation,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seeking a deeper relationship with GOD? When have I
experienced the presence of the Lord Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in such a way that I was drawn even closer to GOD? How did
that experience and the later reflection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on that experience empower me to follow the Lord Jesus more
closely and to reach out to others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of glory and majesty. Through Your
GOoDness, You have called us into a closer relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with You. In order to make that invitation more vivid, You
sent Your Son, Jesus, to walk on this earth. He proclaimed Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD News in Word and in action, inviting individuals to
experience the Glory that You share with Him. Just as Your Son</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>withdrew from the activities of His day, and sometimes
brought along others to share in His relationship with You, You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continue to call us to take time away from our busy
schedules so that we can focus in our relationship with You, with Jesus, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the Holy Spirit. Yet so often, we busy ourselves with
activities (even GOoD ones) and fail to retreat into Your presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the times we have missed the opportunities to be
conscious of Your presence, we ask for forgiveness. Continue to pour out</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the gifts that flow from Your Holy Spirit, so we can have
the vision to see what You would have us see, so that we can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience Your glory as manifested in the life, ministry,
death, and resurrection of Jesus. Strengthen us as we travel along our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way to You. And may we give You all the glory, honor, and
praise, in union with Your Son and the Holy Spirit, for You are our one and
only GOD, forever and ever. Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of Second Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Patrick)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from: http://usccb.org/bible/readings/031725.cfm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Patrick:
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-patrick</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Daniel 9: 4b-10; Psalm 79: 8, 9, 11 and 13; Luke
6: 36-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today are appropriate for our Lenten journey.
We are sinful; we need to ask GOD to forgive us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as the prayer of Daniel demonstrates. We need to realize, as
the psalmist mentions, that if GOD treated us in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the way we should be treated, then we would be in a real
“hell” of a mess. In the Gospel, Jesus reminds us that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we should extend the forgiveness and pardon to others as a
sign of our awareness of how loving and forgiving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is to us when we seek pardon for our sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from the Book of Daniel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminds us that we are sinners, and we need</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s mercy. The First Reading is a beautiful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer for each of us as individuals, and as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>members of a community of faith, and as part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the human race. It begins by acknowledging</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who GOD is: “Great and awesome GOD, You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who keep Your merciful covenant toward those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who love You. . .” I am reminded of this every</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time a friend, who writes back in response to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflections he receives, frequently mentions that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our GOD is so awesome. There is also a song</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that is running through my head entitled</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Awesome God by Michael W. Smith. The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer of Daniel continues by including a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>section of contrition in which it says that we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have not done what GOD has expected of us. It calls upon GOD
to be compassionate and forgiving. As part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my daily prayer time, I reflect on the awesomeness of GOD in
general (reflecting on all that GOD has done</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>throughout time) and in particular (reflecting on what is
happening that day that demonstrates GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>awesomeness).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up this theme with the response</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>refrain being: “LORD, do not deal with us as our sins</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>deserve.” How true that is. If GOD dealt with us as our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sins deserve, none of us would have a chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus reminds all of His disciplined</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>learners (disciples), including us, that we must strive to
be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassionate as GOD is compassionate. The more we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>imitate the GOD Who is our Abba-Father, by being non-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>judgmental, non-condemning, extending pardon, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>giving, then the more we will be treated that way by our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD. I am reminded of a parent who says to an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>unforgiving child, “How would you like it if I treated you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the way you are treating your friend/sister/brother?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I particularly like the imagery that Jesus uses in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel. It is of a person who uses a generous portion when</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dispensing dry goods to others. I can just see someone</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who has been asked to give a cup of flour. The generous
person returns a cup that is overflowing and would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>measure out at 125% or 150% of the cup for which was asked.
Jesus then says when we ask something of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, especially that GOD be forgiving to us, GOD not only
fills our measuring cup to overflowing but pours</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>extra into our laps (or as another translations says, the
folds of garments [pockets]) and anywhere else GOD can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pour the abundance of that for which we ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflections lead me to realize that we have truly missed
the mark and sinned. We have done what was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wrong. Yet, our ever-gracious GOD is willing to forgive us
and not treat us as our actions deserve. Instead,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is willing to give to us abundantly. In return we need
to extend the same non-judgmental, non-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>condemning, and gracious forgiveness to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I think how awesomely</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassionate GOD is to me, a sinner, I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am moved to be more caring and generous</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with those who have offended me or with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who ask me for something. I should</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>give more than 100% of what people ask of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me, not just forgiveness but in all items for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which they ask. That is the way our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gracious and awesome GOD has been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>toward me/us. I should want to be loving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and caring towards other because I have experienced the love
and care that GOD has for me/us. In a sense the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Golden Rule for me is not “Do unto others the way you would
want to be treated by others,” but “Do unto</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others the way GOD has already done to you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How often do I
express my appreciation to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD for the gift of forgiveness that the Lord Jesus extends
to me, and that came about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through His death and resurrection? How willing am I to
extend the same compassion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and forgiveness to others, especially those who have most
offended me? What can I do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>today to demonstrate my understanding of the love and mercy
of our awesome GOD as I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>deal with those whom I encounter?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, awesome, ever gracious, and
abundantly kind. Through Your GOoDness, You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>extend to us Your compassion and mercy. We have turned away
from You and missed the mark of following</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You and Your Son. We do not deserve the forgiveness that You
are willing to extend to us. May we be ever</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more conscious of the abundance of Your kindness and be
willing to share with others so they too may become</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aware of Your generosity and love. Through the power of Your
Holy Spirit, helps us to get back on target and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>keep our sights on You and Your Son, Jesus. We ask this of
You through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of Second Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Cyril of Jerusalem)        </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Cyril of Jerusalem:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-cyril-of-jerusalem</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 1: 10, 16-20;         Psalm 50: 8-9,
16bc-17, 21 and 23;          Matthew 23: 1-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The readings speak of turning away from
wicked ways and repenting, not only because of the sins and wrongdoings that
have been committed, but also so one might be more free to serve others rather
than serve oneself.  In the First Reading, Isaiah addresses the people of
Israel.  He urges them to forsake their evil ways and change their lives.  The
psalm picks up this message and proclaims that what GOD wants of us are lives
of service, not just rituals – doing what is right, not doing of rites/rituals. 
In the Gospel, Jesus proclaims that the only one worthy of being Ruler and
Abba-Father is GOD.  Everyone else must follow the example that Jesus, The Only
Teacher, sets for us as He lives His life as a servant-leader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The First Reading takes place before the
Babylonian Exile.  In it, Isaiah reminds the people that it is not enough to
just turn away from wrong-doing and sin, they must also do GOoD, search for
justice, redress the wrong, hear the cry of the poor and come to their aid, and
defend the helpless.  This message is as much for us as the people of GOD
during the time of Isaiah.  If we commit ourselves to doing the right things,
it will be a sign that we are serious about metanoia – change of heart,
re-directing our lives toward GOD, – and GOD will be forgiving of our sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The psalm response once again tells us that
GOD does not want external signs and ritual sacrifices (rites).  Rites
(rituals) have their place in our relationship with GOD, but they are not the
be-all and end-all.  The importance of doing right (GOoD) actions is even more
pleasing to GOD.  GOD wants us to be people who live a life of GOoDness and
holiness – that is, live out the GOoDness and holiness with which GOD has
gifted us.  GOD will then show us the divine saving power.  Doing right actions
is more important than performing rites and rituals, especially if we only do
it make it look like we are righteous and holy.  We are also reminded of the
importance of discipline – living the life of a disciple-student, that requires
us to act like, and follow the example of The Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In today’s Gospel, Jesus criticizes those
leaders who do not walk the talk.  They might say the right things, but they do
not live them out in their own lives.  He goes on to warn His followers to
avoid thinking they are better than others and deserving of special titles of
respect.  He speaks of the need to be servants to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In today’s readings, I hear a call for me to
be a humble servant who seeks to manifest to others the presence of GOD Who is
with me.  It starts with a realization that I am a sinner who has missed the
mark (i.e., sinned) of being totally on target with GOD.  I have had other
pursuits in the cross hairs of my scope rather than doing what is right and proper
according to GOD.  Sometimes I have assumed it was enough if I did rites
(performed rituals), without doing right (GOoD GODly deeds for others).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I am being called to care for others and
serve them because I know that GOD is with me and is willing to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgive me.  I am being given the opportunity of announcing
the GOoD News of GOD’s presence to others by doing the right thing, bringing
justice to those who have been wronged, caring for those who need help.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The role of a disciple of Jesus is to
realize Who the Master-Teacher is.  Thus, the job of the disciple is to always
point to the Master-Teacher and realize that I am only His disciple
(disciplined learner) who seeks to reveal the Master’s love by my imitation of
His loving care for others.  Being a disciple of the Master-Teacher, and
practicing the discipline of the Master, takes work.  It is much more than head
knowledge.  It takes doing the right thing over and over and over.  I should
not be seeking titles and positions of honor, but I should be willing to humbly
serve others.  Yes, I might be called to serve as one who leads others or one
who instructs others, but I am only a temporary substitute for the One Who is
The Teacher and The Leader.  I should always be living a life that reflects Who
my Master is.  People should be able to see Jesus, the Master and Teacher, in
and through my actions of caring and sharing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                To me, this means I should use the gifts and
talents GOD has given me – such as the ability to communicate, the ability to
be compassionate – and reach out to others so that they may know that their GOD
loves them and cares for them even more than my actions imply.  I am to use my
GOD-given talents for the furthering of the Gospel – the announcement of GOD’s
presence in the lives of people.  My actions should always point to the GOD Who
wants to deepen a relationship with each and every person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                If I keep my eyes focused on the Master, it
will be a lot easier for me to serve others and not seek my own honor.  For I
will always rejoice when others come to know the Master better, and I will be
happy that I am being a useful tool in the Master’s hands.  Then, when I do
rite (ritual), it will be more meaningful because I have done right work
(positive actions of service).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Have I sometimes
talked the talk without walking the walk?  What aspects of my life do I still
need to work on so that I might be more like the Master-Teacher?  Whom might
the Lord Jesus be calling me to serve today?  This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and
caring.  Through Your GOoDness, You sent Your Son, Jesus, to live among us and
to announce Your love and concern for all individuals.  He came as the One Who
serves, even though He is one with You and deserves to be praised and served
together with You.  He, the Master-Teacher, has given us an example of how Your
GOoD News can be made present in the lives of others.  Jesus has invited us to
share in His ministry of service.  By His loving acts of service, He has taught
us that we are called to serve others.  We are grateful for the opportunity to
be able to reflect Your love and the Master’s love for others.  May we always
help others in a way in which they come to know You and Your Son better and
seek to deepen their relationship with You and Your Son, in union with the Holy
Spirit.  Help us to humbly use the talents and abilities You have given us. 
And may we continue to give glory and praise to You, Your Son, and the Holy
Spirit.  For this we pray in the name of Jesus, our Master-Teacher, the Role
Model of Service, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solemnity of St. Joseph</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Replacing Wed. of 2nd Week of Lent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Joseph, Husband of Mary: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-joseph-husband-of-mary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   2 Samuel 7: 4-5a, 12-14a, 16;       Psalm 89:
2-3, 4-5, 27 and 29;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                      Romans 4: 13, 16-18, 22;             
Matthew 1: 16, 18-21, 24a    or     Luke 2: 41-51a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today we celebrate the Solemnity of St.
Joseph, Spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  We only have a little glimpse of
this “just” man from scriptures.  A few passages in Matthew’s Gospel, a little
in Luke’s Gospel, and that’s about it.  Yet, a lot can be gleaned for our
reflection from these passages and today’s other readings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                2 Samuel 7 is GOD’s promise to continue the
line of David.  From that line would come a descendant who will be in special
relationship with GOD and rule GOD’s people.  It was from the lineage of David
that Joseph came.  Joseph extended the line to his wife’s Child, Jesus, the One
truly beloved by GOD the Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Psalm 89 echoes this same theme in speaking
about the promise made to David – that his throne would be established for all
generations and one of his descendants would call GOD Abi – “My Abba” or “My
Father,” thus implying a close relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                St. Paul, in the passage from his letter to
the Romans, speaks about the faith of Abraham and how all people would be
blessed through Abraham and his descendants.  Faith was one of the hallmarks of
St. Joseph.  He was a descendant of Abraham not just through blood, but also, and
more importantly, through faith.  And just as Abraham’s faith was credited to
him as justice, so Joseph’s faith is what makes Joseph just and righteous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The Gospel account from Matthew speaks about
Joseph’s dilemma when he finds out that Mary is with child.  According to the
law, Joseph could and should have had Mary stoned.  Being a just and upright
individual and perceiving Mary to be a decent and holy woman, Joseph decides to
send her away quietly and not expose her to the harsh treatment of the law.  It
is then revealed to him in a dream that Mary has conceived by the power of the
Holy Spirit and Joseph is asked to care for Mary and her Child.  Joseph takes
her into his home and cares for her and the soon-to-be-born Child.  Joseph is
seen protecting them during their flight to Egypt and in Luke’s Gospel during
the childhood and early life of Jesus.  We also pick up that Joseph shared his
trade of carpentry, or building, with Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the passage from Luke’s Gospel, we see
how Jesus’ being lost in the Temple was of great concern for both Mary and
Joseph.  They had been searching for Him and did not find Him until the third
day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                What makes Joseph a role model is his faith
that leads him to live his life as a person who is “just” in GOD’s eyes.  He
believes GOD, and he trusts that GOD is in control.  It is hard for him to deal
with all that is happening in his life, but trust he does.  He senses the
specialness of Jesus, and Joseph is willing to do what he is called to do for
Jesus and Mary.  He seems the strong, silent type.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I have had a image of him in another man
named Joseph – my father.   He was the one in the background who did what was
asked of him and supported the family.  He gave love not only to his family,
but to all who came under his roof, or the roof he was under.  My father was a
man of faith who worked with wood, and he sought to do GOD’s will, even when
things did not seem to be following the ordinary plans of life.  I remember how
I used to celebrate this feast of St. Joseph (and the other feast of St. Joseph
on May 1), by talking with Dad and thanking him for being the Joseph in my
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                One of my favorite songs about St. Joseph is
the one entitled Joseph’s Song.  I have used it a few times to demonstrate the
questions that probably ran through Joseph’s mind, and yet, to show his
willingness to be faithful to the call GOD gave him to care for the Child Whom
he knew was the Son of GOD.  [See Song of the Day below for a link to the
song.]  The song reflects the faith that Joseph had at the awesome events that
happened in his life, and the faith Joseph had – faith to trust that GOD would
help him through the challenging aspects of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In all the readings on this Solemnity of St.
Joseph, the challenge I see for me is how can I deepen my faith.  Faith is much
more than intellectual agreement to a list of statements.  Faith is a
relationship with Jesus, His Abba-Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit. 
Faith is what led Joseph to take care of Mary and the Child Whom she would
bear.  For Joseph, faith meant accepting GOD’s plan even when it did not make
sense to him from a human standpoint.  Faith empowered Joseph to deepen his
relationship with Mary, with Jesus, and with GOD in heaven.  His faith and
trust in GOD brought him to justice and let him experience salus (healing,
salvation) that GOD was extending to him in and through his Care – Jesus.  He
truly responded to the gifts that GOD had given him.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I am called to walk in and by faith, the
same type of faith that Joseph had.  There are times when I do not see why
things are happening.  It is then that I need to trust GOD and seek to do what
I believe GOD is calling me to do.  I am called to rely on my relationship with
GOD and that relationship will see me through the trying times.  And if I am
willing to trust that GOD is working in my life, I will experience the
salvation and love that GOD is giving me in and through Jesus the Christ.  I
will be able to look up at Jesus on the wood of the cross and know that I have
salus (healing and salvation) – not because of who I am or what I do, but
because of my relationship with the One Who has saved me, and not only me, but
also all those who put their faith in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I respond to
GOD when I am faced with challenges that seem beyond my grasp and ability? 
Whom has GOD entrusted to my care and how can I care for that/those person(s),
trusting that GOD will guide me to do what the Lord Jesus wants me to do?  Who
has been a Joseph to me – the strong silent type, who guides and instructs me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever close and
yet mysterious.  Through Your GOoDness, You ask us to put our faith in You and
Your Son.  Life is not always easy for us to understand.  Things do not always
fall into place as we would want them to, but we are limited in our vision and
cannot see as You see.  You ask us to look to those people of faith who have
gone before us – Abraham, Moses, David, Mary, and Joseph.  They were asked to
trust that You would keep Your promise to bring salus to Your people – the
people who trust You and desire to deepen their relationship with You.  You
call us to look up to Jesus, lifted on the wood of the cross, and realize that
true life comes from His suffering, death, and resurrection.  You continue to
offer us healing and restoration, if we turn away from our sinfulness and trust
in You.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, give us the strength and wisdom
we need to put our faith in You and Your Son.  May we be able to experience
Your presence with us as we face the unexplainable happenings in our lives,
knowing that Your plan is beyond our limited view.  We give You thanks and
praise as we continue our journey of faith, for You are our GOD.  We make this
prayer in and through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of Second Week of Lent              </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Salvator of Horta:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-salvator-of-horta</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Jeremiah 17: 5-10;                       Psalm 1:
1-2, 3, 4 and 6;                     Luke 16: 19-31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                “In what do we trust?”  Trust is the ability
to sink our roots down deep to where we can draw life-giving nourishment, even
in the midst of dry and barren times, such as many have experienced over these
past few years.  Jeremiah and the Responsorial Psalm use the image of a tree
that is planted where it can sink its roots down deep.  In the Gospel, Jesus
relates the story of Lazarus who trusted in GOD even while starving outside a
rich person’s house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the First Reading, Jeremiah says if our
trust is only in other humans or pleasures, but not in the LORD, we will end up
producing nothing worthwhile.  If our trust is in GOD, we will produce
abundantly even during dry and trying times.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The Responsorial Psalm echoes this message,
comparing those who trust in GOD to trees planted near running water.  Even
though harsh, dry weather may come, the trees bear fruit and never wither away
since their roots are deep into that which produces life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the Gospel, Jesus shares the parable of
Lazarus and the rich man.  Although the story is familiar, it still bears
listening to it, again and again.  The rich man is not named, but the poor man
is called Lazarus.  The rich man (sometimes referred to as “Dives” meaning
“Riches”) probably worked hard to gain his wealth and position in life.  He
earned his feasting.  His sin was not the fact that he was rich.  His sin was
his not being willing to share “even the scraps” with the poor.  Lazarus, on
the other hand, seems to have trusted in GOD.  GOD reverses the conditions in
the eternal scope of events.  Lazarus rests on the bosom of Abraham while the
rich man suffers in torment.  Lazarus cannot help the rich man (by quenching
his thirst) nor the rich man’s relatives (by warning them of the dangers that
would befall them if they do not repent and become generous and concerned for
the poor).  Abraham even says, “If they do not listen to Moses and the
prophets, they will not be convinced even if one should rise from the dead.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Where do you find yourself in these
scripture passages?  In what do you trust?  It is easy for us to put our hope
in what we earn from a worldly standpoint.  We believe if we work hard, we
should be able to enjoy the results of our labors.  If we are doing well, we
chalk it up to our abilities.  Yet, the challenge is to do our best, and to
trust that GOD will take care of us.  We pray the Lord’s Prayer so often, but
do we really ask GOD to give us each day only what we need for that day, and
that day only?  We often trust in other people and our own power more than we
trust in GOD.  Hope in GOD is what will see us through the dry and barren
days.  Hoping in GOD is like the roots that run deep down to the flowing
stream.  If our roots (hope/trust) are shallow, we will not be able to weather
the tough times.  We will wither up and be useless or be destroyed by the wind
or floods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I was reminded of this analogy of a plant
that sinks deep roots down to the source of water some years ago when I was
with our sixth-grade students in Joshua Tree National Park in the Mojave
Desert.  Although it had rained a few days before we arrived, the “wadi”
[Hebrew for “dry riverbed”] or “arroyo seco” [Spanish for “dry river”] was dry
and water-free.  Yet all around the wadi-arroyo seco there were lush, green
plants and vegetation.  These plants had roots that sank deep into the desert
sand and tapped into the water that had seeped into the ground.  Therefore,
these hardy trees and bushes could withstand a lengthy period of dryness until
the next rain came.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As we face trying and difficult times, we
may be tempted to identify ourselves with Lazarus.  We trust in GOD and are
willing to do what we must do in order to right injustices.  Other people may
see us more as the rich one (dives) who pushes others around and who is not
interested in the poor, the little ones, who are hungry at our door.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Where is our value system?  Are we acting
with the right purpose?  That is something about which each and every one must
pray and reflect.  We must also trust in the Lord Jesus and His divine guidance
not only for us individually, but for the communities in which we live.  We
must pray that all of us realize that GOD is our only savior, liberator, and
source of safety.  Ultimate victory will not be the result of safety devices
and alarms, having a can of mace, or a stashed supply of money or paper goods. 
Ultimate victory is only in and through the one Savior, Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The more we trust in GOD, the more we will
be willing to face trying times, and the more we will also be willing to share with
others, for we know that GOD will take care of us even more generously than we
care for others.  Oh, it may not seem so now, but in the final scene (as
Lazarus experienced with Abraham), we will experience the fullness of GOD’s
loving care.  And we should be motivated not by fear of what will happen to us
if we don’t care for others.  Our motivation should come from our experience of
trusting in GOD and knowing GOD loves us and cares for us with an everlasting
love and care, just as GOD loves all people, especially the poor who trust in
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As I reflect on these passages, I am
challenged to look at my life.  There are times when I have trusted more in
others and myself than I have in the Lord Jesus.  I thought that I had to do it
on my own or with the help of a close friend/relative.  I have worried when I
did not know how things would work out.  In such situations I lost my focus on
GOD’s presence in my life.  When that happened, I literally made myself sick
with fear of the worst.  And yet, if I look back with the eyes of faith, I can
see GOD’s hand at work even when I doubted and felt hopeless.  GOD was trying
to speak comforting, yet challenging, words to me.  I just needed to stop and
sense GOD’s hand on my shoulders.  When I did, the problems did not disappear
immediately, but they were put into proper focus, and I could see light at the
end of the dark path.  I also realized that if I continue to sink my roots
deeply into the Source of Life-giving “Water” (that is, Jesus), I will be
better prepared to weather the dry and barren days in my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is the basis
for my trust?  Am I “rooted” in the Lord Jesus, especially during those dry and
barren moments?  How can I manifest my trust in GOD more?  What can I do to
help others who are going through rough times and need to be encouraged to
trust in the Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever-present. 
Through Your GOoDness, You ask us to trust in You and in Your Son rather than
put our hope in mere mortal power and earthly wealth.  You continue to reveal
Your love for us in and through Your Son, Jesus.  He not only shared parables
to help us understand Your eternal love for us, but He also lived a life of
complete trust in You.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, continue to
strength our trust in You.  Give us the heart to share with others what You
have given us.  Help us to see Your plan being manifested in our everyday
life.  Continue to reassure us of Your presence with us as we are challenged by
the various trials that come our way.  We pray this in and through Your Son,
Jesus our Lord and Savior, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of Second Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed John of Parma:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-john-of-parma</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Genesis 37: 3-4, 12-13a, 17b-28a;      Psalm 105:
16-17, 18-19, 20-21;      Matthew 21: 33-43, 45-46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD can make GOoD things happen even from the evil plots of
humans.  Our First Reading relates how Joseph’s brothers plot against him.  The
Responsorial Psalm describes how GOD used the events in Joseph’s life for the
GOoD of the children of Israel.  In the Gospel, Jesus relates a parable that
foretells how He will be persecuted by the religious leaders of His day, but it
will lead to the greatest GOoD of all – the salvation of all who accept the
gift of eternal life He offers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading today relates part of the story of
Joseph.  We hear how Joseph is despised by his brothers because he is favored
by their father (Jacob-Israel), and he speaks about his brothers becoming
subservient to him.  The brothers make plans to kill him, and they end up
selling him for twenty pieces of silver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm response recalls another aspect of the story of
Joseph – his living as a slave in Egypt, but his being raised to a position in
which he brought wholeness and life to his family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Jesus tells a parable of a property
owner who leases his land to tenants who attack and kill the owner’s servants,
and eventually, they even the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>owner’s son.  Jesus directs this story at the chief priests
and the leaders of the Jewish community, thus predicting that they will
persecute Him and yet the richness of GOD will be given to others because of
what GOD allows the religious leaders of the people to do to Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the Word of GOD today, I recall all the
parallels between Joseph and Jesus.  Both were the favored sons of their
fathers.  Both were despised by other members of their people.  Both had
visions of how they would lead others to a better life.  Both had death plots
planned against them.  Both were sold by the people close to them for pieces of
silver.  Joseph and Jesus were both imprisoned because of false witnesses. 
Both gave hope to those who were oppressed.  Both brought wholeness and life to
others by being raised up to positions of glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joseph’s life, in many aspects, points to that of Jesus. 
Out of what seemed like impossible conditions, Joseph brought salus (salvation,
health, well-being) to his people.  Jesus brought true spiritual salvation
through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My pondering made me think of a conversation I had with a
friend.  This person was experiencing all sorts of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>difficulties:  family problems, financial issues, relational
problems.   Everything seemed to be going against this individual.  The
situation seemed gloomy.  Yet, throughout it all, this person held to hope and
faith in GOD.  It was hard to see any light at the end of the dark tunnel.  It
was hard to understand how so many problems could affect an individual who, I
believed, was really trying to live a Christian life, being faithful to the
Gospel, reaching out in love and care as Jesus wished.  I asked the individual
if there were any positive aspects to what was happening.  I was told of some
little, occasional signs of affirmation and encouragement – a smile and a
positive word from a child, a friend’s willingness to spend time helping, a
quiet moment of reflection in the midst of hectic schedule.  Many people have
had similar experiences over the past few of years with pandemic, the conflict
in Ukraine, violence against innocent people, all leading to higher costs for
gas, food, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realized that GOD had given us examples throughout
scripture of the difficult times of those who are called by GOD to do GOD’s
will (which actually describes all of us at different times and in different
ways during our lives).  And it was often through the most trying time that GOD
brought about the great revelation of the divine </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>plan.  GOD reassures us that even in our darkest moments,
the Lord Jesus is with us and if we hold firm to our faith, GOD will allow
great things to happen through us for the sake of others and ourselves.  Yes,
we may be despised by others because of our vision of GOD’s ultimate plan.  We
may face trying times and feel oppressed and rejected by others.  Yet, in the
end, if we remain faithful, GOD will raise us up and make our experiences a
blessing not only for us, but also for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago, the book club to which I belong read the
book, The Shack.  Sometime later, I watch the movie with the same title and
portraying the major parts of the book.  What struck me is how “Papa” (Abba-
Father) reassured “Mac” how Papa, Jesus, and the Spirit were always with Mac
during the most difficult times, even when Mac felt abandoned by GOD.  It was
very touching to see GOD reassuring Mac of divine love even at the most trying
points of Mac’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>None of us likes to have difficult times.  Yet GOD is saying
to us, “I will be with you through those times,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and I will lift you up and will eventually bring healing not
only to you, but also to others, if you remain faithful to Me.  I will bring
GOoD out of the apparent bad.”  We should be encouraged that GOD is with us
during hard times, just as GOD was with Joseph.  We should realize that living
a Christian (Christ-like) life will include times of suffering and
difficulties, since Jesus, the Son of GOD, also faced suffering and difficulties. 
We should not go out and seek problems, but realize when trying times come our
way, that we are in company with the holy, faith- filled people, like Joseph,
and especially like Jesus, the GOD-man Who came and lived among us.  Yes, GOD
promises to be with us and give us eternal life, yet, we may have to travel the
bumpy and rugged road to get there.  GOD will not leave us alone.  The Lord
Jesus will be with us and will use our struggles to manifest the divine plan
for us and for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What experiences in
my life are/were the most challenging? How have I experienced the presence of
GOD in those trying times? What GOoD came out of my trusting GOD and
persevering through the difficult situation(s)? How can I encourage others who
are experiencing rough times?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and always present. 
Through Your GOoDness, You ask us to follow Your Son.  Sometimes the path we
are asked to take seems dark and burdensome.  We encounter all sorts of
obstacles along the way.  We are tempted to give up hope.  Yet You remind us,
especially as we reflect on Your story of salvation in Your Word, that You are
with us.  You reassure us of Your ultimate victory and fullness of life if we
continue to place our trust in You.  You transform our suffering to be part of
Your plan of salvation not only for our GOoD, but also for the GOoD of others. 
Your Son allows us to share in His life, His suffering, and His death.  He also
promises to give us a share in His resurrection.  Through the power of Your
Holy Spirit, help us to be mindful of Your promises.  Give us the strength we
need to remain steadfast.  Fill us with the awareness of Your presence.  Allow
us to be sources of encouragement to others as they travel along the rough
roads of their lives.  Help us always to keep our eyes focused on what lies
ahead – eternal life with You.  We pray this through Christ Jesus, Your Son</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and our Brother, Who has gone before us to lead us and guide</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us, Who encourages us and blesses us along the way, for He
is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and He is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of the Second Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Nicholas Owen: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-nicholas-owen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Micah 7: 14-15, 18-20;         Psalm 103: 1-2,
3-4, 9-10, 11-12;         Luke 15: 1-3, 11-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The merciful and forgiving nature of GOD takes center place
in our readings today. The prayer of Micah seeks GOD’s loving kindness upon
those who sin (that would include all of us). The Responsorial proclaims that
GOD is kind and merciful. In the Gospel, Jesus relates a parable that is quite
familiar to most people. He uses the parable to explain His mission to the
sinful people who seek to return to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Micah speaks to the GOD of Israel in the hearing
of the remnant of Israel (those left behind after some of Micah’s fellow
citizens have been taken away in exile). To those who listen, the prayer is a
reminder that GOD is a forgiving GOD. Not only is GOD willing to forgive, but
once GOD has forgiven, GOD completely forgets the sins by throwing them into
the depths of the sea, the old dumping ground for things that should be
discarded and never brought up (or surface) again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm echoes this same theme by saying that
GOD pardons all our iniquities and does not hold the divine wrath forever. The
psalm continues by saying that GOD does not deal with us as our sins deserve
but puts our transgressions far from us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus relates the story of the Prodigal
Son in response to the Pharisees and scribes who are murmuring about His eating
with sinners. This parable is the third of three parables in the fifteenth
chapter of St. Luke’s Gospel, all showing how Jesus and His Abba-Father rejoice
when a sinful individual turns away from sin and turns back to GOD (metanoia ad
Deum [a mixture of Greek and Latin words]) and how GOD is willing to seek out
the lost and welcome the wayward back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am once again
impressed by the unconditional, loving forgiveness that GOD has for sinners
(including you and me). I remember thinking of my impression of GOD as a child.
I then pictured GOD as a strict disciplinarian who kept an exact record of all
my wrongdoings. According to my childhood understanding, I would eventually
have to pay dearly for all of my sins, even after I had received GOD’s
forgiveness, for in my mind, GOD recorded every one of my sins in a demerit
book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The image in today’s readings is far from that which I had
as a youngster. GOD is pictured as anxiously waiting for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>each sinner to turn back to GOD Who is loving and forgiving.
Once a sinner begins to turn toward GOD (ad Deum), GOD rushes toward the sinner
(Gospel), forgives the sins (Responsorial), and casts the sins into the
irrecoverable depths of the sea (First Reading). GOD then throws a party to
celebrate the return of wayward offspring (Gospel).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recall a Catechist Formation class I taught in which we
had the catechists role </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>played this parable of the Prodigal. I think everyone was
able to identify and really get into the roles of the characters. This story
gives us the opportunity to look at our own lives and see with which character
we most identify. As we review the parable, some of us can easily see ourselves
as the younger sibling who takes advantage of the benevolence (prodigal
kindness) of the loving parent. We take whatever we can and then go and do our
own thing in a prodigal (excessive) way. We live life the way we want, even
though we know it hurts our loving Parent. Often things do not turn out as we expect
and we come upon hard times, having to do the worst of jobs (feeding pigs for a
Jew was highly despicable, since pigs were considered unclean, physically and
metaphysically) in order to just squeak out an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>existence, not even eating as well as the animals we are
feeding. It is then that we come to our senses and realize how GOoD we had it
back in the house of our loving Parent. We think that if we return, admit our
wrongdoing, and ask to be treated not as an offspring of our loving Parent, but
as a slave, we would have it better off than living in abject poverty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others of us can probably identify with the lovingly
prodigal (excessive) parent. We have given of ourselves and our riches and have
been rejected and treated in an abusive way by those whom we have loved.
Although we have not approved of the actions taken by our loved ones, we allow
them the freedom to waste their lives. We mourn their choices in life. We are
willing to welcome them back, if and when they turn to us. We anxiously look
for them to return to us. If they are willing to return, we are more than
anxious to restore them to the fullness of our prodigal (lavish) love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of us may be a little like the loving parent in the
story, but we are not quite so willing to throw a party when our wayward loved
ones return. We may want them to suffer a little longer, in order to teach them
a lesson. It might be hard for us to fully identify with the loving and
forgiving and prodigally (excessively and lavishly) loving parent as described
by Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still others of us can really identify with the older
sibling. We have always tried to do the right thing. We have not caused undue
heartache for those who love us. We expect someday to be rewarded for our
proper behavior. Then our  wayward sibling returns, and a party is thrown for
the one who has prodigally (excessively) squandered all of the inheritance
given to them. We are tempted to let that no GOoD “@#!$!*!” have a piece of our
mind. How could our excessively loving parent throw a party for that one after
all that one has done? We are angry. We have a right to be angry, at least we
think we do. After all we have always done the right thing, and we don’t have a
party thrown for us. We are jealous of the generosity and forgiveness of our
prodigally loving parent. We are really upset with our wayward sibling, for all
the heartaches and pain that one has caused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How can that one be forgiven, and how come we don’t get a
party for all the right things we have done? We are prodigally (excessively)
angry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some of us, we may particularly find it difficult to be
understanding and forgiving of those who have terrorized us and others. We want
the worst (prodigal - excessive) pain and suffering for those who have been
unmerciful to others and inflicted all sorts of hardships on others. We find it
hard to reach out with a handshake of peace to our enemies. We want the death
penalty, not forgiveness for such persons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No matter where we see ourselves in this story, Jesus is
telling us that we need to realize our own missing the mark (sin). Jesus is
saying that our loving Abba-GOD-Parent is willing to forgive us, if we but turn
around toward GOD (metanoia ad Deum). As soon as we start straightening out our
path and heading back to the Lord Jesus, GOD will rush towards us and give us a
prodigal (lavish) abundance of the divine richness. The Lord Jesus will rejoice
that we are re-aligning ourselves toward GOD. This is true if we have totally
gone against GOD (a-theos) (like the younger</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sibling) or just missed the target a little (like the older
sibling) in forgetting how much GOD loves us and how much GOD is there for us.
It also is a challenge for us to look at our relationship with others. We are
called both to be sincere in our seeking reconciliation with others and also to
be generous in our forgiving of those who have hurt us. Prodigal (excessive)
forgiveness as portrayed in today’s readings is hallmark of Christian
relationships – relationship with GOD and relationship with others. Seeking
forgiveness is the honest admission of our wrongdoing, our sinfulness, our
missing the mark. Sharing in forgiveness is the willingness to rejoice at the
reconciliation of those who have been estranged, the forgetting of the wrong
deeds, and the full restoration of the broken relationship with even more
prodigal (lavish) joy and life than before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  At this point in my
life, with which character in the Gospel parable do I most identify? Why? In
what way do I feel challenged by reflecting on this parable? How can I
demonstrate my sense of appreciation for receiving GOD’s loving mercy, not only
for me but also for others? How can I bring this message of a prodigally
(lavishly) loving GOD to those with whom I come in contact?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and forgiving.
Through Your GOoDness, You treat us, Your wayward sons and daughters, better
than we can ever expect to be treated. We have all strayed from the true path
to You as we have journeyed along. We have sometimes fully turned our back on
You, and yet, You anxiously have been waiting for our return to You. You are
willing to bestow on us prodigal (lavish) riches beyond our understanding, if
we but turn to You. You also ask us to rejoice with You when others turn back
to You. Help us to overcome our jealousy for the late returners. May we treat
them with the same prodigal (excessive) graciousness that You have treated us.
Give us the loving heart to be able to forget the hurt that others have caused
us and move on with the joy of being reunited with others in Your presence. 
Help us to pray for the return of all those who have forsaken You. Give us the
patience and understanding to realize that You love all sinners, even the most
despicable, while hating the sin they commit. Through the power of Your Holy
Spirit, help us to work for reconciliation and spiritual return of all people. 
We pray this through Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, The One Who has
taken away our sins through His death and resurrection and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Third Sunday in Lent - “C” Cycle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Toribio de Mogrovejo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Exodus 3: 1-8a, 13-15;      Psalm 103: 1-2, 3-4,
6-7, 8,11;      1 Corinthians 10: 1-6, 10-12;      Luke 13: 1-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The kindness, mercy, compassion, and forgiveness of GOD is a
central theme in our readings today.  [As I wrote the first sentence, I debated
whether to use the single verb “is” or the plural verb “are” since the subject
of the sentence (“kindness, mercy, compassion, and forgiveness of GOD”) could
be taken as four separate nouns.  So, really they are so essentially the
“single subject” of Who GOD is, together they are the essence of GOD, so I
purposely used the verb “is.”]  The Hebrew word for this essence of GOD is
[c]hesed.  It is somewhat equivalent to the Greek word agape.  [Please see the
Website of the Day for more information about this essence of GOD The Hebrew
word, [c]hesed, combines all these terms into one word.]   In the First
Reading, GOD reveals the divine essence (by revealing the divine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>name) to Moses in response to the suffering being inflicted
upon GOD’s Chosen People in Egypt.  The response for the psalm repeats the
phrase: “The Lord is kind and merciful.” In our Second Reading from his First
Letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul reminds them (and us) that they must learn
a lesson from their ancestors in faith who experienced GOD’s merciful action in
the Exodus, but who sinned against a loving and compassionate GOD.  The Gospel
presents two reminders of GOD’s mercy:  first, Jesus tells His disciples that
evils that happen to people are not the result of GOD wanting to punish
sinners, and secondly, Jesus relates the parable of the fig-tree gardener who
begs for another chance to do all that he can to enable a barren fig tree to
bear GOoD fruit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading (from Exodus) is a familiar passage to
most believers.  Most are aware that GOD appeared to Moses in the burning bush
in the desert.  People are often aware that this is the first time GOD reveals
the divine name YHWH to humans.  GOD is allowing mortals to have an intimate
way of relating to GOD. Being able to call someone by name means that one has a
privileged way of communicating with the person.  This name (YHWH) is so holy
and powerful,the Chosen People do not feel comfortable voicing, so they
substitute the word Adonai – the LORD.  The name YHWH is, however, not just a
name, but also and more importantly, the name reveals Who GOD is.  GOD is
fundamentally a GOD of being, a GOD of presence, a GOD of active relationship
with mortals.  And the foremost way that GOD is present with those whom GOD has
created is the compassionate and merciful way GOD relates to them.  GOD is
first and foremost a Being of kindness and mercy.  GOD is not just a Divine
Being Who is far away and distant from those who call upon GOD, whether or not
the people use a name for GOD.  GOD is aware of the plight of all, especially
those who invoke GOD’s help.  And GOD actively responds with eternal mercy and
compassion. This GOD is GOD Who Is for others.  This is part of what the divine
name implies, and it is how the people need to relate to this GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial reminds us of the essential nature of GOD,
that of being merciful, kind, and compassionate. The psalm gives us a way to
respond to such a GOD.   Because our GOD is so concerned and proactive in
relating to those who call upon the name of the LORD, the people must bless
(“speak well”) GOD’s holy name (YHWH – LORD) with all their being (mind, body,
heart, and soul). By the people’s recalling (remembering – zikaron) GOD’s
merciful action and compassionate presence with them, GOD is present again and
continues the divine, loving actions in their presence. GOD is known for the
majestic deeds of GOoDness and the reluctant ways GOD displays the divine
anger.  GOD is more willing to forgive and give more chances to the sinful and
disobedient, than GOD is willing to exact punishment. Thus, the LORD wants to
allow the errant/sinful individuals yet another opportunity to turn again to
GOD (ad Deum).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul uses an analogy to remind
the new Chosen People (those who are in relationship with GOD through the Lord
Jesus) that they must not just rely on the fact that they have become
beneficiaries of GOD’s loving compassion through water (baptism) and eating of
the spiritual food (Eucharist). He recalls how all the Israelites at the time
of Moses received the living water from the Rock and were given the manna in
the desert.  GOD had taken care of all the people whom the LORD GOD had led out
of Egypt.  Yet even though GOD daily provided for their needs, they still
sinned – turned away from GOD (a theos). Paul urges those who have been set
free from sin, not to fall into the same pattern as the sinful Israelites of
old who sometimes forgot how kind and merciful the LORD GOD had been with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus addresses His disciples with messages
of GOD’s universal mercy in two ways:  relating “news” items of the day, and
telling a story (parable).  First, He recalls events that were in the present
consciousness of His listeners. Only in Luke’s Gospel do we hear of the two
dramatic events that are presented in today’s pericope:  Pilate’s mixing human
blood with the blood of sacrifice and the deaths of people by the tumbling
tower of  Siloam.  Jesus uses these tragic events to say that GOD did not cause
these events to punish sinners.  Obviously if GOD was going to punish sinners,
a lot more people (in fact all the people) would have had to undergo similar
experiences because all mortals are sinners (with Jesus and His mother
excepted).  Jesus emphasizes the fact that GOD does not cause terrible things
to happen as a result of the sinfulness of individuals. GOD does not seek to
punish evil doers in this life-time, but desires that all repent and turn
back.  Jesus urges His disciples to repent (metanoia – turn back to GOD [ad Deum]). 
The ultimate punishment after death will be a worse than the fate experienced
by those who went through the tragic events that Jesus reported earlier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second part of today’s Gospel is a parable that
proclaims GOD’s mercy.  Just as the gardener seeks another chance to promote
the barren fig tree’s production of fruit, so the Lord Jesus desires to give
yet another opportunity to those who are producing no fruit (sinning, thus
producing no GOoD fruit).  Jesus stresses that the merciful and compassionate
GOD (Whom Jesus calls Abba- Father) is willing to provide the fruitless
(sinners) yet another occasion to produce some GOoD fruit.  Carrying the
parable further, Jesus could be compared to the gardener who begs for one more
year of hard work on the part of the gardener himself.  Jesus desires to do all
He can to cultivate growth.  He is willing to fertilize the ground with His
very being in order to give nutrients to the unproductive tree so that it will
produce GOoD fruit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am once again awestruck by
the compassion and mercy of GOD.  GOD is quintessentially a GOD of
relationship, not just within the GODhead, but also with all creation.  GOD’s
merciful love reached out to create the world. GOD’s will is that all enjoy a relationship
– an eternal relationship – with divine.  GOD has done and continues to do
everything possible (with the exception of taking away the divine gift of free
will) to invite, exhort, encourage a relationship between us and GOD.  GOD is
willing to forgive and give another chance to those who refuse to have a
relationship with the LORD GOD.  It is because of this great loving and
compassionate attitude of GOD that the Son came to share our humanity – in
order to allow us the best opportunity to be in relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, like our ancestors in faith, we have forgotten the
wonderful deeds of our GOD.  We have failed to remember how GOD has washed us
clean and fed us with living water and the food for our spiritual journey.  We
have turned away from GOD (a theos) – we have sinned.  GOD, however, does not
desire to leave us in our sinful state.  Jesus has come to cultivate growth so
that we might manifest the GOoD fruit that GOD wants us to produce.  Jesus has
fertilized the area around us with His going into the ground (His death) and
allowing new growth to come forth (His resurrection). He has tilled and aerated
(breathed life-giving divine air) into us by the sending of His Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father are willing to do
whatever is needed in order that we come to an awareness that GOD is the Being
of Ultimate Presence and Relationship. Yet, because GOD desires only a freely
chosen relationship, GOD will not force us to be in that divine relationship.
For coercion is not love.  The Lord Jesus wants us to freely love GOD with our
whole being – to be always heading toward GOD (ad Deum), not just at this
moment of our life, but forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our repentance (seeking GOD’s forgiveness, turning back to
GOD [ad Deum] – metanoia) can be spurred on by our remembering (zikaron) what
GOD has done (and is still doing and will continue to do) for us.  We should
desire to produce the best fruit possible not to earn GOD’s love, since that is
already a given, but as our response to the compassionate love that GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continues to pour out upon us.  We should seek the GOD “Who
Is for us” (YHWH).  Our response should resonate with the psalmist today: 
“Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all my being, bless GOD’s holy name (YHWH). 
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all GOD’s benefits.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How do I personally
relate to this GOD Who Is, and Who desires to have a relationship with me? Do I
take time to reflect and remember how this GOD has done, continues to do, and
will do, GOoD deeds for all creatures, including me? Do I bless GOD’s holy name
by using GOD’s name only in prayerful and loving way? How have I experienced
the compassionate and merciful presence of GOD in my life?  How can I help
others to be more open to GOD’s loving presence in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the GOD of Being for us.  Through
Your GOoDness, You desire that we be in relationship with You. You continue to
manifest Your compassionate and merciful presence through the multitude of
experiences You allow us to have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You touch our lives with signs of Your loving presence. 
Yet, we often forget those manifestations of Your love and focus only on the
negative and mere earthly happenings in our lives.  So, in the fullness of
time, You sent Your Son to share our humanity and be Your Incarnate Presence
among us.  Through His life, ministry, death and resurrection, Jesus continued
to draw people into a closer relationship with Himself and You.  Through the
continued presence of Your Holy Spirit, we are reminded of the GOoD News that
Jesus proclaimed. We ask that You continue to extend Your eternal mercy and
kindness to us, especially when we have turned away from You through our sins. 
Help us to re-orient our lives so that they are heading toward You.  We make
this prayer of praise and glory to You in union with our Master-Teacher and
Savior, Jesus, Who has died, is risen, and is living and reigning with You and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Holy Spirit, our one and only, loving and merciful, GOD,
forever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third Sunday in Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Toribius de Mogrovejo:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:    Exodus: 17: 3-7;       Psalm 95: 1-2, 6-7,
8-9;        Romans 5: 1-2, 5-8;         John 4: 5-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Water.  Life-giving water.  Ever flowing water.  Water, as
seen in today’s readings, reminds us of the gift of faith. Let us dive into the
waters of faith and see how refreshing they can be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account in the First Reading takes place in the desert. 
The Israelites are complaining about being out in the hot, dry desert with no
water.  While they were slaves in Egypt, they had been able to drink their fill
of water from the Nile River that flowed through the land.  Now they blame
Moses – and GOD – for leading them away from the life-giving waters to the
parched land in the desert.  Moses prays to GOD and GOD gives them water
flowing from the rock, not because of their faith in GOD, but because of their
lack of faith.  GOD gifts them, even though they do not deserve GOD’s gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm response challenges us not to test GOD and show
lack of faith as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people did in the desert.  If we believe, GOD will give us
what we need.  And then we can sing a joyful song to the LORD. In the Second
Reading, in his letter to the Romans, St. Paul speaks about faith.  Faith comes
to us as GOD’s gift in Jesus (“Through Jesus we have gained access by faith”). 
Jesus gives us this gift of life-giving faith while we are yet sinners – not
faithful individuals – but enemies of GOD.  Jesus lays downs His life so we
might come to know fully the gift of faith that is being offered to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The long Gospel of Jesus’ meeting the woman at the well
speaks of water and faith.  Jesus reaches out to the woman.  He begins the
life- giving conversation that will end, not only in her own belief in GOD and
in Jesus, but also in many others coming to believe.  It truly shocks the woman
that Jesus would talk to her because 1) she is a Samaritan, 2) she is a woman,
and 3) she is an outcast even among the other Samaritan women.  (She is not
allowed to come with the other women to draw water because of her lifestyle. 
The other women come in the early morning, but this woman has to come by
herself during the hot noon hour.)   Yet this is the one Jesus invites to
believe in Him and to spread the faith to other women, other Samaritans, other
people. Jesus asks for water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He wants the woman to respond to His request.  Jesus then
invites her to receive the living (flowing) water that He offers.  She thinks
that Jesus is talking about another source of drinking water that is not as
deep as Jacob’s well. She wants this flowing water, so she does not have to
keep coming, by herself, to draw water.  Jesus is speaking of a spiritual water
that gives spiritual life.  Jesus is offering to her the gift of faith.  It is
only as the conversation develops that she becomes aware of the other dimension
of Jesus’ promise of living water.  After Jesus shows that He is aware of who
she really is and how she has lived her life to this point, it is then that she
begins to realize that Jesus is the promised Messiah.  She accepts Jesus’
invitation to draw from the well of spiritual (true living) water.  She begins
to believe, and she rushes to tell others about the One with Whom she has begun
a faith-filled relationship, after all of her unfaithful relationships of old. 
She becomes a proclaimer of this faith-full relationship.  As a result, others
come to Jesus and ask that He  remain and share His gifts with them. Traditionally
this Gospel has been part of the Lenten readings as a preparation for the
celebration of the faith in the Risen Lord.  This Gospel is read to prepare
those who will receive the Easter Sacraments of Initiation and will become part
of the faith community.  Through Baptism, the new believers will be welcomed
into the community of believers.  They will proclaim their faith and begin to
live as full members of the believing community.  This reading speaks to those
about to be received fully into the Church through reception of one or more of
the Sacraments of Initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Eucharist).  It
proclaims a message about the role of the life-giving waters of Baptism and
gift of faith.  It also should speak to all of us who already are baptized
believers.  It is a challenge for us to realize the blessed gift that faith is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, through Jesus and other believers, has offered us the
gift of faith.  GOD is the initiator of faith.  Just as the promise of living
water was made to the woman at the well, faith is a divine gift that is made
accessible to us.  We can choose to accept the gift or reject it.  It is our
free will that allows us to do what we want with the gift of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can ask questions and explore what the gift is all about,
just as the woman at the well.  It is in the dialogue and thedeepening
relationship with Jesus that we will come to realize the greatness of the One
Who makes us the offer.  The gift may expose us and make us face the realities
of our lives, just as Jesus did with the Samaritan woman.  We may try at first
to hide our lives from GOD, but GOD knows our lives better than we know them
ourselves.  And GOD will continue to develop the relationship, if we are open
to the gift of faith.  We may look at our old routines, including our religious
practices, in a new light.  The Lord Jesus will be asking us to worship GOD in
Spirit and Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After we have experienced the newness of the gift of living
water (faith), we will want to share this gift with others.  We will tell them
of our experiences of the Messiah-Christ, the One Who has told us everything
about ourselves.  We will ask others to come and drink of the life-giving
waters of faith.  True faith cannot be kept to ourselves.  We will want others
to experience what we have experienced.  And when they come to the One Who
gives living water, and the Lord Jesus offers them the gift of this faith, we
will rejoice with them because they have accepted the gift of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I
experienced the Lord Jesus’ gift of life- giving faith? Have I sought to
dialogue with the Lord Jesus in order to grow in my awareness of the gift of
faith that GOD gives me?  How have I been willing to share my faith with those
around me, so that they can be brought into the life-giving relationship with
the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, in union with Holy Spirit?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever giving and ever loving. 
Through Your Son, You offer to us a never ending, always flowing, well of life-giving
sustenance.  You want us to drink fully and deeply of this source of life.  You
ask us to accept what You offer and grow in our relationship with You, Your
Son, and Your Spirit.  We thank You and praise You for Your graciousness to
us.  We thank You for those people in our lives whom You have placed in a
position where they could share their faith with us.  We ask that You send to
us Your Holy Spirit of wisdom, patience, and strength, so that we may respond
fully to the gracious gift of faith that You offer us.  May we desire to be
refreshed continually with a deepening relationship with You.  We ask that You
allow us to be used in the spread of the faith, so that Your gift will reach
even more people, and more people will come to have their thirst for You
quenched in a community of fellow believers.  As always, we make this prayer of
You, through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Kings 5: 1-15ab;         Psalm 42: 2, 3, 43: 3,
4;         Luke 4: 24-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings are tied together by the story of Naaman the
Aramean/Syrian leper.  The First Reading is the account of the healing of
Naaman.  In the Gospel, Jesus visits His “hometown” of Nazareth and mentions
Naaman as an example of how foreigners are more open to the healing power of GOD
than the local people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account from 2 Kings is of Naaman the Arameam/Syrian who
had leprosy.  We hear how he was led to seek help from the prophet Elisha. 
Because Naaman followed the directions of the prophet, he was cured of his
leprosy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our psalm response includes the phrase:  “My soul is
thirsting for the living GOD.”  This refrain should be our theme for today –
for Lent – for our life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel passage, Jesus is teaching in Nazareth, but He
is not able to proclaim the GOoD News through word or deed because the people
are not open to hearing the divine message as Jesus communicates it.  They
think that they know Who Jesus is.  They close their minds to His real
identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What do these readings have in common? Sure, there is the
obvious link in the Gospel where Jesus says, “Recall, too, the many lepers in
Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one was cured except Naaman
the Syrian.”  As I contemplated the readings, I saw an even closer link and a
message for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the story of Naaman, we hear how GOD works in both
mysterious and ordinary ways.  It is not just a lucky happenstance (or a
coincidence) that the servant of Naaman’s wife is a girl from Israel.  It is,
as a youth group says, a “GODincidence.”  The young girl is there by GOD’s plan
to allow Naaman to hear about the prophet of the GOD of Israel.  Naaman takes a
chance on the opportunity offered to him to go to Israel to be healed.  As he
arrives, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>king of Israel lacks the trust that GOD could heal the
leper.  He believes that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naaman was there to cause problems for the kingdom of
Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elisha hears about what has happened and he offers GOD’s
service to Naaman.  Elisha asks Naaman to simply plunge himself seven times
into the Jordan River to be healed.  Naaman at first baulks at this answer to
his problem.  He thinks that the rivers of Damascus are more powerful and
better than the Jordan River.  Only after being swayed by his servants does he
take</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the chance of following the directions of the prophet.  And
thus, he is healed of his leprosy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To me this story is the story of trusting in GOD’s presence
Who is active in our lives.  GOD is always there working through the
circumstances of our life.  If we open our eyes – the eyes of faith – we will
see GOD’s hand at work in the events of our daily living.  In the First
Reading, GOD is manifesting the divine presence through the Israelite servant
girl.  She has faith in a GOD Who can heal, and she has faith in GOD’s prophet
who would be instrumental in the healing.  Naaman has to trust in GOD’s
revelation through the Israelite servant girl.  He takes the leap of faith and
goes to his king and asks permission to go to Israel to be healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The king of Israel lacks faith in GOD.  The king is
mistrusting of GOD and of Naaman.  He thinks the worst of the situation and
cannot believe that GOD is sending Naaman to be healed.  His lack of faith
almost prevents the miracle from happening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Elisha, the faith-filled prophet of GOD, senses that this
event is happening to allow GOD’s presence to be manifested not only to Naaman
but also to the king and people of Israel.  Elisha does not perform some
outlandish ceremony or enchant some mysterious words.  He simply asks Naaman to
plunge himself in the River Jordan.  (I take this as alluding to the “plunge”–
βαπτίσειν – baptisein of “Baptism” – the beginning of faith.) For a while,
Naaman lacks faith.  He does not believe that GOD can be working through the
act of washing in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the River Jordan.  He could have gone to the more powerful
rivers of his home country.  Naaman’s servants have </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faith. They convince Naaman to trust that GOD can be working
in and through Elisha’s direction. Once again, Naaman takes the leap of faith
and follows the directives of the man of GOD, and he is healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus in the Gospel refers to the act of faith by Naaman,
the foreigner, and his being healed because he believed in GOD’s healing
presence. Jesus remarks that the many lepers of Israel were not healed because
they were not willing to take the leap of faith and experience GOD’s presence
in their lives. Jesus reminds the people of His hometown of Nazareth that they
are taking Him for granted. They think they know Him because Jesus has grown up
in their midst. They cannot believe that GOD is working in Jesus – much less
that He could be GOD’s Son. Their lack of faith prevents them from experiencing
the wonders of GOD as proclaimed by Jesus in His words and deeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge I receive from the readings is to see where my
faith is. Oh, it’s easy to say, “I believe in GOD.” Yet do I really have my
eyes open to see GOD working in my daily life? Do I think that things happen by
“luck” or do I believe that GOD can manifest the divine presence to me in the
circumstances of my daily living? I need to open my eyes of faith to see the wonders
of GOD’s touch in the simple things of my ordinary routine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago, I had to be in Rancho Cucamonga for a
workshop I was presenting. I had been helping at my local church and had been
delayed leaving church to go to the workshop. I dreaded the path I was planning
to take because earlier in the day the traffic had been backed up at the
intersection of the 57 and the I-10 freeways. They had been doing work and
there was a big convention at the Fairgrounds. Yet, I was able to get through
the traffic in almost record time. I heard later that there was more congestion
at that point. I don’t think I was just “lucky” or it was a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>coincidence. I believe that GOD was with me. It was another
example of a GODincidence. I was able to praise GOD for seeing me through and
allowing me to arrive safely and with enough time to get things ready for the
workshop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I am open to seeing GOD’s presence in ordinary
happenings, everything can be an opportunity for deepening my relationship with
GOD. GOD is willing to reveal the divine presence in the normal routine of my
life. And sometimes even greater things can happen if I but trust that GOD is
at work. When I start to doubt GOD’s presence, things do not turn out as well.
I need to keep searching for GOD’s presence. I need, as the psalmist reminds us
today, to say, “My soul is thirsting for the living GOD: when shall I see GOD
face to face?” If I just open my eyes of faith, I will see GOD each and every
moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My faith will allow GOD to work more fully in my life and
the lives of the people around me. My openness to GOD, not taking GOD for
granted, will allow the GOoD News of GOD’s presence to be revealed in word and
deed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How do I see GOD in
the ordinary events of my daily life? What prevents me from being more aware of
GOD’s hand at work in my life? How can I be to others a witness of GOD’s
presence in their lives?   Who could most benefit from my reassurance of GOD’s
desire to touch their lives today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever present in the ordinary
events of everyday situations.  Through Your GOoDness, You want to reveal
Yourself to us.  We often take You for granted, forgetting about Your presence
in our lives.  We attribute things to “luck” instead of believing that You are
active in the daily events of life.  You ask us to search for You and thirst
for You, our living GOD. You are the living GOD Who manifests Your love
constantly, if we but open our eyes of faith.  Your Son came to reveal the GOoD
News of Your ever-present love for us.  He promises to work mightily in our
lives if we but trust Him and You.  Continue to fill us with the gifts/fruits
of Your Holy Spirit: the gifts of wisdom, understanding, faith, hope, and
love.  And may the gifts we receive allow us to see Your presence in the little
happenings of daily existence.  And may we give You all the glory and praise as
You continue to make Yourself known to us, especially in the words and actions
of Your Son, Jesus the Christ, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Solemnity of the Annunciation of the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(replacing Tue. of 3rd Week of Lent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Annunciation of the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 7: 10-14, 8: 10;      Psalm 40: 7-8a,
8b-9, 10, 11;      Hebrews 10: 4-10;       Luke 1: 26-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Annunciation of the Lord.  This
solemnity is observed normally on March 25, nine months before Christmas. 
Today’s readings point to the importance of the solemnity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the reading from Isaiah, we hear that a young woman (also
translated as “a virgin”) will conceive a son.  The child will be called
Immanuel, “GOD with us.”  Today we celebrate the conception of the Lord Jesus
in the womb of the virgin Mary.  Jesus is truly “GOD with us” in a way that no
one could ever have imagined before His time, and many people do not fully
comprehend or appreciate even to this day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes the words of the readings from Hebrew (our
Second Reading today).  What GOD wants is not a lot of rituals and sacrifices. 
GOD wants people to accept the gifts GOD has for them and respond by seeking to
do the will of GOD.  Mary was willing to do so.  She said “yes” to GOD’s will,
even though she did not know what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it would entail.  Jesus also said “yes” to the will of His
Abba-Father.  And thus, Jesus, the Son of GOD, was conceived as a human in the
womb of Mary, by the overpowering of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reading from the Letter to Hebrews expands the psalm and
applies it to Jesus.  Jesus came not to perform sacrifices and rituals.  Jesus
came to do the will of His Abba – to announce the GOoD News of GOD’s love and
GOD’s desire to have a more personal relationship with each and every person. 
This was only done by the Son</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of GOD’s offering of His human body in perfect obedience to
the will of His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today is the account of the angel (“messenger”)
Gabriel appearing to Mary and asking her if she would consent to be the mother
of the Messiah, the mother of the Savior, the mother of “GOD with us.”  Mary
does not understand how that could be possible since she has “not known man,”
i.e., had no physical relations with a man.  She is not doubting GOD’s request,
she is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wondering how it would be possible.  After being informed it
will be by the power of the Holy Spirit, she says her fiat, “Let it be.”  This is
her complete submission to the will of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important we celebrate the conception and incarnation
of Jesus as a human in the womb of Mary, but more important than Jesus’ human
beginning (His incarnation) is His suffering, death, and resurrection.  Yes, it
is true without the conception and incarnation there could be no suffering,
death, and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, Jesus’ becoming human was only the beginning of what
His full earthly mission and ministry was to be.  His obedience in becoming
human was to lead to His obedience in giving His life for others.  So often
Christians put greater emphasis on Jesus’ birth and celebration of Christmas,
than they do on the importance of Jesus’ death and resurrection.  The Church
reminds us that the reason Jesus became human was to give His life for our
salvation by His dying on the cross and also to restore life to us through His
resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another thought that struck me is the submission to the will
of GOD.  Mary was willing to do the will of  GOD.  She did not always know what
that fully meant.  Today’s solemnity is an example.  A young maiden is
approached by a messenger (angel) of GOD.  That would be startling in and of
itself.  Gabriel declares Mary’s graced position in the eyes of GOD.  The angel
announces GOD’s plan to have the Messiah, the Christ, the chosen Anointed One
of GOD, be born of Mary.  Mary wonders how this could be possible.  She is a
virgin. Gabriel says it will be by the overshadowing of the Ruah YHWH, the
Spirit of GOD, that the Son of GOD will take flesh in her womb.  She only needs
to accept the gift and say “Yes” to GOD’s plan – GOD’s will.  Not knowing all
the implications of what this means and how GOD will work it out, and also
realizing that there will be a lot of further unknowns in the days and weeks
and years ahead, Mary obediently says her fiat – “Let it be done to me
according to GOD’s will” or simply, “Your will be done.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obedience to GOD is not always tied into full understanding
of what lies ahead.  It is trusting that GOD will provide the
strength-fortitude and knowledge and wisdom on an “as needed” basis, as the
plan unfolds. Obedience is hearing what GOD says and being willing to trust
that GOD will see us through it all (providence). Obedience is part of the
response of a disciple – a disciplined learner of the Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This submission to the will of GOD is also manifested in
Jesus.  As the Son of GOD, co-eternal with the Abba, He was perfect.  Yet, in
response to His Abba’s plan, the Son of GOD was willing to humble Himself and
become human.  In His human nature, He would be limited, and He would face
challenging times.  Yet the Son was willing to do what His Abba asked.  The Son
of GOD was willing to allow Himself to be limited by His human nature.  Jesus
was willing to say His fiat – “Let it be, not as I wish but as You will.” 
Jesus repeatedly said this from before the Annunciation to Mary, throughout His
life, and especially during His passion and death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the fiat of both Jesus and Mary – their
willingness to hear GOD’s plan and accept it, no matter where it would lead. 
And today we are reminded that this was only the beginning of their doing the
will of GOD.  The climax of their fiat would come at the cross and the empty
tomb and the ascension to the Abba in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we are invited to hear GOD’s announcement (annunciation)
to us.  We are asked to accept what GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has planned for us.  We may not know fully where it leads
and what lies ahead.  The message is being given, we can respond by saying
“fiat” – “Let it be” or we can refuse the invitation.  The choice is ours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How has the Lord
Jesus’ invitation to do the will of GOD been made known to me? Who or what
experience(s) has/have been GOD’s angel (“messenger”) to me?  Have I always
been open to GOD’s “messenger” coming to me and asking me to do GOD’s will? 
How willingly have I responded with my “fiat” to GOD’s will, even though I did
not know all of what was being asked of me? How open to the over-shadowing of
the Holy Spirit have I been? Do I pray regularly to be open to the Holy Spirit’s
presence and power in my life? How can I help reassure others of GOD’s call in
their lives and GOD’s being with them if they but say, “fiat”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, always offering us a choice. 
Through Your GOoDness, You invite us to an ever deepening relationship with
You.  You give us the freedom to say “Fiat” or to say “No.”  We ask that You
continue to overshadow us with Your Holy Spirit and give us the courage to
respond with affirmation to Your requests.  We may not always see the big picture,
but we ask You to fill us with the trust that You will empower us to do
whatever You ask of us, just as You did for Mary and Your Son, Jesus.  We thank
You for Your patience when we have not fully committed ourselves to doing Your
will and we seek Your forgiveness.  We give You glory, honor, and praise in and
through our Brother Jesus, Your Son, Who said His “Yes” to You before the
moment of the Annunciation to His death on the cross and Who is Our Risen Lord,
and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of Third Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Catherine of Genoa</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Deuteronomy 4: 1, 5-9;         Psalm 147: 12-13,
15-16, 19-20          Matthew 5: 17-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The commands of the LORD are meant to be yet another sign of
GOD’s love for the people whom GOD has chosen. The GOD’s Word spoken through
Moses in today’s First Reading reminds us of that, as does the Gospel.  GOD has
given the law as a reminder of the relationship that GOD has established with
the Chosen People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up this theme and speaks to us of the fact
that GOD has not proclaimed the divine message to any other people except the
Chosen People of GOD at that time in history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, tells us that He has not come to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>change the law and the teaching of the prophets but to bring
them to fulfillment.  The close relationship that GOD has demonstrated through
the giving of the commandments is fulfilled in the teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The precepts of the LORD are not meant to restrict us and
our freedom, but to draw us closer to GOD.  Parents set certain parameters with
their children, especially when the kids are young, not to prevent them from
having fun, but to protect them from harm.  Such things as “not playing in the
street” is meant to keep them safe.  The early “rules” that parents set down
for their children are primarily a list of “Don’ts.”  This is because
youngsters have to learn the meaning of “No!” although they, like all children,
sometimes chose to break the rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has done the same thing with the people whom the LORD
has chosen, not only in the Ten Commandments, but in other ways.  Today’s First
Reading puts it this way:  “For what great nation is there that has a god so
close to it as the LORD, our GOD, is to us?”   The passage goes on to remind us
to “not forget the things that your own eyes have seen, nor let them slip from
your memory as long as you live, but to teach them to your children and to your
children’s children.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has come to continue the close relationship of GOD
with the people whom GOD has chosen (that includes all people).  Thus, Jesus
fulfills the purpose of the laws of old.  Jesus reassures all of us that we are
GOD’s chosen people – people whom GOD loves.  Jesus raises the commands and
precepts to a new level.  He wants us to realize the love GOD has for us and to
share that love with others.  He says to us:  “Whoever fulfills and teaches
these commands shall be great in the Reign of GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In His teachings and His lifestyle Jesus manifests the
purpose of the commands of GOD and simplifies them to love of GOD and love of
neighbor.  St. Paul speaks about the great command of love that frees us from
the laws of old.  The more we realize the relationship GOD desires to have with
us and how much GOD loves us, the more we are free to live a life that reflects
that loving relationship with GOD and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, I return to the parallel with children – with
adult children.  Parents no longer set rules and regulations and list of don’ts
and dos for their adult children.  What is exciting is to see how some adult
children now choose to do what is GOoD for themselves and others, even going
beyond what others expect of them.  They seek to be thoughtful of others and
build healthy relationships with friends and co-workers not because they are
commanded to do so, but because they desire to do what is right and even going
beyond what is required.  In our spiritual life, as we mature in our faith, we
do not need the strict parameters of rules and regulations, especially the
“don’ts,” because we will be motivated by the purpose behind all the rules and
regulations.  Our concern will not be:  “What must I do to keep the
commandments?” or “What do I have to do to slip into heaven?” but rather, “How
can I more powerfully manifest the love GOD has for me and others?”  Instead of
trying to do the minimum to get by, we will strive to do the most to live out
the relationship we have with GOD. The more we develop our relationship with
GOD, the more we will want to proclaim that relationship by living a life that
reflects GOD’s closeness to us and to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So as I reflect on the Word of GOD today, I paraphrase the
words in the First Reading:  “The LORD, our GOD, loves us so much and is so
close to us, that I want to take that divine love and share it with others.”  I
will strive to do the right thing, not because I am required to do so, but
because I want to manifest the love GOD has for me.  Thus, I will try to see
others as my Abba-Father sees them and treat them with the same love and
understanding as Jesus does.  I will want to have them experience the presence
of the Holy Spirit in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, in relationship to the ten commandments, particular
those that deal with others, I move beyond the commands and prohibitions and
seek to do that which enhances my relationships with others.  Instead of
thinking what I can do so that I will not dishonor my parents, I will strive to
love them for the love GOD has manifested through them.  Instead of seeing how
I can avoid murdering and hurting others, I will seek what is the best for
others because they, too, are loved by GOD.  I will not just avoid bearing
false witness against my neighbor, I will do what I can so they will know the
truth about GOD, and I will do what I can to edify and build up my neighbor
because they are loved by GOD and by me.  I will not just abstain from stealing
and taking things from others, I will see how I can share what I have with
them, especially those who have less than I do or who are in need of my help,
for I will want the best for them since they are my sisters and brothers in
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, I will strive not so much to just avoid sinning,
instead I will seek to develop what more I can do to live out the relationship
with GOD and also with others, for I am in relationship with them through my
relationship with GOD.  And I will want to share that relationship and teach
that lifestyle to others, not so that I will be great in the kingdom of GOD,
but because I will want others to experience the ever-deepening relationship
with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I see rules
and regulations as being an aid in deepening my relationship with GOD and with 
others?   Have rules and regulations ever been at odd with my drawing closer to
GOD? How have I dealt with those tensions?  Did I end up coming to a deeper
understanding of how GOD wants me to respond to the divine love?  What can I do
to reflect to others the love that GOD has for them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, our ever-loving Parent,
Abba-Father of our Lord Jesus and, through adoption, Abba of all of us. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have shown Your close relationship with Your chosen
people by giving them guidelines and commands.  You did this, not to restrict
their freedom, but to show Your loving concern for them.  You asked that they
live by these commands as a sign of their acceptance of Your love.  Through
Your Son, Jesus, You have established an even closer relationship with Your
holy people.  You allow us to call You our Abba, Father, Daddy.  Through Your
Son’s teaching and lifestyle, You ask us to not look at how we can avoid
breaking Your law, but how we can manifest the close relationship You have with
us.  Your Son has demonstrated how we should love others and seek the best for
them, reaching out with compassion and concern, not because it is required, but
because it is the loving thing – the GODly thing – to do.  Through the power of
Your Holy Spirit, continue to open our eyes to ways we can be more like Jesus. 
Give us the strength and wisdom to look beyond mere mortal limitations and see
the great things that can be, if we truly live as Your beloved and loving
daughters and sons.  Help us to proclaim in our lives the GOoD News of Your
relationship with Your new Chosen and Holy People, that  includes all people. 
We ask this of You through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who gave His life as
a demonstration of the loving relationship with You, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.
Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of Third Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Gregory of Narek   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Jeremiah 7: 23-28;              Psalm 95: 1-2,
6-7, 8-9;             Luke 11: 14-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What’s your orientation? Which way are you headed? Those are
valid questions in light of our readings today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jeremiah is told by the LORD that even though he and the
other prophets have tried to get the people on the right track, the people have
chosen to go another way.  Instead of turning their faces to GOD (ad Deum), the
Chosen People of GOD have chosen to not be the people of GOD and have turned
their backs to GOD and are heading away from GOD (a theos).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The response in the Responsorial Psalm concerns the
unfaithfulness of the Israelites in the desert where they did not listen to
GOD’s voice, but they have tested GOD by demanding water at Meribah and Massah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus casts out an evil spirit from an individual in today’s
Gospel, and people think that Jesus must be evil to have this power over evil
spirits.  Jesus reassures them that it is by the power of GOD that He casts out
the evil spirits.  He continues by saying if He has performed this exorcism by
evil power, then evil would be working against evil – a losing proposition for
evil.  Jesus also speaks of the need for unity and being of one mind among all
those who follow Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am challenged to make
a decision.  I need to be either ad Deum or a theos.  There is no middle ground
on which to stand.  Either I am fully involved in deepening my relationship
with GOD, or I want nothing to do with GOD.  Either I am working for the spread
of the GOoD News of GOD’s presence in the world, or I am working against the
Gospel message.  The choice of which way I am going is laid before me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a follower of Jesus, a disciple (disciplined learner),
is not a part-time avocation.  It must be a full-time commitment on my part.  I
cannot be a quasi-Christian.  That was the decision that many of the canonized
saints had to face.  I recall the accounts of many of the “saints” who had to
make a choice between earthly life or eternal life.  The choice came down to
being faithful to Christ and losing their earthly, human lives, or turning
their back on GOD and having an apparently more pleasant earthly life but
losing eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may say that it is not as necessary for us to make such a
dramatic statement as martyrs and saints have done in the past.  After all we
are not faced with such a decision as to be a martyr for the faith or deny our
relationship with GOD.  Yet, in little ways, each day we are asked to be bold
in living out our commitment to GOD.  Do we make conscious choices to deepen
our relationship with GOD each day by spending time in prayer and reflection?
Do we set aside time to be with GOD or do we allow the busy-ness of our
everyday life get in the way of our relationship with the Lord Jesus and with
others? Do we seek to promote Gospel values by living a life which reflects
Christ Jesus, or do we give in to the values of the world – wealth, selfish
pleasures, and fame? Are we gathering with the truth of the Lord Jesus, or are
we scattering with the falseness of the world?  In some ways it may be more
difficult for us today to really be with Jesus.  There are so many enticements
that draw us away – things that, in and of themselves, are not bad.  Yet they
can draw us away from our full orientation toward GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to just get into a pattern of drifting along
with the current, flowing down the river of worldly life, instead of putting in
the effort to paddle against the current and to consciously head toward GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, I feel challenged to look at my life and see
where I am going.   As I continue my Lenten journey, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize I have to re-commit myself to being on task, on
target, making a conscientious decision to be with the Lord Jesus.  I have to
fight against the prevailing current that seeks to sweep me down the stream,
away from GOD.  If I am not fully working at getting to my destination (GOD),
then I am losing ground and being taken further away from GOD.  It does not
mean that I won’t be forced off course and even get flipped over by the
whirlpools and rapids I am facing.  I may even get overturned in the struggle to
head upstream towards GOD.  Yet if I am exerting myself and striving to go in
the right direction, GOD will see me through.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded of that once when, after a full day at school
(10 hours), I spent eight hours with an older person.  I picked up this person
who was being released from a skilled nursing facility, drove her to a grocery
store and assisted in the shopping with this person (and that took about 1½
hours to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pick up just a few items).  I then went to this person’s
favorite restaurant so that her first non-institutionalized meal in 5½ weeks
could be eaten.  Following the time-lengthy meal, I drove the person home,
unpacked the groceries, laid out the medicines that were to be taken before bed
and in the morning for the next couple of weeks.  While spending those eight
hours with the convalescing individual, I was thinking about all the schoolwork
and other work I could (and should) have been doing.  I also realized that what
GOD wanted me to do at that time was to minister to this individual, and to do
it with a loving, caring way, so that this person realized that my total focus
was on this individual and nothing else mattered.  This individual sensed
that.  The person realized that for those eight hours, I was there, willing to
do whatever needed to be done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is saying to me today:  “Are you with Me? Are you
willing to dig your paddle in and move in My direction?”  I pray that I will be
aware of the strength that the Lord Jesus provides, and I will be able to
answer: “I’m with You.  Let’s go!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my basic
orientation?  If I say I am heading towards GOD, how committed am I to doing
that with my full attention, strength, and will power? Am I 100% in my wanting
to be on the track to GOD?  What is keeping me from giving totally of myself? 
How can I live out my commitment to the Lord Jesus in my everyday life,
especially as I interact with other individuals?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You LORD GOD, ever loving and ever challenging. 
Through Your GOoDness, You once again remind us that being one of Your chosen
people means making a decision to be heading toward You.  Through Your Son, You
continually invite us to come to You.  We sometimes find it smooth paddling and
easy traveling in Your direction.  And yet at other times it is a real struggle
to keep our focus on You and head toward You.  As we hear Your Son speak to us,
“Come, follow Me,” give us the strength and courage to answer His invitation
and dedicate ourselves to being with Him as He leads us to You.  Through the
power of Your Holy Spirit, give us the courage to take the risks involved in
following Jesus.  Help us to be conscious that Jesus is with us, or in a more
real sense, we are with Him.  Thank You again for sending Jesus to show us the
Way.  As always, we pray this in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, Your Son,
and our Brother, Who leads us, guides us, and does the majority of the work for
us, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of the Third Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Catharine of Bologna:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Hosea 14: 2-10;          Psalm 81: 6c-8a, 8bc-9,
10-11ab, 14 and 17;          Mark 12: 28-34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, the prophet Hosea speaks about turning
away from our sins and returning to the LORD.  Once we do that, GOD will give
us new life, abundant life.  We shall be strong, bear rich fruit, produce a
fragrant smell, if we but turn to the LORD.  GOD continues to say to us, “I
will love them freely.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm gives us GOD’s reassuring Word that if we make GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our number one choice, GOD will provide the best food for
us.  We are told that not only will water flow from the rock, but also honey. 
GOD will not only take care of our needs, but also give us sweetness besides,
if we listen to our GOD and walk in GOD’s ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Jesus speaks of the greatest
commandments: “Love the LORD our GOD with all your heart, with all your soul,
with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all your mind, and with all your strength. . .Love your
neighbor as yourself.”  This is worth more than sacrifices and rituals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these passages, my mind keeps thinking about
two words:  love and relationship.  I realized that they are the essence of Who
GOD is and who we are called to be.  We are told that GOD is love (1 John 4:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8 and 1 John 4: 16).  Since GOD is love, love is the essence
of Who GOD is as Trinity.  What unites the Abba- Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit is love.  It is the relationship between the three persons in the
Trinity.  Love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thus is synonymous with relationship.  This relationship
between Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit is so powerful in essence that GOD wants to
share this love, this relationship with humans.  GOD does not need to extend
this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship – this love – to humanity, but GOD freely
chooses to love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Creation is part of GOD’s choosing to love and choosing to
establish a relationship with us.  And all GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ever asks is that we accept the divine gift of love and the
relationship that GOD offers.  GOD does not force us to accept this gift, for
another of GOD’s gifts to us is the gift of free will.  Love is essentially the
choice to accept the invitation of being in relationship.  GOD will not make us
love; GOD will not make us be in relationship.  A forced love or relationship
is not true love, and it cannot produce an enduring relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love is not just a nice feeling we have when things are
going right.  Love is that decision to be there for the sake of the other.  GOD
has proven this love to us by the sending of Jesus, the Son of GOD.  It was not
always a “nice” feeling Jesus had as He proclaimed the GOoD News of GOD’s
loving relationship.  He was met with opposition.  He ultimately had to lay
down His life in order to show how much GOD wants to be in relationship with
us.  And today Jesus reminds us that all GOD asks of us is that we freely
choose to give all we have to the process of deepening this relationship with
GOD.  We are asked to love – be in relationship with GOD – with our whole heart
(emotions and decision), our whole soul (spirituality), our whole mind
(intellect), and our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whole strength (physical being).  The Lord Jesus desires
that we are totally and completely in relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if we freely choose to give ourselves totally to this
relationship with GOD, we will also freely choose to be in relationship with
all those with whom GOD also desires a relationship – that is every other
living being.  For in our developing a loving relationship with others, we will
be deepening our relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It will not always be easy.  It will demand our full
attention, our conscious effort, to devote ourselves to a relationship with GOD
and others.  It means that we will have to make a decision “to be” for the
other rather than just allow things to happen or seek our own pleasures. Love
means that we will place the relationship with others ahead of our own
desires.  True love is the unconditional giving to another, working for the
best for the other, doing whatever we can so that the other will  know we want to
be in relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded of that some time ago.  After the busy days
(9+ hours of work at school and 8+ hours helping a friend) I had on a few days
of a certain week, I thought that I could leave school after 10 hours, go home,
cook dinner, and work on correcting about 45 term papers, plus other work (it
was the end of the marking period).  I was starting dinner when the phone
rang.  It was the friend with whom I had spent 8 hours on each of the two
previous days.  The friend, who lives 15 miles away, needed help with
medications.  Having suffered a stroke, it was hard for this person to see
clearly.  Although a home nurse had dropped by during the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>day, the medications were not set out.  I finished cooking
dinner, put the food out for everyone in the house, and drove down to the
friend’s home to help straighten out the medications.  After spending two hours
sorting the dozen or so prescription drugs, labeling containers with the
morning and evening pills, I drove home.  My attitude while I was with the
friend was that this person was the most important person at that moment in my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life and I was willing to do whatever was necessary, even
though I would have rather been home, even if it was only to read and correct
terms papers.  I realized I was loving GOD by caring for this friend who needed
my help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, we are reminded today, “To love GOD. . .and to love
our neighbor. . .is more than any burnt offering</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or sacrifice.”  Our faith is not just religious ceremonies
and rites; our faith is a relationship, a loving relationship.  It is the gift
that GOD is freely offering to us.  We are asked to give a gift back:  our
response of freely choosing to develop that relationship through all the joys
and sorrows we experience in life.  It is saying that our number one priority
is to be in a loving relationship with GOD and with those who are also called
into the loving relationship with GOD (that includes everyone).  GOD desires to
have a loving relationship with everyone, so we should also want to have a loving
relationship with them.  The does not mean I have to agree with everyone or
necessarily like what they say or do, but I respect them as individuals loved
by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, today I am making the commitment to spend time in
further developing my relationship with my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, with our GOD.  I plan to take the time to experience
how much this relationship means to GOD, how blessed I am that GOD wants this
relationship with me.  As I reflect on this loving relationship, I am humbled
by GOD’s graciousness.  I also realize how much I have missed out on what this
relationship could be by my choosing other things rather than spending time in
relationship.  I also plan to commit myself to reaching out to others in a way
that shows them that I want to be in a loving relationship, a GODly
relationship, with them.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>already feel energized by GOD’s relationship with me, and I
want to bring that enthusiasm (en theos – in GOD)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into my relationship with others.  I will be more conscious
of how my actions should reflect my desire to be there for the other as a sign
of my loving relationship with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What does love mean
to me? Am I able to love someone with all my being, thinking more of her/him
than myself?  Do I see that GOD’s love for me enables me to give of myself to
another person? What can I do to deepen my relationship with GOD? How will that
flow into my relationships with other people today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and always desirous
of being in loving relationship, for You are love. Your relationship within
Yourself (Abba-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) is so powerful and life-giving
that You have chosen to create us in Your loving image.  You have put in our
being the desire to be in relationship. Through Your Son, Jesus, You have
revealed what having a true, loving relationship is all about.  His example of
giving to others (no matter what the personal cost) spurs us on.  His spending
time in quiet prayer with You, His loving Abba, reminds us of the importance of
our personal time with You.  His constant focusing on doing Your will as a sign
of being in relationship with You enables us to seek to do Your will also. 
Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, inflame within our hearts the fire of
Your love and Your relationship, so that we may love You with our whole heart,
whole soul, whole mind, and whole strength.  May the gifts we receive from Your
Holy Spirit strengthen us, so we can love and be in relationship with others,
in the selfless and giving way that Your Son demonstrated during His earthly
life.  We give You praise and thanks for sharing Your loving relationship with
us, especially through Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and our Savior, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of Third Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Ludovico of Casoria:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Hosea 6: 1-6;         Psalm 51: 3-4, 18-19, 20-21ab;        
Luke 18: 9-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humility is central to our readings today. The First Reading
describes people’s reaction when they are faced with difficulties. They can,
all of the sudden, be “religious” and call on GOD for help. They don’t want a
relationship with GOD, they want action from GOD. The psalm gives a dialog
between GOD and the psalmist. The LORD GOD proclaims that what is desired is a
relationship between GOD and the people. The psalmist answers back, humbly
praying that he desires such a relationship also. In the Gospel, Jesus relates
the parable of the Pharisee and the tax collector who both come to the temple
to voice their words. One is boastful and the other is humble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Hosea gives a portrait of the Chosen People in
rough times. It is only then that they turn to the LORD and seek GOD’s help.
When things are not going well, they start practicing the external signs of
their religion. GOD speaks to them and says: “It is love (decision to do what
is right in GOD’s eyes) that I desire, not sacrifice; and knowledge of GOD
(that is, a relationship with GOD) rather than holocausts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial picks up on this same theme with the
refrain (from the First Reading) of the words of GOD: “It is mercy I desire,
and not sacrifice.” The psalmist responds to GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word by saying: “My sacrifice is a contrite spirit; a heart
contrite and humbled, O GOD, you will not spurn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus relates the parable of the Pharisee and
the tax collector praying in the temple. The Pharisees speaks more about
himself than to, or about, GOD. The tax collector seeks GOD and GOD’s loving
mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The word that comes to mind after reflecting on these
readings is “humble.” I keep hearing the song, Humble Thyself in the Sight of
the Lord. As we humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord Jesus, He can lift us
up to a closer relationship with GOD, His Abba-Father, Who is also our
Abba-Father. What the Lord Jesus wants from us is that we be truly humble.
Being humble is not a false cry for pity. It is not self-degradation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humility is an honest look at who I, as an individual, am in
the sight of GOD, that is, who am I as seen from GOD’s perspective. It is
sincere desire to be in a better relationship with GOD, and an admission that I
can only do that with the grace of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being humble is realizing my GOD-given talents and
abilities, and also my shortcomings. If I am truly humble, I will realize all
the blessings in my life – how GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>directly and indirectly touched my life to bring out the
best </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in me. As I think about how my life has been enriched by GOD
and by others, I can see the graciousness of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I can also see how I have not always been responsive to
what GOD has given me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading is a criticism of those who only turn to
GOD when they need GOD’s help. They are willing to put on a show of being
“humble” in order to get something from GOD. They start performing religious
activities to win GOD’s approval, but their humility is false. They do not want
to be in relationship with GOD, they only want something from GOD. Yet we, like
the people addressed in the First Reading, often turn to GOD to solve our
problems. We want action from GOD rather than wanting to be in relationship
with GOD. We want GOD to do </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things for us, but we don’t want to make a commitment to a
long-term relationship with GOD. We must not judge others and their attitudes.
We are called only to look at our own correspondence (prayer life) with GOD and
see if we are seeking things from GOD or seeking a relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm reminds us of what we need is a
contrite spirit and a humble heart. The Lord Jesus wants us to humbly come
before GOD and seek a closer relationship with GOD, a long-term commitment to
be one with GOD. This includes admitting that we have not been as faithful in
deepening our relationship as we could have been. It is when we are in
relationship with GOD that GOD will provide what we truly need (not necessarily
want) – and much more besides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we are in a proper relationship with GOD, we will also
know how we can be in proper relationships with others. In the Gospel parable,
the Pharisee is centered on himself. In his “prayer” he uses the word “I” five
times and mentions GOD only twice. He focuses on what he does, not who he is in
GOD’s sight. He is not praying; he is boasting about himself using prayer as a
guise. He acts as if he is doing GOD a favor by his actions. He seems to imply
to GOD that GOD needs him, not that he needs GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The tax collector, on the other hand, focuses on GOD and his
relationship with GOD. He wants to be in a relationship with GOD. He admits his
need for mercy, as he admits his failing in faithfulness. He wants the link
between himself and GOD to be restored. He wants to be bound again (re-ligio)
to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These readings also remind me of the all-day workshop I
attended. Rev. Richard Rohr, OFM was speaking about “The Spirituality of the
Two Halves of Life.” The people in the First Half of Life (not chronologically
based) are like the Pharisee. They are “ego-centered.” They obey rules and
regulations so they can prove to others that they are doing what is right, and
therefore, they should be admired. The tax collector is a person in the Second
Half of Life. He does not focus on himself but on GOD. He does not care what
other people think of him as long as he can have a relationship with GOD. He
admits the mistakes (sins) he has committed and asks to be treated mercifully.
Humility thus is an attribute of those who are in the Second Half of Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am challenged today to humbly look at my relationship with
GOD. I can truly praise and thank GOD for what GOD has done and is doing in my
life. I can see how GOD has touched my life and gifted me in so many ways. I
can also see how GOD has allowed others to bring the divine message to me. I
can focus on signs of GOD’s relationship with me. And I also realize that I
have not always been faithful in my relationship with GOD. I can humbly
acknowledge Who GOD is and who I am in the sight of GOD and this humble
acknowledgment will edify and build me up and will also have an edifying or
up-building effect on others as I give GOD the glory and praise that GOD is
due.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Where am I in my
relationship with GOD? Am I performing acts and saying words to show my
importance? Or am I humbly asking for a deeper relationship with GOD, even
while I admit my sinfulness and my unworthiness?  How can I humbly manifest
GOD’s desire to lift up those who are in need of GOD’s help? What can I do
today to humbly serve others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving. Through Your
GOoDness, You call us to come humbly into Your presence. You ask us to
acknowledge Who You are and how You have touched our lives. We praise and thank
You for Your graciousness to us. You have sought to establish an ever-deepening
relationship with us. You continually offer us a share in Your life. We have
often sought to prove our importance in our accomplishments and in what we do,
rather than in who we are in Your sight and by acknowledging Your action in our
lives. Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, help us to focus on our
relationship with You, Your Son, and the Holy Spirit. Your Son, Jesus, invites
us to follow His lead. He has proclaimed the GOoD News of Your love. He invites
us to share this message with others by being in relationship with them as He
is in relationship with us. We ask that we may humble ourselves in Your sight
and make known Your presence in and to others. This we pray in the name of the
Lord Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.   <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Fourth Sunday in Lent - “A” Cycle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Peter Regalado: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: 1 Samuel 16: 1b, 6-7, 10-13a;     Psalm 23: 1-3a,
3b-4, 5, 6; Ephesians 5: 8-14;                     John 9: 1-41</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How’s your sight?  Our readings speak about seeing not just
with human vision, but also with spiritual vision – the eyes of GOD. The First
Reading describes what GOD sees in the person of David.  The Responsorial Psalm
is the familiar Psalm 23, “The Lord is my Shepherd.” In his letter to the Ephesians,
Saint Paul describes the darkness that unbelievers once experienced and how
that has changed to light that gives sight because of their acceptance of
faith.  In the Gospel, Jesus gives not only physical sight to a blind man, but
also new spiritual vision to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s First Reading, Samuel and Jesse do not see very
clearly, at least not at first.  They are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>looking with merely human eyes and not the way that GOD
sees.  GOD sees beyond the superficial, into the depths of a person.  Of all
Jesse’s sons, David is seen as the least likely candidate to be the king for
Israel.  He is the youngest of eight brothers and so, is “unimportant” – so
much so that he is sent to take of the sheep while the rest of his family
gathers at the celebration with the prophet Samuel.  Yet GOD sees something
that mere mortals could not see.  GOD calls David from shepherding sheep to
shepherding GOD’s Chosen People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist, either David or someone who thinks like David,
speaks of GOD as a shepherd. GOD cares for the divine flock and protects each
member of that flock as they walk through the valley of darkness.  GOD provides
food – rich, choice food – for those who turn to the LORD, their Shepherd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul reminds his readers
(including us) that they (and we) were once in darkness, but they (and we) are
now called to leave the dark ways behind and receive the light that Christ
gives them (and us).  The paths of darkness include vain deeds, shameful
activities, and things that should not even be mentioned (so Paul does not
mention them, but I’m sure we can think of many activities that would fit into
the category). Paul urges</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>believers to walk in the light and to see clearly what sort
of lives they must live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel passage today is one we have heard many times. 
It is filled with powerful imageries.  A man born blind becomes the center of
attention (other than Jesus, Who is always, or at least should be, the Center
of our attention). First, the blind man is the cause of the apostles’ questioning
Jesus about the reason for his blindness. The apostles want to blame it on the
personal sin of the blind man or the sin of his parents.  Jesus reassures His
disciples that blindness is not a punishment from GOD for personal wrongdoings;
blindness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(and any other physical handicap) is part of the human
condition that people experience in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus begins the healing process and the giving of sight by
making a mud and saliva paste and applying it to the blind man’s eyes.  The
process takes a while before the man sees completely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is sent to the Pool of Siloam (that means “the sent one”)
to wash away his blindness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After his healing, people cannot believe that the former
blind man is the same person.  And in some ways, they are right, he is not the
same blind person, he is now a person with sight (and insight).  His life is
changed in many ways – some very rich and exciting, some challenging and
difficult.  He will never be the person he was before, for now he “sees” and
more will be asked of him because of his new (in)sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since he had been healed on the Sabbath, the former blind
man is questioned by the religious</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leadership.  The formerly blind individual relates what
happened and the fact that he can now see. He is not sure exactly where Jesus is,
or even what Jesus looks like, after all, the last time he was with Jesus, he
was blind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The leaders call in the man’s parents and question them. 
The blind man’s parents are afraid to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>say much more than he is their son, and he was born blind. 
They don’t want to get involved and risk having to lose their place in the
community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man is brought in again and this time he boldly speaks
about his sight.  He has probably had time to reflect on what sight now means
to him.  He is seeing what happened to him in much more clear way, not just in
physical sense, but in a intellectual and spiritual sense.  He is not afraid to
even challenge those who question him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After his dismissal and being kicked out of the religious
assembly, he meets Jesus Who invites him into a closer relationship. Jesus
reveals His true identity and mission.  The man responds with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faith and with a desire to deepen the relationship with
Jesus.  The Gospel ends with Jesus challenging the religious leaders who refuse
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to admit their blindness to the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage uses the imagery of sight and blindness to speak
of the deeper reality of spiritual sight (faith) and spiritual blindness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(faithlessness or false religiosity). The personal question
for each of us is where are we in the passage?  With whom do we identify?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people may see themselves as the apostles who
misunderstand the cause of suffering and hardships. We want quick, simple
answers to what’s going on and why there are problems in the world.  We may
want to blame someone for the wrongs in the world, even blaming GOD.  After
all, its easier to blame others than to get involved and reach out with
compassion, as Jesus does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others of us may be like the blind man at the beginning of
the account.  We cannot see anything.  We sit around waiting for others to take
care of us.  We have no idea how beautiful things can be if we had sight.  We
are in the darkness of our depraved condition. We may not have chosen this
condition, yet that is where we are.  So, we try to make the best of our
situation, relying on others to provide for us, since we are in the dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next situation with which some may identify is that of
the man after Jesus has smeared the paste on the eyes.  We start to sense something
is about to happen.  We have been touched by Jesus, but we are not sure what it
all means.  We are “sent” on our way to continue experiencing the healing
process.  We have received the gift of faith, we respond to the Lord Jesus’
command, but we are still not sure how it is all going to turn out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The position of the neighbors and friends (who see the blind
man and react with disbelief) may resonate with others of us.  We cannot, or
will not, believe that GOD can act mysteriously and miraculously in other
people’s lives, especially those whom we thought were outcast and sinners.  We
question anyone who says they have been touched by GOD.  We may think they are
“touched” alright, but not by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others of us may be like the parents. We don’t want to risk
losing our position by changing our understanding of how GOD works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are comfortable in the situation in which we are.  We
don’t want to stand up for anyone, even our closest relatives or friends, if it
means that it may cost us something personally.  We shift the attention away
from us, so we don’t have to be in the spotlight and take the heat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others of us may be like the blind man near the end of the
story.  We have begun to see more clearly.  We receive another invitation from
the Lord Jesus to go further in our relationship with GOD.  It looks like the
obvious choice now that we are seeing clearly, but we need to be strengthened
in taking the next step.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then there is possibility that at times we may be like
the religious leaders.  We think we have this whole “GOD thing” down. We want
to tell GOD what GOD should be doing.  We have put GOD into our little box.  We
think we can control how GOD acts by our actions and our words.  We think we
see the whole picture clearly, but we are the most blind of all, because we
have chosen only to see GOD the way we want to see GOD.  And therefore, we
don’t see GOD at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is a great day for us to look at our spiritual
vision.  How do we see our relationship with GOD?  Do we need to have our
spiritual eyesight checked? GOD moves in mysterious ways, and as soon as we
think we see Who GOD is, GOD appears in a different manner that will escape our
sight.  Are we humble enough to admit our spiritual blindness? We should ask
GOD to remove those things that hinder our sight.  We need to continue to
petition the Lord Jesus to open our eyes of faith so that we can see with
divine vision.  It can be scary.  We will have to change our lifestyles and
live differently, but when we begin to see as GOD sees, we will be amazed at
what we had not been able to see before.  We will then ask GOD to help us see
more and we will praise GOD for the gift of (in)sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   With which
character(s) in the Gospel account do I most identify at this point in my
life?  What does my identification with the character(s) say about my spiritual
life?  In what areas of my life is there darkness and lack of vision?  What can
I do to ask GOD to enlighten me about this darkness? How can I help give new
insights to those who still seem to be in darkness without my acting with a
“better-than-thou” attitude?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever visible, yet also hidden. 
Through Your GOoDness, You continue to heal us of our blindness. You desire
that we clearly see You and Your plan for our lives.  We often want the healing
according to our plans – immediate and full, yet You remind us that it is often
a process of seeing more clearly, step by step.  Through the power of Your Holy
Spirit, give us the patience and strength to open our eyes more and more.  May
we follow the vision of Jesus, Your Son, Who has come as the Light of the
World, the One Who enlightens others.  We thank You and praise You for giving
us the insights to see our own blindness and admit our need for Your healing. 
This we ask in and through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, The Healer of the
spiritually and physically blind, the Light of the world, Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fourth Sunday in Lent - “C” Cycle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Peter Regalado:   Readings:  Joshua 5: 9a,
10-12;         Psalm 34: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2 Corinthians 5: 17-21;     Luke 15: 1-3, 11-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is Laetare Sunday.  The Latin word, laetare, means “to
rejoice.”  We are more than halfway through Lent and our readings give us
something about which we can rejoice.  In the First Reading, the Israelites
have finally (after forty years) made it into the Promised Land.  The
Responsorial challenges us to “taste and see the GOoDness of the Lord.”  In his
letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul reminds his readers that they are new, and
therefore should be improved, and that should lead</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to rejoicing.  The Gospel presents the account the Prodigal
Son for whom the excessively loving parent throws a joy-filled party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Book of Joshua relates the Israelites’ entry into the
land that had been promised them not only for the last forty years, but to
their ancestors for generations before that.  They have been wandering in the
desert for over a generation.  Very few of the original emigrants from Egypt
are still alive.  Most of the people crossing into the Promised Land have been
born in the desert and have known only manna, and occasionally quail, as food. 
They will no longer be eating the manna that GOD had provided for them during
the desert experience.  They can now rejoice as they transition from their
repentant pilgrimage into the place that GOD is giving them – a place with
rich, choice food and drink – a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes the feelings of the Israelites.  It is time
to reflect on the fact that GOD has heard their cry and taken action to give
them not only what they needed but even more.  It may have seemed like a hard
and difficult time, but that is now behind them.  They can rejoice in all that
GOD has done for them and they can bless the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul proclaims his role as ambassador of GOD’s
reconciling love.  Things are new now that believers have become part of the
new creation in and through the reconciliation made possible by Jesus.  Things
are new and different now.  There is a new and improved relationship between
GOD and the people.  This new relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>requires that the people live out the gift of faith that
they have received by turning away from their former lives of sinfulness and
proclaiming GOD’s love through their actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel presents the parable of the wayward offspring who
abuses the gifts that the loving parent has given.  After wasting all the
treasure received from the loving parent, the depraved one ends up working for
next to nothing, longing to eat the scraps that the pigs (which he is feeding)
leave behind.  It is only after coming to the realization of what used to be at
home (even for the servants), that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the demoralized one decides to return to the loving home and
hope to have some relationship with the parent who had been hurt by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>son’s acts of selfishness.  There is rejoicing exhibited by the
loving parent who has eagerly awaited the return of the errant offspring. The
rejoicing, however, is not celebrated by the elder sibling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three thoughts cross my mind as I reflect on today’s
readings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, rejoicing should be part of the life of a disciple of
the Lord Jesus.  This feeling of joy should be part of the response of one who
has accepted the gifts that come from GOD.  This sense of delight should be
both personal and communal and should lead to action.  As far as personal joy,
each person who experiences the love that GOD has for him/her should be
grateful to GOD.  GOD has not only given human life, but also a share in the
everlasting divine life because of the relationship that has been made possible
by the death and resurrection of Jesus.  As each of us reflects on what GOD is
offering us through the gift of faith, we can only rejoice in GOD’s </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>magnanimousness.  Especially as we realize how we have been
alienated from GOD through our sinfulness, we can celebrate even more GOD’s
forgiveness and willingness to reconcile us.  GOD wants each of us to hear the
words, “Welcome Home!” – even more than how the loving parent in the parable
today greeted his wayward child.  GOD is willing to restore us to an even more
exalted position and throw a larger celebration than the one we hear about in
the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secondly, our rejoicing must be communal.  We, unlike the
older sibling in the parable, must rejoice whenever one of our sisters or
brothers in the Lord Jesus (or any sinner) returns and seeks to be reconciled
to GOD.  We should not complain when GOD makes a big thing about their return,
as we pout and bemoan that they should</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not have such a celebration since we have been “more”
faithful and “more” obedient than our wayward sibling. We are called to celebrate
the reunion of the repentant with our loving GOD and Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thirdly, we are called to be proactive as a sign of our
joy.  We, like St. Paul, must be ambassadors of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciliation – allowing GOD to appeal to others through
us.  We may be the one and only person who touches the life of a particular
individual so that she/he experiences the joy that GOD is offering to her/him. 
One way we act as ambassadors of the Lord Jesus is by our joy and our
lifestyle.  People should sense that we are delighted to follow the Lord Jesus
and experience a deep sense of joy as we live lives that proclaim the GOoD
News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is true, as those who have seen The Passion of the Christ
can vouch, that what Jesus went through to save was truly excruciating.  We may
be saddened and touched, and even tearful at the agony He suffered.  We may
lament the tragic experiences that He went through.  We, however, cannot just
stop at crucifixion.  We must realize that the crucifixion is tied
intrinsically to the resurrection.  Jesus died so that He might rise for us. 
We must rejoice in the fullness of the paschal mystery of Jesus’ salvific
actions.  We must, as the psalmist proclaims today, “Look to GOD that you may
be radiant with joy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   On this Laetare
Sunday, what gives me reason to rejoice? Do I sense the newness that GOD gives
me as I seek to be new and improved in my own journey of faith?  Do I rejoice
with others who have returned to the loving Abba Who awaits them?   Am I
grateful and joyful to be an Ambassador of Reconciliation to others?  How can I
better be such an Ambassador of Reconciliation to those whose paths I cross
today, this week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all joy.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to announce the joyful GOoD News of
Your love for us.  Not only have You given us life on this earth, but You offer
to us a new creation and new life beyond this earth.  You invite us to come to
You and be reconciled.  Yet, we, like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, have
sometimes chosen to go our own way and squander the gifts You have given us. 
Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, help us to come to our senses and return
to You, as we demonstrate that we are repentant and contrite.  We do not
deserve the joyful celebration that You have in store for us as we make our way
to You.  We can only respond to Your abundant forgiveness by rejoicing in the
love You extend to others as they also return to You.  We thank You for sending
Your Son Jesus to us as the First Ambassador of reconciliation.  We praise You
for allowing us to share in His role of announcing Your loving forgiveness.  To
You be all praise, glory, and honor, as we join the rejoicing of Your Son
Jesus, Who has died,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is risen, and Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only, loving and merciful GOD, forever and ever. 
Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of Fourth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Stephen of Mar Saba:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 65: 17-21;        Psalm 30: 2 and 4, 5-6,
11-12a and 13b;        John 4: 43-54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The promise of a better life takes central stage in our
readings today. Isaiah speaks GOD’s Word announcing a whole new life, a
re-created life, a life without pain and sadness. The Responsorial Psalm is a
prayer of praise, thanking GOD for all that GOD has done. In the Gospel, Jesus
performs a miracle that symbolizes the restored life that awaits all of us if
we believe in the Word of GOD -- both in written form and in the
Word-made-flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through the prophet Isaiah, the LORD promises to create new
heavens and a new earth. This new place will be a place of joy and fullness of
life. In the New Jerusalem there will be no more sadness or mourning. Life will
be GOoD and long.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reminds us to praise GOD for all the great things
GOD has done and is doing, and will do, especially the rescuing of the people
of GOD from the hands of their enemies. We hear that their mourning will be
changed into dancing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, speaks about the lack of faith of the
people. In John’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel, the people of Jerusalem are the ones who reject the
Prophet in His own land. Jesus travels back to Galilee where He performs more
signs of the GOD’s healing presence. Today we hear about the sickness of the
son of a royal official. Jesus says to the official, “Return home,” for He
promises that his boy is well, and the official believes that it has happened.
As the official travels home, he is greeted with the news of the boy’s return
to health at the exact hour when Jesus promised healing of the boy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings speak to me today and they edify me with the
promise of healing and new life. I hear the promise that GOD wants us to
experience a whole, new way of living – a life without sickness and mourning –
a life of joy and dancing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our life on earth is not the fullness of life that GOD has
promised. Like Jesus, we are only traveling through this place, journeying
toward our designated place with GOD our Abba-Father in heaven. Jesus is
leading us back to the place that He has prepared for us in His Abba’s house.
That is the place where there will be no more mourning or sickness or death. We
will live a GOoD and long life – an eternal life with our GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we have traveled past the halfway point of our Lenten
journey, we have also traveled further on our journey home to our Abba’s house.
As we contemplate Jesus’ suffering and death</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and resurrection, we need to think of our own death and
ultimate resurrection. Death is part of our travels here on earth. Death,
however, is not the end. Death is, as a priest friend of mine described it, the
mere folding up of the tent which we have used in our travels here on earth and
the leaving the tent behind as we journey on to the home that Jesus has
prepared for us in His Abba’s house. We will one day be able to once again
pitch our </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tent in heaven and on the new earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question I ask myself today is: “Am I ready to fold up
my tent today if the Lord Jesus asks me to leave it behind and head to my new,
eternal home?” The answer that I should be able to say, “Yes, Jesus, if today
You call me, I am ready.” Being able to answer in that way requires that I need
to have the correct focus in my life right now. I need to be focused not on the
“trappings” that I have acquired for my tent, but on the fact that I will,
sooner or later, have to leave the tent behind and journey on to where a place
has been </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prepared for me in Jesus’ Abba’s house – in our Abba’s
house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to become attached to the belongings that
surround and fill my temporary tent. I want to feel comfortable. I get too used
to being in this tent and lose sight that I am only traveling along and will
have to leave my tent and all of its “trappings” behind. And “trappings” they
can sometimes be. Trappings can mean those items that signify who I am and what
is important to me. Trappings can also mean something else. Trappings can trap
me into focusing my attention on them, rather than on the journey and my final destination
of being home with my Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I keep on hearing the message of Jesus as reiterated by one
of His modern messengers, “Travel with less. Don’t become burdened down with so
much that it will be hard to let it go and move on.” I am challenged to look to
see where my focus is. Is it on obtaining more, having all the trappings I can
for my tent, or is it on the journey and on the people who are journeying with
me? If I keep my eyes on the journey and not on the refinements of my tent, I
will notice that there are others journeying along with me who need my
attention – who want me to be in relationship with them and to help them along.
Although I will have to take that final step across the final bridge by myself,
while I am traveling along, I am called to help others with the journey, help
them carry their load, speak about where we are going, edify them with my
experience of the relationship with our Lord Jesus and His Abba. I also should
be willing to let others share with me and help me when I need assistance as we
travel along the path to the place prepared for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today the challenge before me is to see where I am putting
my attention. I need to get fully back on track. I need to be willing to leave
my tent behind and take the final step across the final bridge on this earth,
if that is what the Lord Jesus is asking of me today. My attitude must be that
of saying, “Jesus, if You want me to come to the new home You have prepared for
me, I am ready. And if You don’t, then I will keep on traveling along the path
with those whom You have put on the journey with me, encouraging and building
them up, helping them with their journey, telling the stories of Your GOoD
News, stories that keep them (and me) focused on Your message and inspiring
them (and me) to look</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>towards the place You have prepared for all of us in our
Abba’s house.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What am I doing to
show my belief in the promise of a better life? How attached am I to my tent
and all its trappings? Am I willing to have my tent folded up and move on to
the place that has been prepared for me in my Abba’s house? How can I assist
those who are the journey with me so that they will keep their eyes focus on
our eternal and joy-filled destination – the place Jesus has prepared for us –
the gift that Jesus has given to us through His death and resurrection?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Parent-Abba-Father.
Through Your GOoDness and through Your Son, Jesus, You continue to call us
home, to Your house where a place has been prepared for us. As we travel along
our way to You, we often get caught up in filling our tent with all sorts of
trappings. We spend our time and energy on our equipment, rather than focusing
our attention on the destination and the process of journeying along. We
sometimes forget those who are journeying along with us, because we are focused
so much on our own tent. We fail to see that others need our help with their
travel. Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, fill us with wisdom and courage
so that we can keep our focus on our destination – being home with You and Your
Son in the unity of the Holy Spirit. Give us the strength we need each day to
not only take the steps we need to move on towards our heavenly home, but also
to inspire and encourage our fellow travelers. We thank You for those who have
helped us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>get back on track and have pointed out to us the Way. We
particular think of those who have completed their journey and are already home
with You. We know that they are still in relationship with us, since they are
one with You, as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are hopefully one with You. As always, we come before You
in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Who is the Way back to You, and Who is the
Travel Guide for our path, and He is the One Who opened the doors to Your house
through His death and resurrection, and He is the One Who is living and
reigning in Your house with You and the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of Fourth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Hugh of Grenoble:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Ezekiel 47: 1-9, 12;        Psalm 46: 2-3, 5-6,
8-9;       John 5: 1-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Water. The basis of life. Water can destroy and can give
life. Water is the common item flowing through our readings today. Let’s jump
in and see how the water is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the reading from Ezekiel, the prophet sees water flowing
from the base of the temple in Jerusalem. Having been in Jerusalem and seen the
topography of the hill on which the temple was built, I can picture water
flowing from the south and east sides of the temple down the step canyon toward
the southeast and eventually down to the Arabah (the Jordan River Valley) and
finally into the Dead Sea, the salt waters. As the prophet walks along the little
trickle of water gains volume and flow. It is first just a little stream of
water. It becomes ankle deep, then knee deep, then waist deep, then a huge
river that can only be crossed by swimming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the water flows out in the parched and barren land to the
east</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and south, it gives life to all sorts of plants and animals
that are nearby. As it flows into the Dead Sea it brings life. This water which
began at the house of GOD gains power and truly gives life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One verse in today’s psalm speaks about the “stream whose
runlets gladden the city of GOD, the holy dwelling of the Most High.” Again, it
is the water that gives life to those in GOD’s presence. It is the water
flowing from GOD that makes people aware of GOD’s life-giving power and
presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus comes to Bethesda. According to one
tradition, an angel of GOD would stir the waters of the Sheep Pool at Bethesda
and whoever would get into the water after the stirring by the angel would be
healed. [Aside:  the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>military hospital near Washington, D. C. is called Bethesda
because of the reference to the Biblical place of healing.  At our parish we
have the Bethesda Ministry whose ministers reach out to the sick and brings
them the Word of GOD, the Eucharist, and a sense of community.]  It is here at
the ancient Bethesda Pool that Jesus meets a man who had been waiting by the
pool for thirty-eight years, but who has had no one to help him into the water.
Jesus provides the healing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we journey along our Lenten paths I think of the
life-giving and healing waters of Baptism. Traditionally the Church has used
Lent as the final preparation period (Purification and Enlightenment) for those
who would be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>welcomed into the Church through the waters of Baptism at
the Easter Vigil. In some churches, the water fonts during Lent are dry. At the
Easter Vigil, new water is blessed for the first time. This new water that will
be used in Baptism, not just at the Easter Vigil but throughout the year. All
of us will be invited to renew our baptismal promises and be blessed by the new
Easter water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago, I was privileged to share the meaning of
water and Baptism with a group of adults as part of a Lenten series. I also
spoke to those in our faith community who were to be baptized at the Easter
Vigil. I was using the readings for the Third Sunday of Lent – “A” Cycle – the
woman at the well in John 4. I have continued to reflect on the meaning of
water: it can destroy life by drowning and floods (recall that all life was
destroyed except Noah and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>his family and the animals in the Ark when they survived the
great Flood, Genesis 9). In the past few years, hurricanes have traveled
through the South and up to the Northeast, dumping the most rain for one day in
New Jersey and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>flooding New York City. I have relatives who were in Florida
when Hurricane Ian destroyed many homes and buildings in 2022.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Water can also cleanse and purify; it can give life. It is
one of the most essential molecules needed for life. I know of a ranch in
southern Arizona which is usually dry in the summer; but a few summers ago, it
received continual monsoon rain and was greener than ever. The Lord Jesus has
chosen this essential item to be used during baptism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baptism, by the way, literally means “plunging” into water.
As we are baptized, we are “plunged” into death – death of our old sinful
selves, death to our former way of life, united with the death that Jesus
underwent. As we come forth from the depths of our “plunging,” we are raised to
new life – life with the Risen Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Lenten journey, we should take time to
reflect on our own Baptism. We should renew the commitments we, or our parents
and godparents speaking for us, made at our Baptism. We renounced sin and evil
and professed our faith in a GOD Who is Father (Abba), creator; in a GOD Who is
savior and redeemer and ultimate victor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the battle against evil; in a GOD Who enlightens and
enlivens our life by breathing the divine Ruah (Spirit, breath, wind, air) into
us. At our Baptism, we united ourselves with other believers in a community of
faith. We (or our parents/godparents) made a commitment to that community, and
the community committed themselves to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am always enriched and re-enlivened as we celebrate the
welcoming of new members into the Body of Christ at the Easter Vigil. My faith
is renewed and re-enkindled as I see individuals joyfully commit themselves,
freely and without reservations, to being members of GOD’s holy people. For
many years, I have had the privilege to work with those who are being welcomed
into the Family of GOD at the Easter Vigil. It is so enriching to hear the
stories of their faith journeys that have led to their wanting to be active
participants in the Church of GOD. It always gives me renewed hope and greater
desire to live out my own relationship with the Lord Jesus that began at my
Baptism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The power flowing from the waters of Baptism should not be
decreasing over the years but increasing, just as the water seen by the prophet
Ezekiel gained strength as it flowed from the temple out into the desert. We
should be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gaining more enthusiasm (en theos – “in GOD”-ness) and more
life as the waters of Baptism flow through us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we all take the time to reflect on the spiritual
relationship with GOD that began when we were welcomed into the community of
faith at our Baptism. May we once again be clothed with Christ and be
enlightened by the Light Who is Jesus. May we feel the new life of the Holy
Spirit that comes from the waters flowing from GOD. And may we be the means
that GOD uses to draw others to the water and so they can experience the
life-giving and healing power of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How am I living
out my Baptism and my Baptismal Promises?  Do I sense the life-giving power
flowing from the waters of my Baptism?  What can I do to invite others to drink
more abundantly from the waters that flow from the presence of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all-knowing and ever wise. 
Through Your GOoDness, You choose the simple union of two atoms of hydrogen and
an one atom of oxygen to be joined together to form the molecule of water.  You
have made that molecule be a key ingredient in the process of life.  You then
give new meaning to that substance by allowing it to symbolize the flow of Your
life within our very being.  You have used water throughout our human history
to speak of Your creation, Your saving of Noah, his family, and all living
creatures.  You parted the water of the Red Sea to bring Your chosen people out
of slavery and start their journey to the Promised Land.  You allowed water to
flow from a rock to bring life to a community in the barren desert.  You
brought Your people through the waters of the River Jordan into the land You
were giving them, a land flowing with milk and honey.  At the time of Jesus’
death on the cross, blood and water flowed from His side as the final sign of
His willingness to die so that we might have life.  After His resurrection,
Your Son commissioned His followers to use the waters of Baptism to welcome new
members into a community of faith and relationship with You and Your Son and
Your Holy Spirit.  Give us the desire to take the time to experience this life-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>giving substance and be renewed in our relationship with
You.  May we continue to allow water remind us of our death to sin and evil and
the new life we experience in Your Risen Son.   May we rejoice with those whom
You welcome into Your family through the waters of Baptism. We give You glory
and praise for the gift of life-giving water that not only brings life to our
earthly bodies, but also brings eternal life to our eternal relationship with
You.  As always, we lift up to You this prayer of praise and thanks, in and
through Your Son, our Lord, Jesus the Christ, Who is living and reigning with
You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of Fourth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Francis of Paola)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Francis of Paola:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-francis-of-paola</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 49: 8-15;        Psalm 145: 8-9, 13-14,
17-18;         John 5: 17-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hope comes through today’s readings.  In the First Reading,
Isaiah is speaking to those in exile, reassuring them with GOD’s Word, the Word
that reminds the people that GOD will restore them to the Promised Land and
will provide for them on their journey back home.  GOD will care for the Chosen
People more than a loving mother cares for the child of her womb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reminds us that the LORD is kind and merciful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The LORD is faithful to the promises made and is
compassionate toward the people of GOD.  For “the LORD is near to all who call
upon the LORD, to all who call upon the LORD in truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, speaks about the close relationship He
has with His Abba-Father.  The religious</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leaders pick up on the fact that He is putting Himself on
the same level as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, and therefore they consider Him a heretic and someone
Who must be removed.  Jesus expands upon His relationship with His Abba, saying
that He is totally in sync with His Abba’s will, and He will bring eternal life
to all who also seek to do the will of the His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hope I sense in the readings comes from knowing that GOD
wants the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>best for us.  Isaiah reminds us that even if a mother could
forget the child to whom she has given life, GOD will never forget us.  Even
though events and circumstances in our life seem to be going poorly, GOD is
still with us and will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bring us home.  GOD wants to give us the very best.  That is
the hope to which we need to cling, especially when we face trying times. 
Isaiah was speaking these words to people who had been led away in exile.  They
had experienced the darkest days of their lives.  Isaiah was comforting them
with the promise that GOD would take care of them, nourish them, and lead them
back.  Yes, in some ways the exile was a result of the people’s unfaithfulness,
but GOD was not going to hold that against them forever, as some of the people
thought.  If they turn to GOD and seek the divine will in their lives, GOD will
be there for them and lead them back to the Promised Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I guess I need to be attuned to that message right now.  We
all have had a trying few years with the pandemic, civil unrest, fires,
hurricanes, political tensions, and world-wide conflicts and wars.  The
youngest cousin on my father’s side of the family suffered from a major stroke
and mental losses, and he died.  One of my closest high school classmates also had
a series of strokes, while another close classmate is in a mental facility.  A
niece lost her boyfriend when he was walking along a road and was hit by a
car.  Other people I know are facing financial problems, especially as we have
seen in the rising of prices for fuel and food over the last years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humanly speaking, I don’t know how they are coping with the
upheavals in their lives.  What can I say to them? I need to reassure them of
hope.  I seek to encourage them to keep their eyes focused on the Lord Jesus
and His message.  I want to send the same message to them that Isaiah spoke to
the people in exile.  GOD will restore and lift up all who seek GOD, for, as
the psalm remind us, “the LORD is kind and merciful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus also speaks of GOD’s sending the very best, especially
to those who turn to GOD for help.  GOD the Abba-Father sent the Son, the very
best – the One Who is in total relationship with the Abba.  The Son seeks to do
the will of His Abba and that means giving life to those who put their faith in
the One sent by the Abba.  Jesus </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speaks of restoring to life to those who are dead.  I see
this referring not just to those who are physically dead, but to those who seem
to be experiencing a death in certain aspects of their lives.  Jesus promises
to bring life to those who seem lifeless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the message all of us need to hear, especially if we
are going through a period in our lives when everything seems to be dying.  GOD
is offering us hope and life.  This is the message we need to share with those
going through rough times, whether that be sickness, surgery, loved ones who
are aging and not acting like themselves, changes in job status, people facing
false accusations against them, relational problems, financial difficulties,
concerns for members of their families who are experiencing difficulties, or a
combination of two more of the above.   No matter what seems to be weighing us
down, GOD is offering us hope and the promise that GOD will bring us home.  All
we need do is turn more fully toward our GOD and call upon the Lord Jesus in
truth.  Yes, we must admit if we may have missed the mark (sinned), and we must</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>express our desire to get back on target.  If we cry out,
trusting in the mercy of GOD, GOD will restore us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus came to remind us of the love that the Abba-Father has
for us.  Let us, with hope, cling to the truth of GOD’s love.  Let us take
seriously Jesus’ words:  “I solemnly assure you, the one who hears My Word and
has faith in the One Who sent me, possesses eternal life. . .has passed from
death to life.”  This is promise of the Best One sent by the heavenly Abba, Who
loves us more than a mother loves the child whom she has carried within her for
nine months.  Let us cling to this hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  As I reflect on
GOD’s Word in Isaiah about GOD’s never forgetting us, even if a mother could
forget the child of her womb, what are my thoughts? When I think of the love
GOD has for us manifested through the sending of the Very Best One – Jesus – how
do I respond?  How can I reassure others with the hope of their being loved by
a GOD Who is more loving than any human parent is for her/his child(ren)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving, kind, merciful, and
just.  Through Your GOoDness and love, You speak of Your closeness to us by
saying You love us more than a mother loves her child, the fruit of her womb.
You have given us the very best by sending us Your Son, Jesus.  Jesus comes to
us while we are sinners.  He has come to us because we have been out of
relationship with You.  He promises to share eternal life with us, if we but
believe that He is the One Whom You have sent.  He reassures us that Your plan
is that we journey home to You.  Through the gifts of wisdom and understanding
and self-examination given by Your Holy Spirit, help us to call upon You in
truth, admitting our failings and seeking Your mercy.  May we also remind
others of Your promises and give them hope, especially as they walk the paths
that seem dark and lifeless.  May we be to them the signs of hope, so that they
will turn more fully toward You and accept the message that Your Son brought to
us.  As always, we give You all the glory, honor, and praise for never giving
up on us and fulfilling Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promise to bring us home to You.  We lift up this prayer in
union with Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Benedict the African:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 32: 7-14;        Psalm 106: 19-20, 21-22,
23;         John 5: 31-47</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides GOD, the common figure in the readings today is
Moses.  Moses was not only considered the one who led the people from slavery,
but also the one who defended the people when GOD wanted to punish them for
their infidelity.  Moses was also the presenter of the Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading presents Moses pleading with GOD on
behalf of the people, asking GOD to forgive their sin and relent punishing
them.  Moses is conscious of the promises that GOD had made and invokes those
promises so that the people might be spared from the wrath of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes this story of the people’s creating a golden
calf and Moses’ interceding with GOD on behalf of the people.  We hear, “Then
GOD spoke of exterminating them, but Moses, GOD’s chosen one, withstood GOD in
the breach to turn back the divine destructive wrath.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus also speaks about Moses in today’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel account.  This time, Moses is not the one to speak on
behalf of the unfaithful, but to condemn those who do not believe in Jesus. 
Jesus tells the disbelieving people:  “The one to accuse you is Moses on whom
you have set your hopes.  If you believed Moses, you would then believe Me, for
it was about Me that he wrote.  But if you do not believe what he wrote, how
can you believe what I say?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moses is both defender and accuser.  What is the difference
in his positions. As I reflect on the readings, I see a difference in the
motive and disposition of the people.  In the passage from Exodus, the people
have not had the time to develop a clear understanding of their relationship
with GOD.  They have just been set free from slavery.  They have not heard all
of the teachings that Moses will give to them over the next 40 years.  They
want to worship GOD by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>creating an image of GOD, but they misunderstand who GOD is
because they have only begun their relationship with GOD.  They know that their
former enslavers had images and statues of their gods.  The Israelites think
they should have an image to represent their GOD, so they choose a molten image
of a calf.  They are children who needed boundaries so that they can be safe in
their childlike relationship with GOD Whom they are only beginning to know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people about whom Jesus speaks in today’s Gospel are
those who have had years of studying GOD’s Word as given by Moses.  They have
had time to develop a relationship with GOD, and they refuse to understand what
GOD has spoken through Moses and through the prophets and other true leaders of
the faith. They fail to be open to the revelation of GOD’s presence.  Most
importantly they do not accept Jesus as GOD’s Anointed One (the Messiah – the
Christ).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It goes back to people’s orientation.  The Israelites during
the time of Moses are trying to be ad Deum (heading toward GOD), but they miss
the mark (they sin).  They do not fully understand Who GOD is.  They desire to
have a tangible relationship with GOD, but they are misguided in thinking that
building a golden statue will help them in this relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people in Jesus’ day, even though they think they are ad
Deum, they are not only missing the mark a little bit, but they were a theos –
working against GOD.  They refuse to even try to understand Jesus’ role in
GOD’s plan of salvation.  They are working against the proclamation of the GOoD
News of GOD as announced by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus.  They cannot see GOD acting in Jesus.  They have
become so locked into their own (mis)understanding of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, and how GOD should act according to their
(mis)understanding, that they cannot be open to Jesus and His ministry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With whom do we identify? Are we, like the Israelites,
trying to deepen our relationship with GOD, but who are a little off track in
our understanding? Or are we like the people of Jesus’ day who refuse to see
the message of Jesus? Mostly likely, we are the former.  We get a little
side-tracked in our understanding of the GOD Whom Jesus reveals to us.  We
start to build our own image of Who GOD is, rather than being open to the image
of GOD that Jesus reveals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge that I take from the readings today is to
examine my relationship with GOD and see if I have misunderstood the GOoD News
Jesus has proclaimed.  I know I sometimes become sidetracked by trying to fit
GOD into my plans, instead of trying to see how I can fit into GOD’s plan.  I
fail to see how GOD is working in my life and how GOD is revealing to me the
divine, loving relationship with me.  I seek instead to try to convince GOD
what I think GOD should do.  At other times, I look at who I think I am and
what I have done, but I fail to reflect on Who GOD is and what GOD is doing. 
Let us pray that we may be open to GOD’s movement among us, especially as
revealed through the teaching and ministry, the life and death and
resurrection, of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my attitude
toward GOD as I look at my relationship with the Lord Jesus? Do I sometimes
find myself off track and miss GOD’s self-revelation? What have I done with the
GOoD News that Jesus has shared with me? How will my being open to GOD’s
message affect the way I treat others today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever present and always revealing
Yourself to us.  Through Your GOoDness, You call us into a closer relationship
with You.  You invite us to open our eyes and see You as Your Son reveals You
to us.  Even though we seek to deepen our relationship with You, we often are
side-tracked and fall off the path.  You are willing to help us pick ourselves
up and start us along the right path again (and again).  Loving GOD, help us
never be so off track that we begin working against You and refuse to accept
Your loving and forgiving relationship.  Through Your Holy Spirit, give us the
strength we need to admit our missing the mark and turn more fully to seeking
Your way.  We thank You for Your being patient with us as we stumble along the
way that leads to You.  We praise You for sending us Your Son, Jesus, Who is
the Way, the Truth, and the Life. It is in His name that we lift this prayer of
praise and thanks to You.  For Jesus is Your Son, our Brother and Savior and
Master-Teacher, Who has revealed You to us and Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.   <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of Fourth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Isidore of Seville)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Isidore of Seville:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 2: 1a, 12-22;      Psalm 34: 17-18, 19-20,
21, 23;      John 7: 1-2, 10, 25-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On this Friday of Lent, we sense the impending suffering and
death of Jesus.  We realize that His “hour of glory” (as St. John calls it
throughout his Gospel) is coming, but not quite yet.  Jesus’ preaching is
challenging His adversaries, and they seek ways to destroy Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading from the Book of Wisdom is truly
appropriate as we reflect on how the religious leaders react to Jesus.  Today’s
passage speaks of wicked individuals plotting against “the Just One” because
they are threatened by what the Just One teaches.  The Just One is a Son of GOD
and calls GOD His Abba-Father.  The wicked realize their own evil and rather than
change in response to the teaching of the Just One, they decide to get rid of
the Just</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our psalm reminds us that GOD is near to those who call upon
the name of the LORD, and GOD will redeem the lives of the servants of the LORD
– those who seek to do GOD’s will in spite of opposition from the wicked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Jesus senses the opposition from the
religious leadership.  At first, He tries to be a little less obvious in His
proclamation of the GOoD News during a Jewish autumn festival of Sukkoth or
Tabernacles (Booths/Tents) in Jerusalem, but He ends up speaking openly.  Yet,
since His hour of glory is not fully upon Him, He is not apprehended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these readings, I ponder how people react</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to Jesus, the truly Just One, the true Son of GOD.  He comes
to speak the Light of the Truth, since He is the Light and the Truth (cf. John
11: 25 and John 14: 6).  Those who walk in darkness and lies, however, cannot
handle the Light and the Truth.  Rather than change from their way of wickedness,
darkness, and lies, they try to do away with the Just One.  As I meditate on
how those who are steeped in doing wrong are challenged by those who honestly
speak of righteous ways, I realize that it is not that the righteous are
seeking to condemn the wicked, but to move them to conversion of heart.  Yet,
by the wicked choosing to stay in their darkness, they become more devious in
their lifestyle, plotting to destroy those who challenge their evil ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sometimes wonder if I am doing enough to proclaim the
Light and the Truth.  If I am truly seeking to be a child of GOD, then my life
should be a challenge for those not walking the way that leads to the Light and
the Truth.  I should be facing opposition from those who are opposed to GOD’s
way.  Maybe I am not living a life that reflects Gospel values enough that
would make me be a threat to those refusing to walk in GOD’s way.  Or maybe I
am surrounding myself with people who are at least open to hearing GOD’s
message rather than people who would be challenged by the Truth.  I am not
asking to be persecuted, but am I trying too hard to remain hidden rather than
come out in the open and profess my faith in the Truth and the Light?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings move me to realize how much Jesus has
experienced during His earthly life because of His commitment to the
proclaiming the GOoD News of His Abba-Father.  He so much wants people to
deepen their relationship with GOD, that He becomes a source of opposition to
those choosing to remain alienated from </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  He senses how His teaching the Truth could be opposed
by the people who chose to remain with the father of lies.  He knows He will
have to suffer at the hands of the wicked in order to bring salvation and
redemption to those willing to be children of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus is seen in the Gospels, He is willing to challenge
people with the Light and the Truth, even if it means His own persecution.  He
is confident in His relationship with His Abba.  He knows that GOD, His Abba,
will watch over Him even in the midst of opposition, suffering, and death.  He
realizes that His “hour of glory” would include both His crucifixion and His
resurrection and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is willing to proclaim the message until that hour comes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I move forward in more boldly, yet lovingly, proclaiming
the Light and Truth, I, too, can expect resistance and opposition.  If I, like
Jesus, can keep my eyes focused on the Light and the Truth, then I can be
reassured that the Lord Jesus will hear me and protect me, even if I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am persecuted and have to suffer, for as the psalm today
proclaims:   “When the just cry out, the LORD hears them, and from all their
distress, the LORD rescues them.  The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; and
those who are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>crushed in spirit GOD saves.  Many are the troubles of the
just, but out of them all the LORD delivers them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I sometimes put
down or seek to oppose those who challenge me when I do not live up to my call
to be a disciple of the Lord Jesus? Am I so committed to proclaiming the Light
and the Truth that I am willing to suffer at the hands of those who seek only
darkness and lies? How can I be more conscious of my call to proclaim the GOoD
News to others, even in the face of opposition?  How can I be supportive of
those who are being persecuted for their living out the Truth in word and
action?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever truthful and enlightening. 
Through Your GOoDness, You love us enough to send to us Your Son, Jesus, to
proclaim Your message of Truth and Light.  Those who choose to walk in darkness
and lies cannot handle the Truth and Light.  Your Son, Jesus, was willing to
face opposition, suffering, and death in order to proclaim Your GOoD News of
relationship, joy, love, and eternal life.  May we be transformed by the Gospel
Truth and be enlightened by the true Light so that we may turn more fully
toward You.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, strengthen us and give us
the wisdom to speak the Truth in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>face of falsehood, to reflect the Light into the darkness. 
Enable us to face any opposition that comes from living lives that are in
conformity with Your will.  May we accept rejection (from those who walk in
lies and darkness) as a sign of blessing from You for our living according to
the Way of Your Son.  Help us to reflect more deeply on all that Jesus
experienced in order that He might bring us Your invitation to a closer
relationship with You.  As always, we make this prayer in the name of the Lord
Jesus, the Christ, Your Son and our Brother, the Way, the Truth, the Light, and
the Life, Who is living and reigning with You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of Fourth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Vincent Ferrer)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Vincent Ferrer:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-vincent-ferrer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Jeremiah 11: 18-20;        Psalm 7: 2-3, 9bc-10,
11-12;         John 7: 40-53Our readings continue to relate how the wicked
people (religious leaders) plot against the Just One (Jesus). We can sense that
things are approaching the climax, or as John relates, the “Hour of Glory,”
culminating in the death (and resurrection) of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jeremiah is a type (a prefigurement) of Jesus.  In today’s
First Reading, he realizes that those who are opposed to his teaching are
plotting against him, just as the religious leaders of Jesus’ time plot against
Him.  Yet, “like a trusting lamb led to the slaughter,” he is willing to go
forward, trusting in a GOD Who is just, and Who will be with Jeremiah through
the thick and thin of events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm speaks about putting hope in GOD Who will save us
from our enemies and be with us.  It resonates with the lives of both Jeremiah
and Jesus and their relying on the justice of GOD in the face of persecution
from those who seek the life of the just and innocent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel from St. John, we hear about some of the
people drawing ever closer to Jesus, believing that He is a prophet or the
Messiah (Christ).  The religious leadership continues to be opposed to Jesus,
trying to find all sorts of reasons to show that He is not what the people
think He is.  They say that, if He were the Messiah, He would be from
Bethlehem, not a region of the Galilee.  They question the temple guards on why
they have not yet arrested Him.  The guards respond by saying that no one has
ever spoken like Jesus, and they are mesmerized.  The majority of the religious
leaders unite in opposition against Jesus.  Apparently only Nicodemus raises
challenges to their plans of getting rid of Jesus, and he is put down for his
trying to defend Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Lenten journey, we are led to focus on
the impending events culminating in Jesus’ suffering and death.  We hear about
the plots against His life.  We realize how much He is willing to endure in
order to bring GOD’s message of love and forgiveness, GOD’s GOoD News of
renewed relationship between GOD and the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My attention today focuses on the person of Nicodemus.  He
is a Pharisee who is intrigued by the teaching of Jesus.  In the third chapter
of St. John’s Gospel, Nicodemus seeks out Jesus at night, trying to learn more
about Him.  Nicodemus wants to believe, but he is afraid to reveal his desire
to accept Jesus and His teaching.  Jesus invites Nicodemus into a closer
relationship by speaking of being “born anothev-again” (or “born anothen-from
above”).  Jesus tells Nicodemus that the reason that He is on His mission is to
make known to the world how much GOD loves each person in the world.  Jesus
speaks about how many people prefer to live in darkness rather than to believe
in the Light of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Nicodemus tries to defend Jesus, even
though he does it under the pretense of being concerned about upholding the
Jewish law that does not condemn a person until all facts are known.  Nicodemus
today is challenged, for some of his fellow Pharisees sense that he might be
siding with Jesus.  They taunt him about his possibly being a follower of
Jesus.  We do not have an account of how Nicodemus reacted to the taunting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nicodemus again appears on GOoD Friday (John 19: 39f).  We
see him attending to the dead body of Jesus after the crucifixion.  He helps in
the preparation rites for Jesus’ burial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nicodemus’ journey of faith goes through a process of first
being curious about Jesus and His teaching.  He comes in the darkness and
experiences the Light of Christ (John 3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He starts to be convinced about Who Jesus is, but he still
is not willing to step out in faith.  When he senses that he should speak up to
defend Jesus in today’s Gospel, he does not boldly speak out, but tries to give
Jesus a break in an inadvertent way by appealing to the Jewish judicial
system.  He still does not have </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the courage to face the opposition that he would encounter
by openly professing his faith in Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, the death of Jesus leads Nicodemus to be willing to
take action, not caring what others will say about him.  He is committed to
doing what is right.  He spends his own money to purchase what is necessary to
do what is right for the crucified Body of Jesus.  He professes his faith in
action by ministering to the Body of Christ.  He is willing to face opposition
from his confreres (John 19).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This leads me to ask where am I in my faith journey? Am I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>like Nicodemus in John 3? Am I curious? Do I come in the
darkness so that no one will know that I want to learn more about Jesus and
develop a relationship with Him? Am I sometimes afraid to let others know that I
am interested in Jesus and His teaching?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes I may be like Nicodemus in John 7 (today’s Gospel
reading).  I am convinced but afraid.  I may be willing to speak up about a
wrong being done to a just and faith-filled person, but in a round-about way. 
I may present my views couched in other words, so as not to tip my hand to my
real beliefs.  I am not willing to face opposition, and when I am challenged, I
try to quietly melt into the background.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, I am called to take action in my life, as Nicodemus did
after the death of Jesus.  I must be willing to be committed – to openly and
boldly profess my faith in Jesus.  I must minister to the Body of Jesus (His
sistersand brothers who are united with Jesus the Head).  I must do what I can
to show my concern for those who have been persecuted or who need my help.  I
must use my resources to do what is right for the whole Body of Jesus (His
believers), even if others will criticize me for my action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge before me today is to become committed to Jesus
and His cause – to get involved in defending Christ Jesus Who is suffering and
being condemned and persecuted and is facing death in the members of His Body. 
I am called to profess my faith in words and actions, to walk in the Light
rather than in darkness.  I am being asked to demonstrate my relationship with
the Jesus and His mission, even if it means I will have to face opposition.  I
must stand up for what I know is right in the face of those who choose to do
wrong.  It is not an easy task.  I may feel like Jeremiah, like a trusting lamb
led to the slaughter, but if I trust in the “GOD Who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>saves” (Yeshua – Jesus), I will experience the divine
presence with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Where am I in my
following Jesus? Am I still in the curiosity stage? Have I moved to being
convinced, but not sure how to act? Am I committed to following my
Master-Teacher no matter where that may lead me? How am I going to stand up for
the Body of Christ today?  What am I going to do to show my relationship to
Jesus and to those who are united with Him? How can I boldly walk in the Light
today? How can I better meet the needs of the whole Body of Christ – the
community of the faithful?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and challenging. 
Through Your GOoDness, You invite us to come to Jesus and develop our
relationship with Him.  You have put the desire in our hearts to learn from
Him, for He is meek and humble of heart.  We ask for Your forgiveness for the
times we have not fully stood up for our relationship with You and Your Son. 
Send us a further outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, Who strengthens us and guides
us, so that we can stand up for what is right.  Deepen our faith so we can
boldly profess the Lord Jesus. Help us to reach out, not worrying about the
cost, to minister to the Body of Your Son in His suffering sisters and
brothers.  And may we give You all glory and praise as we demonstrate our faith
relationship with You, Your Son, and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifth Sunday in Lent – A Cycle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Used particularly in Liturgies that have the Third Scrutiny
of the Elect)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Crescentia Hoess:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ezekiel 37: 12-14;     Psalm 130: 1-2, 3-4, 5-6,
7-8;     Romans 8: 8-11;     John 11: 1-45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From GOD’s promise of restoring life in Ezekiel, through
Saint Paul’s reminder that our mortal bodies will be brought to life, to Jesus’
raising Lazarus from the dead, the theme of new life reverberates loudly. GOD
wants</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us to have life – the fullness of life – eternal life –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life from, with, and of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ezekiel reminds the people who are in exile that even though
it seems like they have no life, GOD promises to breathe the divine life back
into them and raise them to new life. Even those who are dead and buried are
being called from the grave to life with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm 130 promises fullness of redemption to those who trust
in the LORD. With the LORD there is life. Without the LORD there is only death,
and death to all relationships.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul reminds us that we are called not to live in the
flesh – the sinful ways of the world – but to live in the Spirit, the Spirit
Who raised Jesus from the dead and Who will also raise our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mortal bodies to eternal life. We need to die to our life of
sin and be raised to the new life and full relationship with GOD, in and
through Jesus and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Gospel passage today is the story of the raising of
Lazarus. As typical of St. John’s writing, there is much for us to ponder.
Jesus, from the beginning of the passage, realizes that Lazarus will be raised
from the dead for the purpose of glorifying GOD. Jesus is willing to risk being
arrested in order to bring life to one whom He loves. Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speaks of death as slumber from which Lazarus must be
awaken. Jesus shows true compassion for (“suffering with”) Mary and Martha in
their time of grief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Martha, although upset that Jesus did not come sooner,
professes her belief in “the resurrection on the last day.” Jesus proclaims
that He is the Resurrection and the Life, and that those who believe in Him
will have life even if they are dead. Martha declares her faith in Jesus as the
Son of GOD. Mary also expresses her displeasure (anger?) that Jesus did not
arrive in time to prevent Lazarus’ death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is moved to tears as He sees how Mary, Martha, and
their friends are grieving at the death of Lazarus. When Jesus asks that the
stone be removed from the entrance to the tomb, practical Martha warns Jesus
about the stench from a body that has been decomposing for four days. Jesus
calls Lazarus forth and commands those nearby to unbind Lazarus and permit him
to be free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This passage lends itself to great reflections that could
fill the pages of a book. One such reflection could focus on Jesus’ love for
Lazarus and his sisters. Jesus has already developed a close relationship with
the three members of this family. He has spent time with them. They have tended
to His needs, and He has blessed them with many hours of sharing the GOoD News.
They have listened attentively to His message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus uses the occasion of Lazarus’ deadly sickness to show
how much His </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father and He love not only Lazarus, but Mary and
Martha – and, in turn, each one of us. Jesus knows it is part of His Abba’s
plan to give life, full life, resurrected life to those who believe in Him.
This new and restored life is all part of the ever-deepening covenant
relationship that the Lord Jesus wants with the beloved of GOD – Lazarus,
Martha, and Mary – and us. It is also a foreshadowing of the new life Jesus
would bring through His own resurrection from the dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the things that strikes me is that I am no less loved
by Jesus than Lazarus, Martha, and Mary are loved by Him. Jesus wants as close
a relationship with me as He has with the three siblings of today’s Gospel. And
just as He challenges Mary and Martha to believe in Him Who is the Resurrection
and the Life, He also asks me to profess my faith in Him. Jesus is waiting for
me to say the words which Martha spoke: “Yes, Lord, I have come to believe that
You are the Messiah, the Son of GOD – He Who is to come into the world.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also reminded that Jesus wants me to have such a
relationship with Him that I can express my disappointment with GOD when things
do not go as I plan – as long as I ultimately profess my faith in Jesus,
trusting that with GOD there is mercy and fullness of redemption
(Responsorial). I also have come to the realization that Jesus will be with me
during my times of grief and sorrow, compassionately weeping with me as I
experience losses in my life. I will not be alone or without help, for Jesus
will be there to comfort me as He comforts and weeps with Martha and Mary in
today’ Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also am touched thinking about the fact that Jesus wants
to call me forth from my apparently deadly attitude and invite me to the
fullness of life, not just at the resurrection on the last day, but right now
as I journey along my way to GOD (First Reading). I have the thought that just
as Jesus has other people involved in cutting the bonds that hold Lazarus, so
that Lazarus can be free; so also, Jesus places people in my life to help me
when I am held bound by restricting issues that prevent me from being free. And
similarly, I am to help others who are bound with various ties that prevent
them from full life now and in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The powerful message that rings out from the readings today
is simply that Jesus loves me no less than He loves Lazarus, Martha, and Mary.
Jesus wants me to be in as close a relationship as He has with the three
members of the household of Bethany. Jesus wants to share the fullness of life
with me – right now, not just at the end of my life. All I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>need to do is to put my trust in the Lord Jesus and give
praise and glory to His Abba – my Abba. What a powerful thought. I am humbled
and feel loved. I want to respond by living not in my sinful way (the way of
the flesh) but in the Spirit (Second Reading). Praise be GOD for sending Jesus to
proclaim this message to me – and to you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my attitude
when I experience grief in my life? Do I become angry with GOD so much so that
I turn away from the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father? Do I express my feelings
and also profess my faith that GOD loves me and will give me (and my loved
ones) restored life? How is my relationship with GOD right now? Do I trust GOD
and profess my belief in GOD, even though I don’t see the light of new life?
How can I comfort others who are experiencing pain, dying, and/or grief? How
can I assure them of the eternal life that GOD wants them and/or their loved
ones to have?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever alive and always living.
Through Your GOoDness, You have desired that we humans share in Your life. From
the first moments of creation, You have breathed Your Spirit into the clay of
the earth, and have enlivened flesh with Your Spirit. Even when sin damaged our
relationship with You, You did not turn Your back on us, even though we
partially or fully had turned our back on You through our sinning. You promised
to send One Who would restore life to our dying flesh. You kept Your promise in
the sending of Your Son, Jesus. He lived a life that proclaimed, and still
proclaims, Your desire that we have life – life to the fullest. He was willing
to walk with us, sharing our sorrows and pains, even dying Himself as a sign of
Your wanting us to have life – life now and even a better life for eternity.
His raising of Lazarus and His own resurrection renew Your covenant promise,
and our hope, of the eternal life and everlasting relationship with You. May
we, together with Jesus Your Son, give You glory and praise as we experience
the fullness of life You offer us. As always, we make this prayer in the name
of the Lord Jesus, Your Son, the Resurrection and the Life, Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.
Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifth Sunday in Lent - “C” Cycle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Crescentia Hoess:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 43: 16-21;    Psalm 126: 1-2, 2-3, 4-5,
6;     Philippians 3: 8-14;     John 8: 1-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which way do you look most often? Do you look only backward
at what has been, or do you look forward to what lies ahead? These questions
flow from the readings today. Isaiah reminds the faithful that they should not
just be looking at what GOD has done, but also they must also realize that GOD
is still very active in their lives and will continue to be active. The
Responsorial Psalm is a call to rejoice in what GOD is doing right now. In
today’s part of his letter to the Philippians, St. Paul realizes he has come a
long way in his faith journey, but he still has farther to go and further to
grow. In the Gospel, Jesus encounters the woman caught in adultery. When
questioned about the sinfulness of the woman, Jesus raises issues that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make her accusers leave her alone and allow Jesus to
challenge the woman to move on from this experience to a new way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through Isaiah, GOD speaks to the Babylonian exiles. He
affirms that GOD worked mighty deeds for their ancestors at the time of the
Exodus from Egypt, but GOD continues to perform awesome deeds for the people in
the present</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time. GOD is always making things new, moving the chosen
people to a further, deeper relationship with their GOD. The purpose of GOD
providing refreshing water for those who travel in the desert of their lives is
so that GOD will be given the glory and praise that is due as people experience
the life that flows from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes the need to give praise to GOD for all the
mighty deeds that have been done, and that continue to be done by the divine
hand of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although there are rough times, GOD will give the faithful
reasons to rejoice, just as harvesters rejoice in the rich produce of the land,
especially when the produce has been the result of other people’s hard work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As he writes to the community at Philippi, St. Paul reflects
on his own spiritual journey. Whereas he once was pleased at his own
self-righteousness and “proper” and “law-abiding” actions, he now realizes that
what he did is not as important as what GOD is doing and will continue to do
for and through him. In fact, his former actions are insignificant compared to
the fulness of life that is ahead for those who accept the gift of salvation
that Jesus has prepared through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the righteous religious leaders bring to
Jesus a woman caught in adultery. They hope to trap Jesus, to exalt their own
righteous ways, and to punish an evil</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doer. Jesus turns the cards on them by giving permission to
those who are without sin to be the first to throw stones at the sinful woman.
As the accusers start reflecting on their own lives, they realize that they are
not free from sin. Beginning with the eldest, and most likely the “wisest,”
they drop their stones and walk away in silence. Eventually, all who are left
are Jesus and the woman (and maybe some of Jesus’ disciples). When Jesus asks
the woman where her accusers are, she responds that none of them are present.
Jesus compassionately remarks that He will not condemn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>her either. He sends her on her way with the admonition to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“go and sin no more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I recall a talk I heard given
by Rev. Richard Rohr, O.F.M. He was speaking about the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>change that takes place in most individuals as they move
into the “second half” of life. My understanding of what Fr. Rohr said was that
in the first half of life, people focus on what their job is, what things they
do, and what they possess. Even GOoD and faithful young adults, like the rich
young man in Mark 10: 17-22, believe what is important is the keeping of the
commandments. Yet, in the second half (the time of wisdom, which some people
never attain), the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>focus shifts from “doing things” to “doing with less,” and
going where one does not necessarily want to go. It is a time of looking
further up ahead, to one’s transition from this earthly life to what lies
beyond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder more deeply on the “second half” of life, I have
been struck lately by what it means for me. I truly am, at least according to
my life expectancy, on the other side of my mid-point. I am also reminded, as
Fr. Rohr mentioned, of what Jesus said to Peter after the resurrection, “Amen,
amen, I say to you, when you were younger, you</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>used to dress yourself and go where you wanted; but when you
grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and
lead you where you do not want to go” (John 21: 18). This has come to mind
particularly as I saw how my father “transitioned” from his independence to
living a dependent life without the freedom he had just a few years before, to
his final transition to eternal life on the other side of earthly death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where is all of this leading, at least for me? That is the
right question, both for this reflection and for my faith journey. As I
continue my earthly pilgrimage, I need to move from the focus on possessions,
job descriptions, and doing the “right thing,” to looking ahead to where the
Lord is leading me. It is scary in one sense, because it is just the opposite
of what you and I have been told by the world should be our focus. We need to
let go, surrender, and trust that GOD is in control. It means that we should
not make ourselves righteous like the religious leaders who want to remove sin
by removing the sinners, except when they are forced to face the fact that they
are sinners also. It means we must take Jesus seriously when He says to us, as
He did to the woman, “I do not condemn you; go and sin no more.” It includes
realizing that we are being sent to others with the task of announcing the
forgiveness and mercy of GOD as demonstrated by Jesus’ ministry, life, death,
and resurrection. It is only when we can look beyond our interests and our
possessions and focus on where GOD is leading us that we can really be ready to
let go and let GOD take control of our lives. That means we have to change our
perspective and move on, as St. Paul remarks at the end of the Second Reading
today: “I continue my pursuit toward the goal, the prize of GOD’s upward
calling, in Christ Jesus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my focus in
life? Is it merely in what I do and what I have accomplished and what I
possess?  Do I take the time to look at what lies beyond this earthly
existence? What aspects of my life must I surrender to the Lord Jesus so that I
may fully follow where He is leading? How can I help others look beyond the
here and now and prepare themselves for the transition to the fullness of life
that GOD has in store for each of us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the beginning and the end of all
existence. Through Your GOoDness, You give us life on this earth. For most of
our lives, we focus on the existence we have here and now, as we accumulate
wealth, define ourselves by our work, and focus on our earthly life. Yet,
through the example and teachings of Your Son, Jesus, You remind us that there
is much more than life here and now. We find it hard to let go of what we have
and to trust that You will lead us to where You are. You continue to challenge
us to surrender ourselves into Your hands as Your Son, Jesus, did at the moment
of His death on the cross. We fight against such surrender because we have so
long been in control. Yet it is only in surrendering completely to You, that we
will experience the fullness of life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that You want for us. We pray that You will continue to give
us the courage, especially through the gifts of Your Holy Spirit. We lift up
this prayer as we lift up ourselves, all for Your greater glory and honor, in
and through Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who has given us an
example by His suffering and death, and given us hope by His resurrection, and
Who now is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of the Fifth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Optional Memorial of St. John Baptist de la Salle)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Baptist de la Salle:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Daniel 13: 1-9, 15-17, 19-30, 33-62;      Psalm
23: 1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6;       John 8: 1-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[The Lectionary provides two Gospel readings today: John 8:
1-11 and John 8: 12-20.  I have chosen to reflect on John 8: 1-11, even though
I did reflect on this yesterday on the Fifth Sunday of Lent - C Cycle.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings have a few similarities. In both the First
Reading and the Gospel, a woman is accused of adultery. In both cases, some of
the leaders seek to condemn and execute the woman who is accused. In both
cases, the accused woman is set free. The two readings differ in one very
important point. In the first case, the woman is wrongly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accused of the crime (sin). In the second cases, the accused
woman is guilty of the sin, but receives forgiveness and compassion from the
Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading is the story of Susanna. She is a Jewess
who is in exile in Babylon. Her husband is a respected man in the Jewish
community. Two evil Jewish judges lust after Susanna and plan to have their way
with her or, if they do not get their way with her, they plan to condemn her by
falsely bringing accusations against her. Susanna realizes she is trapped by their
wickedness, but she does not fall into sin, even though it means she will face
a death sentence if she refuses to give into the desires of the evil judges.
After being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accused, she publicly lifts up her plea in prayer to GOD.
GOD hears her prayer and sends Daniel to defend her and to set things right for
her and convict the sinful judges. This story is a powerful one, one that I
look forward to having proclaimed each year. I remember talking to a friend who
is a lector and who expressed her joy in being able to proclaim this reading in
church on this day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today is Psalm 23, the familiar one of the LORD
being our Shepherd Who protects us when we walk through the valley of darkness.
It is one with which Susanna was probably quite familiar, and she could have
prayed. It speaks of one’s ultimate trust in GOD, even in, or especially in,
one’s darkest hour of trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel of John 8: 1-11 presents the account of the
adulterous woman who is dragged before Jesus by the religious leaders who seek
to trap Jesus (and also carry out the punishment on the woman). They want to
not only condemn the woman, but also catch Jesus in either going against Jewish
law or seeking to have the woman stoned. Jesus not only challenges the leaders
to think about their own sinfulness, but also, He is willing to look beyond the
sin of the woman and care for the sinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realized how much power sin
has in our human lives and how much more powerful is the love and forgiveness
of GOD. In the reading from Daniel 13 we hear that the wicked judges let their
evil desires prevent them from being just: “They suppressed their consciences;
they would not allow their eyes to look to heaven, and did not keep in mind
just judgments.” It seems that they had used their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>position as judges of the law to have their way with people
who were accused. They were willing to give false judgments in order to have
their pleasures satisfied. One sin leads to another and another and another. .
.Yet, when they did not get their way, they were willing to not only falsely
accuse an honest and just woman, but also have her sentenced to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Susanna on the other hand would not give in to their evil.
She was willing to die rather than sin. She wanted to be faithful to GOD and the
precepts of GOD, even if it meant she had to suffer death. She prayed to GOD
for help and GOD responded by sending Daniel. Daniel, a just and holy man
himself, was able to see through the lies of the wicked and defend the
righteous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel of John 8: 1-11 presents the other woman accused
of adultery. Jesus does not condone her sin. He has compassion on her and
offers her forgiveness. He loves her while despising her sinful lifestyle. He
offers her a chance to change her life. At the same time, He challenges those
who are willing to condemn her. He reminds them that they are sinners too, and
they deserve the judgment of GOD. Jesus wants the accusers to realize that they
too have committed sins and have not been exposed to the full judgment that their
sins deserve. He, in a sense, offers them forgiveness and wants them to extend
the same forgiveness to the woman. Jesus is offering them faith – a closer
relationship with GOD – instead of their misunderstanding of religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does all of this say to me? It reminds me that I am a
sinner also. I have often let one sin lead to another. Yet, I have experienced
the forgiveness of GOD. I know how much GOD has forgiven me. I am often tempted
to (and have done it in the past) condemn people who do not follow what I
consider to be the righteous way. I have judged not only the sin but also the
sinner. I have even wrongly accused people of things they did not do, simply
because I assumed that they were guilty. (Remember when we “assume,” it makes
an “ass” out of “u” and “me.”)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have another thought that strikes me as I listen to the
readings and recall one of the sessions from the Religious Education Congress,
I once attended on the issue of capital punishment. I look at how Jesus acted
in dealing with the woman deserving of capital punishment according to the law
of His day. That reflection challenges my consciousness of whether we should
execute those who are accused of capital crimes. Are we being faithful to the
Gospel standards that Jesus presents in our position on capital punishment? It
seems that Jesus’ attitude is that of compassion, forgiveness, and doing what
is necessary to help a sinner reform their lives. I am not advocating total
release of those who may have committed serious crimes and have been convicted,
but a chance for them to repent, change their heart, and be a more productive
member of society (even if that is behind bars for the rest of their lives).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I once again come before the Lord Jesus and seek GOD’s
forgiveness. I realize that sin has been, and still is, a part of my life.
There are things I could do to enhance and deepen my relationship with GOD and
with others. And yet, I sometimes have sought my own selfish ways rather than
the way of being in relationship with GOD and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also humbled by the realization of GOD’s love for me.
GOD’s loving care is continually being showered upon me. As we hear in the
Responsorial, with the LORD being my Shepherd, I am given courage.  The LORD
spreads the table before me and anoints my head with oil, my cup overflows with
the GOoDness and kindness of my GOD.  I do </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not deserve all that GOD has given me, yet GOD wants me to
dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. How gracious is our GOD!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my reaction when
I encounter a person who “seems” to be a sinner? Am I quick to judge and assume
the worst of the person? Am I willing to love the sinner while not condoning
the sin? Do I seek to offer heart-felt compassion and the message of
forgiveness to the sinner? How aware am I of the mercy and love of GOD for me,
a sinner? By what means do I express my sin and seek GOD’s forgiving grace? How
can I be a better proclaimer of GOD’s pardon and peace?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and always forgiving.
Through Your GOoDness, You not only defend those who are wrongly accused, but
You also extend Your forgiveness to those who deserve to be punished for their
sins. You have sent Your Son to remind us of Your loving care. He and the Holy
Spirit have come not to condemn us, but to be our Advocate and to defend us,
and to give witness to our desire to be in relationship with You. Jesus is
willing to look beyond our wrongdoings to see the love You have for us. He asks
that we turn from our sinfulness and turn more fully to You. We thank You and
praise You for the GOoD News Jesus has brought to us through His teaching and
His ministry. We ask that You continue to pour out the gifts of Your Holy
Spirit upon us, so we can honestly and humbly admit our sinfulness and seek
Your forgiveness. We ask for the gift of strength to be able to live lives that
reflect Your grace and love. As always, we make this prayer through Jesus, Your
Son and our Brother,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of the Fifth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Julie Billiart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Numbers 21: 4-9;         Psalm 102:  2-3, 15-18, 19-21;                
John 8: 21-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How easy it is for us to be misguided in our relationship
with GOD!  The First Reading reminds us that the Israelites in the desert do
not realize how much GOD has done and continues to do for them.  The psalm is a
more fitting response to GOD:  GOD hears our cries and responds appropriately
if we humble ourselves.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks of His relationship with
His Abba-Father and the religious leaders misunderstand what He says.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tired from eating the food (manna) that GOD has supplied for
them, the Israelites grumble against GOD.  They long for the diversity of food
they had when they were slaves in Egypt.  Because of their misplaced anger,
they are susceptible to bites from “fiery” (saraph) serpents.  GOD has mercy on
the repentant people and heals those who look at the bronze serpent on a pole.
GOD is the source of healing, something which comes down to modern times in the
image of the serpent on the wooden pole which is similar to the symbol for
healing in medicine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a reminder that GOD hears the prayers of those
who put their faith in the LORD.  This implies a humble, contrite relationship
with GOD and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not speaking a discouraging word against GOD.  GOD shows
divine love to, and providential care for, those who honestly come into GOD’s
presence seeking help as they realize GOD’s concern for those who acknowledge
their need for the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the double meaning words common to the Gospel of St.
John, Jesus speaks about His approaching death.  As He speaks about going where
others cannot follow, the religious leaders take this as an illusion to
suicide.  Jesus, in dramatic contrast, is not going to kill Himself, but is
going to give up His life in obedience to His Abba’s will and for the sake of
all people.  He goes on to reveal His close relationship with the GOD Whom He
intimately calls His Abba-Father.  He is so united with GOD that He is able to
use a phrase that is linked to GOD’s proper name. Jesus uses the phrase which
in Greek is the Empharic expression, ἐγώ εἰμι – Ego eimi, (I AM).  This is
linked to the Hebrew proper name of GOD YHWH (sometimes translated as “I AM Who
AM”).  Jesus declares His oneness with the GOD of Scripture.  This association
is not missed by some of Jesus’ </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>listeners.  Some begin to believe in Him as the One Who is
joined to, and sent by, the GOD Who is Abba and YHWH.  Others are anxious to
condemn Him for His claim to be equal to the One and Only GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can read and re-read scripture and still fail to grasp
the message that GOD is sharing with us.  We can look at our lives and see only
the negative, and then blame GOD for what is not going right.  We fail to open
our eyes to experience the GOD Who is active in our lives.  We are not much
different than the Israelites traveling in the desert or the religious leaders
who are not willing to see GOD’s presence in Jesus.  Oh, we may say, “Jesus, I
believe in You!”; but we then try to force Jesus into our image of what we want
GOD to be. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me share with you an “all too real” example of this. 
Two Christian schools are playing each other in a sporting event.  Both pray to
GOD and try to convince GOD that GOD should be on their side and help them
“kill the other team” or “annihilate their opposition.”  Does GOD play
favorites? Is the result of the game GOD’s choice of who is GOD’s team? Does
GOD change the outcome of a game simply because one team “prays” better?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The real response for which GOD is looking from us is the
willingness to acknowledge Who GOD is and who we are.  We need to be honest,
and humbly admit that we need GOD’s help.  We need GOD’s help especially in
being able to accept what comes our way, knowing that GOD is with us even in
the midst of our problems, difficulties, pains, and sorrows.  The pandemic,
that we had for the some of the last years and the conflicts in Ukraine and the
Middle East that started a few years ago, have caused some people to question
GOD’s love, while others have used the time of the climatic changes and the
world strife to spend more time in prayer and deepen their relationship with
others, even if it has only been remotely.  When we can demonstrate our trust
in GOD and GOD’s plan for our lives, then we will be given a freedom and a
peace that is beyond understanding.  It does not necessarily mean that we will
be without discomfort or trying times, but we will know that we are loved and
cared for as we continue our journey to the Promised Land that GOD has said
will be ours if we remain united with the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words from the Book of Ezekiel keep coming back to me: 
“I have promised, and I will do it, says the LORD.”  That is the type of faith
we must have.  We believe that GOD will keep the divine promises.  The promises
may not be fulfilled in the way we intend or want or envision, but GOD will not
go back on the divine promises that GOD has made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus uses phrases throughout St. John’s Gospel that are the
promises in which we need to believe.  He says: “I AM the resurrection and the
life,”  “I AM the way, the truth, and the life”  “I AM the Good Shepherd.”  We
must believe that Jesus will give us life, truth, and protect us on the way. 
He has said it.  He is, and will be, Who He has said He is.  We do not have to
worry about when or how or where or why.  We need only hold firm to the Who.  Let
us join with the psalmist today and proclaim not only in word but by our way of
life:  “Let this be written for the generation to come, and let GOD’s future
creatures praise the LORD:  ‘The LORD looked down from GOD’s holy height, from
heaven the LORD beheld the earth, to hear the groaning of the prisoners, to
release those doomed to die.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I been
misguided in my relationship with GOD? What has caused me to misunderstand GOD
and what the Lord Jesus has promised? In what way can I delve more fully into
the relationship I have been offered by the Lord Jesus? How can I help others
realize that GOD is the One in Whom it is worth putting their faith because GOD
has promised, and GOD will do what has been promised?  Which promise of GOD
does someone I meet today need to hear and how can I reassure that person of
that promise?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving Abba-Father, before
Whom we come in prayer. Through Your GOoDness, You have promised to give us the
very best in this life and in the life to come. You have fulfilled Your
promises in and through Your Son, Jesus. He has come as the realization of all
that You have proclaimed and the completion of all that will be. We have
frequently tried to design our life around what we think You should be and what
we want You to do for us. In doing so, we have missed Who You are because we
have only thought about ourselves. For this we seek Your forgiveness and
pardon. Through the guidance of Your Holy Spirit, teach us to be humble and to
trust in You and Your promises. May we joyfully accept what You have given us
and look forward to even more blessings as we journey to be with You in Your
reign that has no end. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, the fulfillment of Your promises, the Way, the Truth, and the Life,
and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of the Fifth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Casilda:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 3: 14-20, 91-92, 95;        Daniel 3: 52,
53, 54, 55, 56;           John 8: 31-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who speak the Truth that comes from GOD, and those who
are in a close relationship with GOD, often find themselves in opposition to
those who are in authority over them, particularly if those in authority are
not open to the Truth and to GOD’s revelation.  The First Reading relates the
experience of three Hebrew young men who are willing to die rather than be
false to the Truth of Who GOD is.  The Responsorial is their hymn of praise of
GOD even during their time of persecution.  In the Gospel, Jesus challenges the
religious leaders of His day with the Truth of His relationship with His
Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading tells us part of the story of the three
young Jewish exiles:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  Prior to today’s passage,
we are told that they were trained in the royal service of the King of
Babylon.  They remain faithful Jews while rising in the service of the king. 
Some of the other royal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>court members were jealous of the three Jewish believers. 
Those who were jealous had convinced the king to make a royal decree in which
the king forced all citizens to worship a golden image the king had set up. 
Anyone who would refuse to worship the golden image would be executed.  In
today’s passage Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego tell the king that they cannot
and will not worship anyone or anything except the GOD of their Jewish faith. 
They are willing to be thrown into the fiery furnace, the means of execution. 
They make their prayer:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If our GOD, Whom we serve, can save us from the white- hot
furnace. . .may GOD save us!”  After being bound tightly and thrown into the
seven-fold hot furnace, they are seen walking freely among the burning flames,
untouched</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and perfectly safe.  The king comes to praise GOD Who has
protected them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The response is taken from the prayer of praise sung by the
three as they walk amidst the fiery furnace.  It gives glory and honor to the
GOD of their ancestors – the GOD Who is to be exalted above all forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, speaks about the faithful and true
disciple (disciplined learner) who knows the Truth that (Who) sets one free. 
The Truth comes from the relationship one has with GOD, in and through Jesus,
the Son of GOD (in union with the Holy Spirit).  If one is faithful to the
relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, one will be free of sin, and live as a descendant of
Abraham, our father in faith.  Nothing, not even persecution nor death, will be
able to enslave us if we are in relationship with GOD the Abba through Jesus,
the Son, in the unity of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus informs the religious leaders that they are not true
descendants of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham because they are not being true to the relationship
of faith that Abraham had with GOD.  They do not truly “know” the GOD upon Whom
they call.  If they were faithful to the relationship with GOD as Abba, they would
recognize Jesus as the One Whom GOD the Abba has sent.  Jesus speaks of sin as
not being in relationship with GOD:  “Everyone who lives in sin, is the slave
of sin.  (No slave has a permanent place in the family.)”  If one is aware of
one’s place in the family, one is not a slave – a slave of sin.  If one </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is still sinning, one has not come to the full awareness of
one’s relationship with the Abba Who is GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I think about my
relationship with GOD.  Am I a true and faithful disciple who seeks to deepen
my relationship with GOD in and through Jesus? I may say the right words, but
do I live</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my life in a way that shows I am in a loving relationship
with the Abba, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? Sometimes I am more like those
whom Jesus addresses in the Gospel – people who have not let the Word of Jesus
find a hearing among them.  As I reflect on my life, I realize that sin still
has an effect on my life.  I fail, at times, to see my relationship with GOD,
and therefore my relationship with others.  I seek my own selfish ways instead
of ways that praise the GOD Who is my Abba and the Abba of all people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I read a report a while ago that said, “Approximately 215
million Christians now experience high, very high,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or extreme levels of persecution; that means 1 in 12
Christians live where Christianity is ‘illegal, forbidden, or punishable. .
.’”  I may not be facing such oppressive persecution.  Would I be able to still
stand up for my faith if I were in a place where such persecution was being
done to Christians? That is a GOoD question for me (and you) to ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The example of the three young men in the First Reading
inspires me.  They were rising in status in their service of the king of
Babylon.  Because of the jealousy of others, they were forced to stand up for
their relationship with GOD.  They were willing to remain faithful to GOD as
their number one priority in life, even if that meant a painful, bodily death. 
They trusted in the loving relationship with GOD rather than in the power of
mortals.  If GOD would save them, then praised be GOD.  If GOD chose not to
save them, then praised be GOD anyway.  They would not change their allegiance
to GOD, because they had developed such a close relationship with GOD that they
knew that the relationship with GOD was something for which they would be
willing to die.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their song of praise of GOD as they walked in the white-hot
furnace should be our prayer, especially when we face opposition:  “Blessed are
You, O Lord, the GOD of our ancestors, praiseworthy and exalted above all
forever; and blessed is Your holy and glorious name, praiseworthy and exalted
above all for all ages.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What is the Truth
to which (to Whom) I am committed and for which (for Whom) I am willing to
die?  How do I see that Truth related to my relationship with GOD?  How can I
give witness to others about the Truth to which (to Whom) I am committed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever worthy of praise.  Through
Your GOoDness, You continue to invite us into a closer relationship with You. 
You promise to set us free from sin by the power of the Truth which/Who comes
from being members of Your family – Your children in and through Jesus, Your
Only Begotten Son.  Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>invites us to call You, Abba (Father-Daddy), and to share in
the relationship He has with You.  We sometimes fail to see the Truth and
instead we follow our own paths that lead to enslavement to sin and alienation
from You.  You continue to call us back to You.  We ask that You once again
pour upon us the gifts and harvest that come from Your Holy Spirit – knowledge,
wisdom, strength, joy, peace, and love (to name just a few) – so that we can
live as disciples of Your Son.  We ask that we may always focus on our
relationship with You, Your Son,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the Holy Spirit, so we are willing to boldly live out
that relationship, even in the face of opposition.  May we sing Your praise and
give You glory and honor, for You are praiseworthy and should be exalted above
all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forever – You Who are one with Your Son and the Holy Spirit,
the GOD of our ancestors – the GOD Whose name is holy and glorious, above all
for all ages.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of the Fifth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Magadalen of Canossa: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-magdalene-of-canossa/
Readings: Genesis 17: 3-9;          Psalm 105: 4-5, 6-7, 8-9;          John 8:
51-59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being in relationships seems to be the focus of our
scripture passages today, at</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>least for me.  GOD calls Abram into a relationship with the
GOD Who Is.  The Responsorial calls us to remember that we have been invited
into a relationship with the GOD Who Is.  In the Gospel, Jesus affirms that He
Is one with GOD and wants us to be united with Himself and with GOD Whom He
calls Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage from Genesis, GOD establishes a covenant with
Abram and changes his name to Abraham.  [The New American Bible: [17:5] Abram
and Abraham are merely two forms of the same name, both meaning, “the father is
exalted”; another variant form is Abiram (Nm 16:1; 1 Kgs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:34). The additional -ha- in the form Abraham is explained
by popular etymology as coming from ab-hamon</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>goyim, “father of a multitude of nations.” Link:
http://www.usccb.org/bible/genesis/17:3] This covenant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship binds GOD to Abraham and his descendants.  GOD
will be Abraham’s GOD and will take care of Abraham. Abraham and his
descendants are asked to remain faithful to the covenant relationship that GOD
is beginning with Abraham.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a call for the offspring of Abraham to remember
the relationship of the covenant into which GOD entered with the patriarch.  It
is also a prayer to GOD, reflecting upon the promises GOD made in establishing
the covenant relationship.  GOD and the people are united through this bond,
that is a holy, lasting bond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus speaks of Abraham and the relationship
Jesus has with Abraham.  This causes the religious leaders to become angry. 
According to them, Jesus is saying that He is better than the patriarch Abraham
who first began the close relationship with YHWH – the LORD GOD.  Jesus affirms
that He is greater</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>than Abraham because He is in a longer, closer relationship
with YHWH – the LORD GOD – than Abraham had.  Jesus uses the Greek phrase Ego
eimi (åãï åéìé) – “I AM” the same phrase that is used to translate the proper
name for GOD in Hebrew, YHWH, thus showing that He is one with the GOD of Abraham
and of Moses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflection today leads me to keep thinking about the
concept of relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To me, that is the essence of what it means to be a believer
– a Christian, since that is the essence of Who GOD Is.  GOD is relationship. 
In the GODhead, there is the relationship of Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit.  That
relationship is called love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(aGApe). That relationship is so powerful, GOD wants to
extend beyond the GODhead in a creative way – thus the world was created.  GOD
from the beginning (Genesis) wanted to share that relationship with others,
thus humans were created in the image and likeness of GOD.  Man and woman were
created with the desire to be in relationship – with GOD and with each other. 
Although humans have not always been true to the relationship that GOD desired
them to have, GOD has given us more chances – establishing new covenants –
relationships – with us:  with the fallen couple a promise of future
relationship; with Noah in the covenant relationship after the flood; with
Abraham as we hear in our First Reading; with Moses as GOD revealed Who GOD Is
– YHWH.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The rest of the Hebrew scriptures are GOD’s call to the
chosen people to remember the relationship that GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>established with them.  It speaks of how the people are
unfaithful in living out the relationship and how GOD keeps sending them
spokespersons (prophets) to remind them that they were called to be in
relationship with a GOD Who is relational.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, GOD the Son, the One Who always has been in
relationship with His Abba, has come to further reveal the relationship that is
offered to all who believe in the divine relationship.  It is because Jesus
professes this close relationship with His Abba (Who is GOD) that He is
persecuted. If people would fully accept the relationship with GOD as Jesus
presents it, then the established religious human structures of the Jewish
religion (and all religions) would have no meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does that say to me?  It says a lot about how I am
called to live my life.  I am not called to do GOoD (perform actions), I am
called to be – be in relationship with GOD.  Religion should not be just a set
of rules and regulations that must be followed.  Religion is called to be a
support in developing a closer relationship with a GOD Who Is – a GOD Who relates. 
If the structures of religion become the center point instead of the
relationship, then we are deprived of what GOD wants – for us to be one with
the GOD Who Is.  GOD’s name in Hebrew implies relationship.  GOD is not the One
Who Does.  GOD is YHWH – the GOD Who IS.  We are called into that BEING, not
into doing.  Our actions should flow from </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who we are – people in relationship with the GOD Who Is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of a phrase I was taught as a child.  GOD is
the Supreme Being.  I did not fully grasp what that meant when I was a child. 
Yet, as I reflect on that title for GOD, I realize that GOD is not called the
Supreme Doing or the Supreme Do-er, although GOD is that.  GOD is the Supreme
Being.  GOD is the One Who has been, is, and always will be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have had experiences in the last few years that have
challenged me in being in relationship with others, more particularly with
particular individuals.  It was twenty-two years ago that my earthly father
died.  In the last seventeen months of his earthly life, I spent a lot of time
just being with my father in a facility that cares for people with dementia and
Alzheimer’s.  I had to be very patient, caring, and understanding with not only
my Dad, but also with other residents of the facility.  In his last few days,
as my Dad was drawing to the close of his earthly sojourn, I was called to just
be – be there for him.  There was nothing I could do.  Yet as the family
continued to surround him, touch him, talk to him, we were there for him – we
were in relationship with him.  We are also there for each other – we were in
relationship with one another.  I had to be very careful about what I said and
what I did, always thinking of others’ mental, physical, and emotional health
concerns, being with them and making them know that I am totally intent on
being there for them.  I had to sometimes just</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>BE there, when I would have rather been DOING a chore and
moving onto something else.  I was called to not only be a do- er for these
individuals, but just be in relationship with each person I encountered – a
much harder ministry and calling.  I have also spent time over the past few
years in being with some of my high school classmates who are in institutions
for those suffering from dementia or Alzheimers, or recovering from stokes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more we take the time to BE in GOD’s presence, the more
we will be able to live as people who relate – who relate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to GOD and who relate to all those who are loved by GOD
(that includes everyone). I have been blessed over the last few years in
spending more and more time reflecting on my relationship with GOD.  I am
conscious of it as I spend the time writing reflections.  I used to think if I
spent 15 minutes a day in prayer, that was great.  Now I spend an hour or more
each day in reflecting on my relationship with GOD and putting it in words.  It
has changed my life – I am energized, I am more aware of my relationship with
others, because I realize that is part of my relating to the GOD Who Is.  I
have more insights into the Word of GOD because I try to relate to the GOD Who
Is, Who Is revealed in the divine Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can never go back to just doing – just reciting rote
prayers or performing certain rites – without spending time in being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– being in relationship with the GOD Who Is.  The more time
I spend in being in relationship, the more time I want to relate to GOD and to
those whom GOD has placed in my life, so that I can relate to them and share
with them the GOD with Whom I have come to be present, through my
ever-deepening relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What is the focus
of my life – doing things or being in relationship? How much time do I spend
just being with GOD? How much time do I spend in the human-to-human
relationships that GOD has allowed me to have?  How does my action change when
I focus on relationships rather than doing things? What difference will this
time of reflection make in my encounters today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever relational, You Who are the
One Who Is.  Through Your GOoDness and Being, You, in Your essence, relate
within Yourself as Abba-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  Your relating is what we
label “Love.”  Your relating is so awesome that it is creative – it gives
life.  You invite us – beg us – to be a part of that creative relationship. You
keep on speaking Your words of unity and oneness.  You want us to experience
the fullness of Who You Are.  Yet, we, in our individual lives and our lives as
members of Your Holy people, have failed to fully understand Who You Are.  We
focus on “doing” rather than “being.” We seek to prove our position by our
actions rather than experience our relationship with You by being – being one
with You, being Your daughters and sons. Through Your Son, You have given us a
fuller glimpse into Who You Are.  Jesus speaks of His relationship with You,
for He is truly one with You.  He once again invites us to come and be – be one
with Him and with You.  We praise You and thank You for Who You Are.  We are
blessed by being in relationship with You.  Give us the wisdom and
understanding, and the courage, to take the time to be – to be still – to be in
relationship with You.  We ask for forgiveness for the times</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we have chosen to do things instead of just being with You. 
We seek healing of our relationship with You and with others, for we have not
always placed relationships in the proper perspective.  To You we lift up this
prayer, for You are our one and only GOD, Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit, the
essence of Being, the One Who Is, past, present, and for ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Stanislaus)  Saint Stanislaus:  Readings:
Jeremiah 20: 10-13;      Psalm 18: 2-3a, 3bc-4; 5-6, 7;     John 10: 31-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again on a Friday during the Lenten season, we are
reminded that those who are not open to GOD’s Word are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the ones who are actively seeking to eliminate those who are
speaking the Word of GOD. Jeremiah senses the tension increasing between
himself and those whom he is challenging to hear GOD’s Word. The psalm echoes
Jeremiah’s ultimate trust in the GOD Who has called him to speak the Word, and
on Whom Jeremiah calls, and in Whom he trusts. In the Gospel, Jesus confronts
those who are opposed to Him and His proclamation of the Word of GOD and His
doing GOD’s work and living out His position as the Son of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, Jeremiah can sense the opposition
against him and against his proclaiming of the Word of the LORD. Even those who
were once considered his friends are turning against him. He cries out to GOD
for help. The parallel to Jesus can be seen in this passage from Jeremiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm expresses the fact that GOD hears the prayer of
those who cry out to GOD. GOD is the strength for those who are in relationship
with the LORD. GOD is the rock of refuge, the shield, the horn of salvation. In
the worst of situations, GOD will be of assistance to those who trust in divine
protection, especially to those who are living according to GOD’s Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel begins with the picking up of stones by the
people who are opposed to Jesus. They are ready to stone Him at this very
moment. He asks them for which of the signs He has done do they want to stone
Him. It is not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for the miracles He has done, but because He speaks about
His relationship with GOD – making Himself equal to GOD. He uses Hebrew
Scripture (the Old</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Testament – [This is a reference to the judges of Israel
who, since they exercised the divine prerogative to judge (Dt 1:17), were
called “gods”; cf. Ex 21:6, besides Ps</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>82:6 from which the quotation comes.]) – to show that those
in relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD, share in GOD’s life and are considered to have
divine life within them. Jesus continues to once again speak about the union He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has with GOD the Father, His Abba. Jesus and His Abba are
one with each other. This leads some in the crowd to want to put Jesus to death
even more, but since it is not yet the Hour (the correct time)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for Jesus to be glorified (through His death and
resurrection), Jesus leaves Jerusalem and heads down east to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jordan River and the area across the Jordan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings are leading us into Holy Week. We are being
prepared for Jesus’ Hour of Glory – His suffering and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His death – and His resurrection. The scene is set for His
betrayal and denial by close friends, His being handed over</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the opposition, His persecution at the hands of those who
will not accept His GOoD News message, a message of an invitation to be in a
truly closer relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I contemplate the readings, I am moved to a feeling of
awe. Jesus does not turn from His desire to proclaim a close relationship with
GOD. He wants people to understand how much GOD loves them and desires to be a
part of their lives. Yet He meets opposition, because if GOD becomes so much a
part of people’s lives, as Jesus announces, then they must give up their habits
and the practices that do not fit with having a close relationship with a
loving GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think of the people in the Middle East today. If they
would listen to the words of the One True GOD Whom they say they worship, they
would have to see that they are called into a closer relationship with others
who worship the same GOD, and also with everyone, since all are children of
GOD. Yet, they do not want to give up their customs and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>long held opposition to their enemies, whom they fail to see
as fellow children of the one GOD. Having a belief in, and relationship with, a
GOD Who is the Abba-Father of all, would force them to be understanding and
caring to GOD’s other children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes I think most Christians are not taking seriously
their relationship with GOD as proclaimed by the Son of GOD. And then I realize
that I do not always take seriously the GOoD News of Jesus either. I sometimes
try to make GOD’s Word fit my understanding, to rationalize my opinions and
actions rather than make me and my thoughts be in line with the Gospel — the
GOoD News of Jesus. It is so easy to use scripture to back my view of life, but
it is so much harder to make my view of life reflect the Truth in scripture. I
do not always live according to the message of Jesus Christ, instead I try to
make Jesus’s words fit my lifestyle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I listen to Jesus’ message that He and His Abba are one,
and that GOD desires that I be one with Jesus and His Abba, in the unity of the
Holy Spirit, and with all who are called to be in relationship with GOD, then I
would have to live my life with a different focus. My focus would be on
building a loving relationship with GOD and with all GOD’s children, that is,
everyone. I would want people to experience the divine relationship about which
Jesus speaks. I would be willing to risk my life in order to live out that
relationship with GOD and GOD’s holy people (that should include everyone).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Living according to the GOoD News of Jesus will lead to
opposition. There will be opposition from people who do not want to hear the
Gospel because they know it will cause them to change their lifestyles, the
very lifestyle to which they have become accustomed, and to which they wrongly
think is what their vision of GOD is calling them to practice. Those are the
ones who prefer to live in the darkness that hides their wicked ways rather
than come into the Light of Jesus’ teaching. It could come from friends and
family members who think their loved ones are fanatical in their living out the
Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The closer we come in our relationship with GOD, the more
the enemy will be working against us. We will then need to cry out to GOD as did
Jeremiah, the psalmist, and particularly Jesus. We will need to be strengthened
by the GOD Who is our rock of refuge, our shield, our stronghold. And in our
distress, we will call upon the Lord Jesus, and He and His Abba will hear our
voice. GOD may not remove the opposition we face, but GOD will give us the
strength to face the opposition as Jesus did. And then like Jeremiah, the
psalmist, and Jesus, we will be able to praise the GOD Who loves us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How has my relationship
with GOD grown during the past few weeks (during Lent)? Am I more committed to
being a disciple and an apostle of the Master-Teacher by sharing the Word of
GOD with those whom I encounter, even though I might face opposition?  Do I
continue to turn to the GOD Who is the rock of refuge and stronghold as I give
witness to GOD Who desires to be in relationship with all people? How am I
reaching out to the other children of GOD and reminding them of GOD’s love for
them, particularly as we all deal with the sicknesses, global weather issues,
and the worldly tensions, and their effects?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and caring. Through
Your GOoDness, You proclaim Your desire to be in relationship with us through
the life and teachings of Your Son, Jesus. It was in the very proclamation of
His relationship with You that He faced the most opposition. Hatred and death
threats came from people who would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have to change their lives if they believed in Jesus’ words.
Jesus remained focused on His desire to do Your will and to give glory to You
through His life and ministry, His suffering and death, and His resurrection.
This would be His hour of glory – the hour in which He would give You glory.
Give us the strength to commit ourselves to proclaiming Your GOoD News. May we
live lives that proclaim Your love and care for every individual. May we have
the courage to stand up to the opposition we will face as we live according to
Gospel values. And may You and Your Son and Spirit receive all the glory,
praise, and honor as we give witness to Your loving relationship with Your holy
people. We pray this in and through Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and
Master-Teacher, Who willingly laid down His life as a sign of Your love, and
Who is now living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of the Fifth Week of Lent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Teresa of los Andes:  https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-teresa-of-los-andes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Ezekiel 37: 21-28;         Jeremiah 31: 10,
11-12abcd, 13;            John 11: 45-56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, so many thoughts run
through my mind. One common thread that goes through the readings is GOD’s
gathering together of the holy people from the dispersed regions of the world
and renewing the covenant relationship with them. GOD wants all the peoples
(whom the Lord Jesus has made holy) to be in relationship with GOD and with
each other. This is only possible through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading comes from the prophet Ezekiel. Ezekiel is
speaking to the exiles during their captivity. It is GOD’s call to all the
exiled people, not just during the exile in Babylon, but from all previous and
future exiles, to come back to GOD and be united. GOD wants to renew the divine
relationship (covenant) with the dispersed chosen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people. The former northern tribes of Israel and the
southern tribes of Judah will be re-united under the One Who is the offspring
of David. GOD will restore the fortunes of the great kingdom that had existed
under David and his son, Solomon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial continues this same theme in calling all
those who are distant to come back and be one under the LORD GOD Who will
shepherd them. The sorrow that GOD’s people have experienced will be turned to
joy as they re- establish their covenant relationship with their GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel reading (that follows the raising of Lazarus),
the religious leaders come together to discuss how Jesus and His teaching might
affect the Jewish nation. They are afraid that Jesus will lead the people in
such a way that the Romans will come and destroy Jerusalem and disperse the
Jewish people throughout the Roman Empire. They believe it would be better to
sacrifice Jesus in order to save the nation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. John comments that their words reveal part of the truth,
but they miss</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the main truth of the message. Jesus will be sacrificed for
the people, not only the Jewish people but for all people. His death will bring
together all who truly call on GOD as Abba-Father. All the true children of GOD
will be reconciled with GOD through the death (and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>resurrection) of Jesus. What the religious leaders hoped
would not happen (the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jewish
nation) will only be postponed for some 40 years. Around 70 A.D., the Romans
will come and disassemble the Jewish nation and its people. Yet, the new chosen
people will be brought into a new covenant, a new testament, a new relationship
with GOD, their Abba, through the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All these readings make us aware of how GOD is preparing the
scene for the events of next week – Holy Week. We are being led into the climax
of the year when we celebrate with sorrow – and joy – the saving events of
Jesus’ passion, death – and resurrection. We can sense the tension building
between the religious leaders and Jesus. The purpose of Jesus’ life and
teachings is becoming more clear: in order to bring GOD’s holy people into a
closer relationship with GOD, Jesus must make the ultimate sacrifice of dying –
dying on a cross. His death and resurrection will bring salvation, holiness,
and renewed relationship to all people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am becoming more and more drawn into the meaning of Jesus’
death and resurrection. I also recall a reflection talk I gave a few years ago
on the Easter Triduum (the Paschal Mystery celebrated on the “three days” of
Holy Thursday, GOoD Friday, and Holy Saturday [Easter Vigil]). The key events
of Jesus’ life are being retold, re-enacted, re-lived this coming week. We are
a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people who practice remembering (zikaron in Hebrew,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anamnesis in Greek). This remembering – by re-enacting –
makes the events come alive for us. We will become part of the crowd welcoming
Jesus into Jerusalem tomorrow on Passion (Palm) Sunday. We will be there as the
religious leaders plot</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>against Jesus. We will sit down at table with Jesus as He
breaks bread and shares His Body and Blood with us at the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last Supper. We will walk with Him into the garden of
Gethsemane and be there as they arrest Him. We will watch as they falsely
accuse Him and lead Him off to the Roman governor (Pilate) and to Herod (in
Luke’s Gospel). Our voice will join with those who yell, “Crucify Him, Crucify
Him!” for it is our sins that scream for His death. We will be in the crowd as
Jesus is led through the streets of Jerusalem to the hill of the Skull
(Golgotha [Hebrew] or Calvary [English version of Latin]). We will stand with Mary
and John as the soldiers nail Him to the cross and raise it high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will hear His dying words and see Him hand over His
spirit to His Abba in an act of love. We will be there as they take Him down
from the cross, lay Him in His mother’s arms, and then carry Him off and place
Him in the tomb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, that is not where our journey will end. For we will be
there three days later as Jesus’ followers will come to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>empty tomb and later when they meet the Risen Lord. We will
hear the words spoken to us: “Shalom – Peace.” This will not be some role
playing of past history. It is what is happening right here and right now for
us. We are part of the paschal mystery. We are being brought into the
relationship with GOD through being a part of Jesus’ life, death, and
resurrection. This relationship is ours today because we remember, we
celebrate, we believe. Our salvation is now. We are being united with our GOD
presently. Jesus is making GOD’s people holy right now. We are asked to further
unite ourselves with GOD our Abba, the Lord Jesus, and all of GOD’s holy
people, all in the unity of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not something that happened 2000 years ago. It is a
present reality, right now. We are presently part of the salvation by our GOD.
All the people of GOD throughout the world are being called into the
relationship with our GOD Who is Abba, Who is our Shepherd Who sacrifices for
us, Who is the Spirit Who unites us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will continue to pray this coming Holy Week for a real
renewal of all of GOD’s holy people, that we will practice zikaron, anamnesis,
remembering and making present, the saving acts of our Lord Jesus. We can do
this in our homes as we read, break open, and reflect on the scripture
readings, as well as when we gather in church. May our participation in this
year’s Holy Week scripture readings and our reflections on these events make
our relationship with GOD more real and alive. And may it unite us with all
GOD’s holy people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I have a sense
of being drawn into a deeper relationship with GOD as I remember, celebrate,
and believe the key events in the history of salvation? How will I be a more
active participant this year in the zikaron (remembering, re- enacting,
re-living) events of Holy Week? How can I share the importance of these events
with others so that they will also be drawn closer to the Lord of salvation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all knowing Divine Being and
Spanner of all time. Through Your GOoDness, You continue to draw us into a
closer relationship with You and Your Son by allowing us to be present at the
saving events of history. You invite us to remember, to celebrate, to believe
in what Jesus’ suffering, death, and resurrection means for us today. [I use a
singular verb (“means”) because Jesus’ suffering, death, and resurrection are
actually the one saving event known as the paschal mystery.]  You ask us to
fully reflect on the events of Holy Week by reading the liturgical</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>scriptures, so we can experience Your love as manifested in
Jesus’ acts of total giving of Himself – for our salvation. You make us holy
today by our remembering, our celebrating, our believing what Jesus did – the
restoration of a new covenant, a new testament, a new relationship with You.
Give us the wisdom to take the time to reflect on the saving moment of our
lives. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, renew within us the fire of Your
love, so we can fully understand what Jesus’ suffering, death, and resurrection
means for us. And may we give glory, honor, and praise to You, Your Son
(Jesus), and the Holy Spirit, not just on Passion (Palm) Sunday and the other
days of Holy Week, but each and every day of our lives. We make this prayer
through Jesus, the Christ, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior, Who suffered,
died, and rose again, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of Holy Week</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Peter Gonzalez: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-peter-gonzalez</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 42: 1-7;       Psalm 27: 1, 2, 3,
13-14;         John 12: 1-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On this Monday of Holy Week, we continue our journey with
Jesus during His last days before His Hour of Glory: His death – and His
resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Readings most of this week come from Isaiah’s
passages about the Suffering Servant. Our First Reading today is the first of
the Suffering Servant Songs in Isaiah. In today’s excerpt, we hear how GOD is
pleased with the Servant who will minister in a quiet, but powerful, way. This
Servant of GOD will tend to those who are bruised and broken, and He will
establish justice. This Servant will bring about a new covenant relationship,
opening the eyes of the blind, and setting free those who are oppressed and
living in darkness. All this because this Person has a servant heart – One Who
seeks to be of service to those in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today focuses on trust in GOD. Even in the most
difficult situations, there is no need for fear if one waits for the LORD with
courage. GOD will bring light and salvation to those who trust in the LORD.
This speaks both about Jesus’ trust in His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father as He faces His impending passion, and our trust
in GOD as we face difficult times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Gospel takes place just days before Passover (both the
Jewish celebration of Passover and Jesus’ own Passover, through His death into
the Glory of His Resurrection). Jesus returns to Bethany, the home of Lazarus,
Martha, and Mary. The religious leaders are ever vigilant concerning Jesus’
movements. Other elements that point us to the events later this week become
apparent. Martha takes the servant role in providing the meal (just as Jesus
will be a servant during His Last Supper). Mary lavishly anoints Jesus’ feet in
a sign of love and service, as Jesus will wash the feet of His followers. Judas
reveals his concern not for people, but for money as he comments that the value
of the oil used for the anointing of Jesus should have been given to the common
purse to be used for the poor – the common purse that Judas managed and used
for the poor – “poor” Judas. Jesus speaks about the anointing as a preparation
for His own burial (that will take place in just days). We also hear of the
religious leaders’ continuing plot to kill Jesus, and not only Jesus, but
Lazarus as well, since people are “turning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>away” from established religious leaders and believing in
Jesus because of Jesus’ raising of Lazarus. Thus, they show their fear that
Jesus is taking people away from their own sphere of influence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on just one aspect of the readings, I can sense
the momentum building as we draw closer to Jesus’ last days before His
suffering and death. The aspect that strikes me the most is that of
Servanthood. Jesus comes in fulfillment of Isaiah’s passages about the
Suffering Servant. He will demonstrate His Servanthood even more in the days to
come as He serves His disciples at the Last Supper as a sign of His willingness
to give His life. He will continue His Servant mentality throughout His
passion. Being a servant is a matter of the mind. It is one’s attitude towards
others. I was reading a book a while ago. The book described the attitude of a
servant-leader. It spoke of true leaders as persons who do not think less of
themselves, but who think of themselves less often. They don’t put themselves
down or belittle themselves, but they think of others more than they think of
themselves. This is Jesus’ attitude. He has come to proclaim the GOoD News of
His Abba-Father’s love. He ministers and serves others. He will give Himself
totally to others and for others. His focus is never on Himself, but on what He
can do to live out the divine will and bring others into a closer relationship
with GOD, His Abba. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary and Martha, in their own way, demonstrate the servant
attitude.  In contrast, Judas thinks only of himself and what will “benefit”
himself.  He is not thinking of service to the poor, but rather how he can be
served.  In a similar way, the attitude of some of the religious leaders is not
one of servanthood. Instead, they see Jesus as a threat Who must be eliminated
because He is taking people away from their power and their being served by the
people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded of this need to have a servant mentality as I
watched the people who cared for my father during his last hours on earth, over
twenty years ago.  They were willing to do anything to make his final earthly
existence as comfortable as possible.  They had moved all of his belongings and
furniture from the small, shared room where he had been in for a year and
half.  They provided a larger room with no roommate.  When Dad arrived from the
hospital, they lovingly washed and cleaned him, shaved and cared for him in a
way that hospital staff had not done.  They also made our whole family as
comfortable as possible, bringing in food and drink and extra chairs.  Although
Silverado is not officially religiously affiliated, the staff members were
deeply faith-filled.  They prayed with Dad and with us, both in Spanish and
English. They made us feel that our bringing Dad back to Silverado was not a
burden and extra work for them, but a blessing to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them.  They did much more than what was expected of them and
more than they were paid to do.  They made the decision to love and serve, not
because their paycheck demanded it, but because they wanted to give love.  Even
though they, too, were grieving Dad’s transitioning out of their presence, they
focused on serving Dad and his family, rather than focusing on their own
feelings of loss.  They realized that their service of Dad and us, his family,
was how they demonstrated the love they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>had for Dad and the love they had for GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The attitude of servanthood should be our attitude –
thinking of ourselves less and thinking of how we can bring the GOoD News of
Jesus to others by our caring actions.  We should work on helping others deepen
their relationship with the GOD Who loves them.  We have to have the attitude
of servants, people who choose to be of service to others, trusting that GOD
will be with us as our light and our salvation (Responsorial). We will be able
to do so if we reflect on how our Lord Jesus came in service and was the
Suffering Servant for us (First Reading).  The more we are touched by the
example of the Suffering Servant Jesus, the more we will be able to serve
others.  Thus, we need to focus on our relationship with the Suffering
Servant.  He has given us the example to follow: No greater love does anyone
have than one is willing to lay</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>down one’s life for another (John 15: 13).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Especially during the pandemic crisis during the past years
and the conflicts in Ukraine and other places, and political unrest in our
countries over the last few years, and climatic problems of recent times, we
have seen examples of front-line workers caring for others, even risking
catching the virus or being murdered by the Russian forces, or injured as they
helped people during hurricanes and other weather-related destructions.  We,
too, can go out of our way to do the little extra.  We may be able to be of
service by corresponding with others via phone, emails, and social media.  We
might also run errands for those who cannot go out and get needed items.  We
can pray for all those affected by the illnesses, the Ukrainian conflict, and
other trying experiences, whether it is lack of paycheck, inconvenience of
being “home-bound,” or suffering physically and emotionally from the stresses
in their lives, or their having to leave their homeland.  We have seen examples
of this type of servant mentality in the news, and we should do what we can to
serve others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How well do I
manifest a servant’s attitude when it comes to the other people in my life? Am
I number 1 when it comes to priority in my life, or is my service to others
more important?  How might I better serve the people in my family this week?
the people with whom I associate in my community or in my workplace? What one
act of service can I perform this week to show that I desire to follow the
example of Jesus’ Servanthood?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, almighty and ever loving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son to us as the Servant-Leader. He
came so that we might know Your love for us.  He lived a life of service,
choosing to think of Himself less often and others more often.  He willingly
followed Your plan, even to death, death on the cross.  He gave His life so
that we might live.  As we contemplate His saving Servanthood, especially this
Holy Week, we ask that You send Your Holy Spirit upon us, so we can follow in
Jesus’ footsteps in giving loving service to others.  Help us to be humble
servants, not thinking less of ourselves, but thinking of ourselves less often,
and thinking of others more.  May we joyfully give to others even when it is
painful, just as our Master-Teacher did.  In this way we will be able to deepen
our relationship with Jesus, with You, and with Your Holy Spirit.  And may we
continue to give You all praise, glory, and honor.  We pray this in the name of
Your Suffering Servant, Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and Savior, Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of Holy Week</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Caesar de Bus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 49: 1-6;       Psalm 71: 1-2, 3-4a,
5ab-6ab, 15 and 17;        John 13: 21-33, 36-28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings draw us ever closer into the paschal mystery of
Jesus’ suffering and death (and future resurrection) – His Hour of Glory, as
St. John calls it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading is another one of the Suffering Servant
passages from Isaiah. It reminds us that the Suffering Servant has been called
by GOD from before birth to fulfill the ministry of bringing the Chosen People
into a closer relationship with GOD. The passage has the Suffering Servant
expressing that at times the mission seems to have been in vain, with the
Servant spending all the strength without any apparent success in bringing the
People closer to GOD; yet in the end, the Servant is glorified by GOD and
becomes not only the means of saving the Chosen People, but also the light to
all nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on this reading, I think of how much this
applies to Jesus. Beginning with His earthly birth, His life’s purpose has been
to draw people to GOD. It must seem at times like Jesus is spending His energy
without much success. His work might seem like it is in vain at times,
especially as He nears the end of His life. Yet, Jesus realizes that even the
most tragic events of His suffering and death would be the source of
glorification of His Abba-Father and the means by which people will be saved
and brought into the Light of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up on the close relationship that exists
between the One called by GOD from His birth. It also speaks about the ultimate
trust in GOD that marks the Chosen One of GOD. This psalm reaches its
fulfillment in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus. He has the perfect relationship with GOD, since He
and His Abba-Father are one. Even in His darkest hour, He trusts in GOD, His
Abba. He sees His passion as the Hour of Glory of both His Abba and Himself, in
union with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is from St. John’s account of the Last Supper.
Jesus is gathered with His apostles. As He looks out at those whom He has
called to the special relationship as apostles and His closest disciples, He is
moved with the greatest emotions. He realizes that He is about to be betrayed
by one of His chosen ones. He dismisses Judas to do what he is going to do, and
to do it quickly. Judas, the keeper of the common purse, goes out to increase
his own purse by his betrayal of his Master. It is interesting that once Judas
leaves, it is night. Darkness has come upon the world. A new Jewish day begins
at dusk – the day when the ultimate darkness will seem to have won a victory
over the Light, but a day when the Light will win the final victory – the day
when the Lamb of GOD will be slaughtered as a sacrifice for the world – a day
when GOD will be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>glorified by the spilling of the Lamb’s blood – the day of
salvation for all people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this passage we also hear bold Peter proclaim that he is
willing to die for Jesus. Jesus asserts that before the dawn breaks and the
rooster crows, Peter will deny His Master and Lord – three times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me about today’s readings is Jesus’ choice.
Jesus consciously chooses what He does and whom He wants to be His chosen
disciples. He has chosen individuals to be a part of His inner circle – people
with whom He has shared an even closer relationship. Yet in this inner band of
twelve, one will betray Him, and the one who is called to be the leader will
deny his relationship with Jesus. Nine of the other ten will scattered and
hide. Only one will be brave enough to stand beneath the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am in awe as I reflect on this. Jesus could have chosen
individuals who would be totally true to Him. Yet, in choosing individuals whom
He knew would fall short of the expectations of the close relationship that He
is offering them, Jesus holds up for us the realization that not one of us is
perfect; that all of us – no matter how blessed we have been in our
relationship with the Lord Jesus – all of us fall short in our limited
humanity. It is only the saving acts of Jesus that can restore us to the close
relationship with Jesus and His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I guess that this is particularly important for us as we
hear about individuals who had been called to be servant- leaders in the Church
and society, but who had fallen into sinfulness. We may be shocked that a man
of the cloth, especially one who was an “overseer” or episcopus (bishop) could
do such things as have been reported over the past decades. We say, “they
should not have done such things, after all they were gifted individuals whom
we admired.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet if those individuals whom Jesus chose during His earthly
life were not perfect and could betray and deny Him, then it is also possible
that other individuals whom GOD called to lives of service and public
importance could fall into sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not saying this to condone what has happened. It was
wrong, just as it was wrong for Peter to deny his relationship with his Master
three times on the very night on which he said he would die for, and with, his
Master. Sin is wrong, but Jesus’ forgiveness and His offer of salvation are
more powerful than sin. The Light of Jesus is more powerful than darkness.
Thank GOD for that. All of us have fallen into sin. All of us, in one way or
another, have betrayed or denied the relationship we have been called to have
with our Master and with His Abba (in union with the Holy Spirit). All of us,
chosen and gifted as we are, have not always stood up for our Lord and Master,
especially when it has come to key moments when we could and should have
demonstrated our relationship with Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The actions of Judas and Peter and the arrest of Jesus tore
the community of His followers apart. They were like sheep scattered after the
death of the Shepherd. Yet the full message of this Holy Week is that Jesus’
suffering and death brought salvation to all who would look upon the One Who
was lifted up on the cross. The message of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>resurrected Lord is “Shalom – peace – reconciliation –
renewed relationship.” This should be the message we focus on, for this is the
message for which Jesus gave His life in order to bring it to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I react when
I think about the fact that I have been gifted and called by GOD, but have
sometimes failed to live up to the calling that I have received? Have I sought
the forgiveness and pardon from GOD for my past failings and sins? What can I
do today, this week, and the rest of my life, to strengthen my relationship
with the Lord Jesus and with others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all knowing and all loving.
Through Your GOoDness, You called Your Son to live the life of the Suffering
Servant. He toiled and worked among us, sometimes to the point of thinking it
was all in vain. He called individuals to share in a close relationship with
Himself and with You. He gave Himself to them over and over again. They
professed their allegiance to Him, yet, in times of greatest temptation, they
were not faithful to the relationship that He had shared with them. We thank
You for the divine wisdom that Jesus manifested in choosing individuals who
were human with human faults and failings. We thank You for Jesus’ choice of
people with whom we can identify because they, in their human conditions, were
not perfect. We thank You for giving us examples that show that humans have
free choices and can refuse the special relationship that Your Son came to
establish. Above all we thank You for the forgiveness and the offer of renewed
relationship that You Son offered (and still offers) to those who fall into sin
and deny their relationship with You. Your Son still speaks the words of
“Shalom – peace – reconciliation – renewed relationship” to us, especially when
we need it most. For this we give You all the glory and praise, as we reflect
on the Hour of Glory that Your Son experienced for our salvation. We lift up
this prayer to You in and through Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Redeemer, Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of Holy Week</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Bernadette Soubrirous:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-bernadette-soubirous</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 50: 4-9a;          Psalm 69: 8-10, 21-22,
31, 33-34;            Matthew  26: 14-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If today’s First Reading sounds familiar, it is.  The First
Reading is the third of the Suffering Servant Songs in Isaiah and is a longer
version of the First Reading on last Sunday, Passion (Palm) Sunday. The Gospel
includes Matthew’s version of part of the Passion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because the person in the Responsorial Psalm is devoted to
GOD and GOD’s presence among mortals, today’s psalm is the prayer of one who is
persecuted by members of his own family (whether that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be one’s immediate blood family or the larger family of the
community).  The psalm speaks of the failure of others to give support and
sympathy.  Even the words “they put gall in my food,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and in my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink” finds its
way into the accounts of Jesus’ crucifixion.  Although the first part of the
psalm sounds gloomy and dark, it ends with giving thanks, glory, and praise to
GOD who hears the cry of the poor (the Anawim).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel relates Judas’ planning to betray Jesus.   He
receives the thirty</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pieces of silver and looks for the time and opportunity to
hand Him over.  For this reason, today is often called “Spy Wednesday.”  Then
the Gospel transitions to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Passover feast and the Seder-Passover (Last) Supper.  At
this meal, Jesus informs His followers that one of them will betray Him.  Judas
asks:  “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” and Jesus responds “You have said it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we contemplate the events of Holy Week, it is easy to
single out Judas and blame Him for the suffering and death of Jesus.  It is
true that he performed a horrendous act in betraying Jesus.  Jesus even says
that it would be better that His betrayer would never have been born.  Yet we
also need to realize two things:  1) each one of us, because of our sinfulness,
is also guilty of betraying Jesus – we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are responsible for the death of Jesus; 2) Jesus freely
chooses to give up His life in order to save us.  It is all part of the plan of
GOD, His Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I think about the fact that my sinfulness is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the turning of my back away from GOD (a theos) and from His
loving mercy, then I too am responsible for betraying and denying the Lord
Jesus and His Abba.  It is so much less threatening to blame it all on Judas,
or the religious leaders of Jesus’ time, or the Romans.  It seems to lessen our
guilt if we can make Judas (or others) the scapegoat.  Yet I am called upon to
take responsibility and be accountable for my own breaking of my relationship
with Jesus.  I need to turn to the Lord Jesus, admit my sinfulness and failings,
and seek the mercy of GOD.  Judas’ greater sin was not being able to accept the
fact that Jesus would forgive him.  I must not become so guilt-ridden that I
end my life as Judas did.  I need to realize the gift of forgiveness and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciliation that Jesus offers to me, in and through His
suffering, death, and resurrection, especially in and through the Sacrament of
Reconciliation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also need to realize that Jesus’ suffering and death are
part of GOD’s plan of salvation.  Jesus chooses to demonstrate and proclaim
GOD’s love by laying down His life for us – for you and for me – in the
dramatic fashion of the painful passion.  The timing of GOD includes Jesus
being born during the Roman occupation of Judea.  Jesus is meant to suffer one
of the most, if not the most, painful means of execution devised.  His pain is
literally excruciating (ex – “from” crucis – “the cross”).  Jesus’ suffering is
meant to show the extent to which GOD was willing to go to bring the GOoD News
of the divine love and forgiveness to us.  The movie, The Passion of the
Christ, which I have seen many times, has brought to many a better sense of the
suffering of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Catechism of the Catholic Church states:  “In her
magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her saints, the Church
has never forgotten that ‘sinners were the authors and the ministers of all the
sufferings that the divine Redeemer endured.’  Taking into account the fact
that our sins affect Christ Himself, the Church does not hesitate to impute to
Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus. .
.” (CCC 598)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings for today and all this week, although heavy
with the impending doom, should also bring us hope and relief.  GOD loves us so
much.  We should be both overwhelmed by what our sinfulness has done to our
relationship with GOD, and also touched by the extremes to which GOD goes in
order to bring us into a closer, restored relationship.  This is the purpose of
Holy Week – to draw us into reality of who we are (sinners) in the sight of GOD
and the reality of Who GOD is, the Lover Who desires to restore us to the full,
loving relationship. We should be moved by the events of Holy Week.  We should
experience the love of GOD reaching out to us, challenging us, uplifting us, loving
us.  We should seek to look beyond our own problems and difficulties and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>give glory, praise, and thanks to GOD (as today’s psalm
reminds us).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think of
who is responsible for the death of Jesus, do I include myself?  Do I see
Jesus’ passion as part of GOD’s plan of revealing divine love to the world,
including me?  What can I do to be more conscious of GOD’s love for me?  How
can I profess and give witness to GOD’s loving plan in my encounters with people
today?  This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  You are the master
of time and events.  Through Your GOoDness, You chose the perfect time for Your
Son to come among us.  You used the events of history and the poor choices of
individuals for the purpose of demonstrating Your love for us and Your desire
that we be drawn into a closer relationship with You.  You permitted Your Son
to be handed over by a sinful individual into the hands of sinners, so that You
might remove the sins of the world through His suffering, death, and
resurrection.  We thank You for giving us Holy Week – the special, annual
reminder of Your love – as revealed in the passion of Your Son.  You ask us to
take the time and to reflect upon the events of Holy Week and be moved to
contrition, so that we can experience the salus (wholeness – holiness –
salvation) You want us to have.  You desire that we die to our sinful selves
and be ready to rise with Your Risen Son, as a way of participating in Your
relationship with us.  May we continue to give glory, praise, and honor to You
and Your Son, Jesus.  We make this prayer in and through Him, our Savior and
Redeemer, our Lover and Lord, Who died and is risen, and is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Thursday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Benedict Joseph Labre: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-benedict-joseph-labre</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Exodus 12: 1-8, 11-14;      Ps 116: 12-13, 15-16,
17-18;      1 Cor. 11: 23-26;        John 13: 1-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Catholic and other mainline Christian traditions,
tonight begins what is known as the Triduum (a word that means “three days”). 
This is the most solemn and important three days of the ecclesiastical year. 
These three days celebrate in solemn and dramatic fashion the Hour of Glory of
Jesus – His giving of Himself, His agony, suffering and death — and His
resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Triduum begins with tonight’s celebration of the Evening
Mass of the Lord’s Supper.  The readings speak of the blood covenants that GOD
established with the Chosen People.  They also speak of signs of GOD’s love and
total care for the Chosen People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading from Exodus recounts the origin of the
Feast of Passover.  Moses tells the Israelites to set this feast at the top of
the calendar, for this is the event that brings them freedom from slavery and
the beginning of a new life.  They are to slaughter a lamb without blemish. 
The blood of the lamb is to be put on the doorposts and lintels (horizontal
part of door frame) of their homes.  They are to feast on the cooked lamb and
celebrate the Passover of the LORD.  Yet even in their celebration, they must
be ready to move on, for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>after the LORD has passed over their houses and the LORD has
saved them from death, they are to leave their old lives of slavery and move
out to journey to the Promised Land.  They are to eat the meal with unleavened
bread, because of their haste and because this is to be new bread, not mixed
with the old leavened bread.  This is the blood covenant relationship GOD is
making with the Chosen People – and through the blood of the lamb, the people
are freed from death and slavery, and are led by their GOD to a new life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist in Psalm 116 questions how he can give GOD
thanksgiving. He decides to take up the cup of salvation and give thanks to
GOD.  The blessing cup used during Passover is filled with wine at four key
points in the Seder (Passover meal).  As the cup is filled the fourth and last
time, a special berakah (blessing) prayer is said.  This is the cup of blessing
during which the Hallel (“Praise”) Psalms are prayed/sung. Psalm 116 continues
in praising GOD and saying that the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>death of one of GOD’s faithful ones is precious in GOD’s
eyes.  The praise offered by the Servant of GOD is His faithful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>service.  The response for the psalm bridges the readings
from Hebrew Scripture (Old Testament) to Christian Scripture</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(New Testament): “Our blessing cup is a communion with the
Blood of Christ.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is no coincidence that Jesus celebrates this feast of
Passover with His followers at His last supper before his death. St. Paul
reminds us of what Jesus did on the night He was handed over.  While saying the
berakah (prayer of praise and blessing) over the unleavened bread, Jesus gives
new meaning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the bread.  It is His Body that will be broken and given
for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all of His followers. They are to continue to break the
bread and recognize the presence of the Lord Jesus when they break the bread in
His memory (zikaron [Hebrew], anamnesis [Greek]).  He will be there, feeding
them with His very Body whenever they break the bread.  St. Paul continues to
speak of what Jesus did at the Seder meal of the Last Supper.  At the end of
the meal, as the fourth cup of wine is passed, Jesus says the berakah over the
cup.  He again gives new meaning to the cup.  It is the cup of His Blood, the
Blood of the new and eternal covenant-relationship. Jesus is the unblemished Lamb
of GOD, Whose Blood will be poured out to set the new</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chosen People free from the slavery to sin and give them new
life through the death of the Lamb.  It is by sharing in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blood of the Lamb of GOD that the reality of this covenant
relationship is manifested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the three Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and
Luke) parallel St. Paul’s account of the Last Supper and focus on Jesus giving
Himself – His Body and Blood – to His disciples during the Last Supper, the
Gospel of John has a different focus.  St. John has already shared Jesus’
speaking about Himself as the Bread of Life and the need of His followers to
eat of His Body and drink of His Blood (in chapter 6 of John’s Gospel).  The
focus of the Last Supper in St. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John’s Gospel is Jesus’ giving of Himself in service.  Thus,
many churches tonight not only celebrate communion as they receive the Body and
Blood of Jesus, but they also re-enact Jesus’ act of service – the washing of
the feet. The symbolism of washing of the feet will be presented through the Gospel
reading.  A renewal of commitment of those who serve the church is also
celebrated in many churches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ washing the feet of His disciples is a powerful
demonstration of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ love for His followers.  Jesus rises from the supper
table, and He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>takes on the role of the servant.  He lovingly washes the
feet of His disciples. The dialog with Peter also shows Peter’s impetuousness.
He refuses to have Jesus, his Master-Teacher, wash his feet.  Jesus says it is
necessary for Him to wash Peter’s feet, otherwise Peter cannot be in
relationship with Him. Peter’s boldness makes him ask to be washed totally by
Jesus.  Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>remarks that only the feet need to be washed if a person is
already clean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus returns to His place at the head of the table, He
reflects on the action He has just done.  He reminds His followers (including
us) that it is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>right that they call Him the Master-Teacher and Lord, for
that is Who He is.  Yet, if the Master washes the feet of His disciples in an
act of service, so then all of the disciples are called to act in similar ways
of serving one another.  Service is the hallmark of the disciple (disciplined
learner) of the Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next four chapters in St. John’s Gospel (14-17) comprise
Jesus’ final “will and testament” to His disciples.  It is a powerful reading,
especially during the Triduum.  Chapter 17 is Jesus’ prayer for His followers
(including us).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the Catholic tradition, tonight’s celebration of the
Lord’s Supper normally ends with a procession with Eucharistic Bread (the Body
of Christ) from the church to an altar of repose. We are invited to journey
along with Jesus as He leaves the Upper Room and goes out into the Garden of
Olives to the place called Gethsemane (“Olive Press”). Here Jesus asks His
followers to pray with Him.  He particular asks His closest three (Peter,
James, and John) to stay awake and pray.  He goes forward and asks His
Abba-Father if there is any way that He need not go through what is about to
happen, and that He be spared.  Yet, Jesus submits to the will of His Abba and
is willing to undergo whatever is necessary for our salvation.  He returns to
find His disciples sleeping.  The question asked of the disciples can be asked
of us:  “Can we not spend at least a little time in prayer with our
Master-Teacher-Lord?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What does it mean to
me that Jesus invites me to eat at His table and to be fed by and with Him?
What can I do to fulfill my call to be a servant to others as my Master-Teacher
has demonstrated through His acts of giving Himself to others? How can I spend
more time in prayer with my Master?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever present and constantly
seeking to reveal Yourself more fully to us.  Through Your GOoDness, You have
called us into the covenant relationship by means of the Blood of the Lamb. 
Instead of smearing blood on the doorpost and lintels of our home, You ask us
to take within ourselves the Blood of Your Lamb so we might be fully united
with Your Son (Who is Your Lamb), and, through Him, be united fully with You. 
You promise us freedom from the slavery of sin and new life if we remember, we
celebrate, we believe all of what Jesus has done to bring us into closer
relationship with You.  Give us the strength and courage to imitate our Master
and Lord in acts of loving service for others.  Help us bring the GOoD News of
Your loving relationship to others by our servant attitude and actions.
Continue to motivate us to stay awake and pray with our Master and Lord as we
reflect on all that He has done to bring us to new life with You.  We thank You
and praise You for allowing us to participate in, and make present, the saving
events of the life of Jesus, Your Son.  And it is in and through Him we make
this prayer, for He is our Master and Lord, the One Who came to serve and save,
our Brother and our Redeemer, Who has died and is risen, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good Friday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed James Oldo:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-james-oldo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 52: 13-53:12;    Psalm 31: 2, 6, 12-13,
15-16, 17, 25;     Hebrews 4: 14-16; 5: 7-9;      John 18: 1 - 19: 42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading is taken from the fourth Suffering Servant
Song in Isaiah.  It speaks of the Suffering Servant as One at Whom no one would
look, suffering at the hands of others, being rejected and stricken, afflicted
and pierced, carrying the sinfulness of others (like a scapegoat), being quiet
in the face of harsh treatment.  This is the Servant Who is oppressed and
condemned and taken away, all for the sake of the sins of others, even though
He has not done anything wrong.  He surrenders himself to death in order to win
pardon for the people’s offenses.   How appropriate this reading is for GOoD
Friday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm for today shows the complete dependence on GOD for
the one who is rejected by people.  Jesus quotes part of this psalm as He is
dying on the cross: “Into your hands I commend my spirit.” This is the prayer
of abandonment and surrender. Jesus hands over everything to His Abba-Father in
the final and total act of submission to the divine will.  In doing so, Jesus
hands us over to His Abba, thus bringing us into a closer relationship with His
Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from the Letter to the Hebrews speaks of Jesus
as the great high priest.  Even though He is GOD, He is also truly human.  In
that way we can identify with Him, and He can identify with us.  Jesus knows,
from an experiential point of view, what it means to be human, to face
problems, to have physical weaknesses, to suffer.  It is for this reason we are
brought into a relationship with One with Whom we can share our stories, since
He has lived through human experiences similar to ours.  Jesus is the One Who
experiences the worst human pains and yet remains in an obedient relationship
with the One Who sent Him – His Abba.  It is in that state of being totally obedient,
even in suffering, that He has become the source of our salus – salvation,
healing, wholeness, holiness.  His physical “brokenness” leads to our spiritual
wholeness. His complete obedient relationship with His Abba leads to our broken
relationship being reconciled and renewed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account of the Lord’s passion is from St. John’s
Gospel.  It begins with Jesus in the Garden.  Jesus seeks to be the
servant-master even in His hour of glory.  He offers Himself to those who have
come to arrest Him.  He twice speaks the words, “I AM” not just as a sign of
commitment to His mission, but as another reminder that He is the great “I AM”
(YHWH). He pleads for the safety of His followers.  He does not want any of
them hurt or having to defend Him because He is doing the will of His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus is being led away to the religious leaders of the
Jewish people, Simon Peter and another disciple follow.  Bold Peter betrays his
boldness by his acts of denial even as Jesus is questioned and condemned. 
Jesus faces His accusers openly and honestly, while Peter sheepishly denies his
relationship with his Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The religious leaders act in ways that will not defile
themselves and make themselves unfit to perform their religious rites, but in
their handing over Jesus to the Romans for crucifixion, the religious leaders
perform the ultimate act of defilement in turning their backs on GOD and the
divine Chosen One Who is GOD.  They seek to make sure they are in right
relationship with the law while trying to destroy the divine Lawgiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Jesus’ dialog with Pilate, He speaks about His kingdom,
not an earthly kingdom built on lies and deception and broken relationships,
but one that is other worldly – based on truth and a relationship with GOD. 
Pilate seeks to save face by trying to avoid making the lethal decision.  He
also seeks to put the religious leaders in a position of being the bad guys in
the eyes of the people, but this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>backfires on Pilate since the religious leaders have stacked
the crowd with their own people who will do the Jewish leaders’ bidding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After having Jesus mocked, scourged, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“crowned” by the Roman soldiers (who were known for their
cruelty to prisoners), Pilate brings Jesus out for the people to see.  “Ecce,
homo!” –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Look at the man” – Jesus, the man like the one in the
reading from Isaiah, at whose appearance it </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is hard for anyone to look.   The crowd is led to shout:
“Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate feels the pressure from the pre-stacked
crowd.  He seeks a way out of having to condemn Jesus.  He is portrayed as one
who does not want to take responsibility for his actions. Jesus speaks about
real leadership qualities of responsibility and authority, that are given by
GOD – leadership by serving others, not by “lording” it over others.  Yet, to avoid
being reported to Caesar as not being loyal to the emperor, Pilate gives into
the desires of those shouting “Crucify Him.”  The people reject their
allegiance to GOD and choose worldly ways rather than GOD’s ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carrying His cross, Jesus is led out to the place outside
the walls of the Holy City of Jerusalem – to Golgotha, Calvary, the “Place of
the Skull.” It is here they nail His hands to the crossbeam and lift Jesus up. 
It is on His cross that His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>name and “crime” are placed: Iesus Nazarenus, Rex Iudaeorum,
“Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” The Roman soldiers divide Jesus’
blood-soaked clothes, His only earthly possession; all done in fulfillment of
Hebrew Scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The agony continues – not only the physical agony that has
included scourging, crowning with thorns, bloody clothes along with flesh being
torn from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His body, nailing, and the pains of crucifixion, but also
the emotional pain – seeing His mother at the foot of His cross.  As one of His
last gifts before He dies, He gives His mother into the care of His beloved
disciple and His disciple into His mother’s care – concerned about others,
especially those whom He loved, to the very end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The end comes, and Jesus surrenders it all.  He gives up His
life as a sign of the perfect relationship with His Abba and the relationship
newly established between His Abba and His followers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the soldiers come to speed up the dying process by
breaking the legs of the crucified (thus preventing them from pushing
themselves up in order to be able to breathe), they notice that Jesus is
already dead.  As the final coup de gras, they pierce Jesus’ side and His
sacred heart, from which flows blood and water.  Jesus pours out the last drop
of blood to bring salus to the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is taken down from the cross and a hurried burial rite
is performed by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. He is laid in the tomb
before the sun sets. Darkness takes over the world, again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, this is GOoD Friday.  GOoD for us.  It is also GOD
Friday.  This is the day when GOD becomes closer to us than ever.  GOD, in
Jesus, shares the final step with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us in the transition from this earthly life to the next.  We
are given the opportunity to be in a new, saved relationship with a GOD Who has
chosen to live among us and die</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with us – die instead of us – die that we might have new
life, new relationship with a forgiving, loving, and saving GOD. This “end” is
not the end but the beginning of eternal life for Jesus – and for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How does my reflecting
on the death of Jesus make me feel? Do I have any new insights into the
importance of Jesus’ death?  How can I make the reality of the salvific
relationship that I have with the Lord Jesus more alive in my relationships
with others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, so unbelievably loving. Your
desire to be in relationship with us is demonstrated in the life and death of
Your Suffering Servant and Son, Jesus. He came not only to share Your GOoD News
with us, but also share our human life with us, so that we could share in His
relationship with You. Knowing the costs, He still submitted to Your will and
gave Himself fully to us. He was willing to give His last drop of blood so that
we might be cleansed and made holy in Your sight. He died so that we might live.
As He said, “No greater love is there than this, that one gives one’s life for
another.” Jesus, Your Son and our Master-Teacher, gave us the perfect example
of servant leadership. We praise You and thank You for the gift of Your Son and
the sacrifice He made on our behalf. Helps us to be faithful to the
relationship that He has given us through His own suffering and death. We make
this prayer through our saving Lord, Jesus, Your Son, Who has died, but is
risen and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Saturday - Easter Vigil</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Gianna Beretta Molla:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings for the Easter Vigil:  I.  (Genesis 1:1--2:2;  Ps
104:1-2, 5-6, 10, 12, 13-14, 24, 35);  II.  (Genesis 22:1-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18; Ps 16:5, 8, 9-10, 11); III.  (Exodus 14:15--15:1;  Ex
15:1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 17-18); IV.  (Isaiah 54:5-14; Ps</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30:2, 4, 5-6, 11-12, 13); V.  (Isaiah 55:1-11;  Is 12:2-3, 4,
5-6);  VI.  (Baruch 3:9-15, 32--4:4;  Ps 19:8, 9, 10,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11);  VII.  (Ezekiel 36:16-17a, 18-28; Ps 42:3, 5; 43:3,
4);  VIII.  (Romans 6:3-11;  Ps 118:1-2, 16-17, 22-23); Gospel:  Luke 24: 1-12)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today (Holy Saturday) is a day of nothingness.  During the
daytime, liturgically speaking in the mainline Church tradition, nothing
happens.  It is a day of sorrow, a day for reflection.  It is a day between the
death of Jesus (GOoD Friday) and His Resurrection (Easter).  There are no
readings for Saturday because in the Catholic tradition, nothing happens on
this day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Things change when the sun sets and, according to Jewish and
Christian tradition, Sunday begins.  In the darkness that begins Sunday
(Saturday night after sunset), Christians assemble to keep a vigil for the Lord
Jesus. We reflect on the story of salvation, from the beginning of the world to
the third day after Jesus’ death.  We wait in hopeful anticipation that the
Lord Jesus will keep His promise and rise.  We look forward to new life, not
just for Jesus, but also for all believers, especially those who would be
welcomed into the Christian community on this vigil above all vigils, this
liturgical celebration that surpasses all liturgical celebrations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the Catholic and other mainline Christian traditions,
the Easter Vigil is different from any other liturgical celebration.  The
service has four parts:  1) The Liturgy of Fire; 2) The Liturgy of the Word; 3)
The Liturgy of Water and Baptism and Initiation;  4) The Liturgy of the
Eucharist.  (Some services will reverse the order of the first two parts.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the darkness at the beginning of this vigil service, a
fire is enkindled.  It is the Light of the Risen Christ.  From this new fire,
the Paschal (also called “Easter” or “Christ”) Candle is lit.  The Light of
Christ is carried in procession into the darkened church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Light of Christ is welcomed into the darkened church,
each participant has her/his candle lit from the Paschal Candle.  Soon, all are
enlightened by the Light of Risen Lord.  Joyfully the Exsultet is sung as all
stand in the Light of Christ.  The Exsultet is a hymn to the Risen Lord. It
speaks of the necessary sin of Adam that led to the promise of a Redeemer.  It
proclaims the fulfillment of Hebrew scriptures in the coming of Jesus, the
Light, the Life of the World.  [For the words of the Exsultet click the
following link: (the left column is the Latin text, the middle column is the
new translation and the right column is the older English translation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the second part of the celebration – the Liturgy of the
Word – the assembled faith community listens to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their history being retold.  Just as the Israelites retold,
remembered, and relived (zikaron) their story (Haggadah)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>each Passover, we tell our story – GOD’s story.  We make
present the events related in the story.  We see GOD’s plan at work as the
story is told.  The story of salvation consists of seven readings (each with a
Responsorial) from Hebrew scripture.  (For pastoral reasons, these seven
readings can be reduced to a minimum of three [usually # I. and # III and one
of the readings from the Prophets.)   These readings tell our story, beginning
with GOD’s creation of the world until the final promise of a savior.  (I will
reflect briefly on each of these readings following the description of the
Easter Vigil.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After hearing our story as summarized in Hebrew scripture,
we joyfully proclaim the Glory to GOD, with bells ringing, as we transition to
the Christian scriptures and the continued story of our salvation.  Although
the lights could be turned on earlier, some wait until this time in the Vigil. 
It is then that the full splendor of the church is demonstrated as all lights
are turned on and flowers and decorations become visible.  We hear St. Paul’s
words </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>summarizing the whole paschal mystery:  our dying with the
suffering Christ, so that we might share in the life of the Risen Christ. 
Joyously the A-word is sung for the first time in over 40 days.  Alleluia is
the word that proclaims, “Praise to the LORD” Who is now risen and living among
us.  This joyous word is called the Resurrection Word.  The Gospel of the Lord
Jesus’ resurrection is then proclaimed.  This year, the Gospel is from St.
Luke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Liturgy of Water and Baptism begins with asking the Holy
Ones (Saints), who have proceeded us into the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>glory of the Reign of GOD, to join us as we prepare to
invoke GOD’s blessing on the new water of Baptism and welcome new members into
our Christian community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We recall how water has had such a powerful position in our,
or rather GOD’s, salvation history:  from the waters of creation, to the waters
of the Flood, to the waters of the Red Sea, to the waters of the River Jordan.
Water has been a sign of change from death to life.  The Paschal Candle of
Risen Lord Jesus is placed into the waters and the Holy Spirit is breathed into
the water as we ask GOD to bless the water that will bring new life to those
who will be plunged (baptizo) and washed in the water.  A profession of faith
is asked first of those who would be joining the Christian community and then
of the community as a whole.  We recommit ourselves to turning away from sin
and evil and the deepening of our relationship with the GOD Who is Abba-Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who were asking to be a part of this Christian
relationship are called to the waters of baptism and are“plunged” (baptizein) into
the water where they die to sin and are raised to the new life with the Risen
Lord Jesus.  They are then clothed with a white garment to show their putting
on Christ.  They are given their own candles that are lit from the Paschal
Candle of the Risen Lord to symbolize they have been enlightened by Christ and
are expected to walk as children of the Light.  In receiving the Sacrament of
Confirmation, the newly baptized are strengthened and confirmed by the Holy
Spirit using Chrism, the oil of dedication, the oil of the Anointed One, the
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The final part of the Great Vigil is the celebration of Eucharist. 
We continue to “eucharistize” (give thanks to) GOD the Abba-Father by
remembering (re-enacting - zikaron) Jesus’ giving of Himself as our food and
nourishment. For the first time our newest members of the community join us at
that table of the Lord Jesus.  They join us in the prayer of thanks and in receiving
the Risen Lord.  The vigil ends with joyful dismissal to take what we have
celebrated and share with others the message of the Risen Lord, Alleluia,
Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the Great Vigil of Easter.  Every time I participate
in this ceremony, the greatest of all liturgical</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>services, I am humbled, excited, re-enlivened.  This year, I
look forward to the new life that GOD will give to all of us,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to share briefly on the readings of the Easter
Vigil.  I invite you to take the time, today, if you can, to reflect on each of
the readings and see how they fit into the telling of the story of salvation –
our story – GOD’s story of relationship with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I.  The story begins “in the beginning” – in Greek: 
Genesis.  GOD wants to share the relationship that is the essence of Who GOD
is.  The relationship that flows within the Trinity is so powerful, it is
creative.  GOD speaks, and it happens.  GOD creates what is GOoD.  The climax
of creation is the sharing of life with the humans who are created in the image
and likeness of GOD. They are called to be people of relationship, just as GOD
is the GOD of relationship.  They are called to be in relationship with each
other and with GOD.  GOD sees this and proclaims, “This is very GOoD!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>II.   The relationship between GOD and mortals is renewed in
the covenant relationship with Abraham.  Abraham is asked to show the fullness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of his commitment to this relationship by sacrificing his
son, the one in whom the promise of covenant was to be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continued.  Abraham shows his priority and his trust by
putting his relationship with GOD higher than his relationship with his son. 
This priority of putting relationship with GOD first will be demonstrated fully
in another Son Who will be sacrificed in complete obedience to His Abba-Father’s
(GOD’s) will.  And Abraham’s son (like GOD’s Son) carries the wood of the
sacrifice up the mountain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>III.   The story of the Exodus continues to show the
covenant relationship GOD has with Chosen People.  They, in their slavery, have
cried out to GOD.  GOD hears them and sends them a prophet (Moses) who works
great signs to set them free from their slavery.  They journey through the
waters of the Red Sea and are brought to safety while the water destroys the
evilness of those who have held them in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>slavery.  This image of water destroying evil and bring new
life to those who travel through it are brought to full meaning in the
sacrament of baptism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IV.   GOD speaks through the words of Isaiah.  GOD promises
to renew the covenant relationship that was made with Noah after the flood
waters destroyed the evilness of humanity.  GOD desires a close relationship
with the people who are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>called GOD’s own.  GOD will be their redeemer and provide
richness beyond their understanding.  GOD, not just GOD’s spokespersons, will
be their Teacher; GOD will instruct the children of GOD.  It is in Jesus that
the fullness of this renewed relationship will take place.  GOD the Son is the
Teacher and the Redeemer Who welcomes all into the ever-deepening relationship with
the Triune GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>V.   GOD invites those who desire a closer relationship with
the Divine to forsake their past ways of sin and seek the LORD.  GOD speaks to
those who are worried that they do not have what it takes to participate in
this relationship, saying:  “Come, I will provide for you.  All you need do is
turn fully to Me.”  GOD will supply every want and need, if we but turn fully
to GOD (ad Deum) and turn away from sin (that is “against GOD” - a theos).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VI.   Wisdom is a gift that flows from a relationship with
GOD.  It also leads back to an even closer relationship.  Wisdom is being aware
of what GOD has done, is doing, and will continue to do for all of GOD’s Holy
People, the Divinely Chosen People.  It is in reflecting on the story of GOD’s
relationship with us that we are drawn even closer into that relationship. 
“Give not your glory to another. . .Blessed (Holy) are we, for we know what
pleases GOD” – a closer relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VII.   GOD reminds those who have been called by the LORD,
that even if they have turned away from GOD (a theos), GOD will remain faithful
to the covenant relationship that GOD has established.  The LORD will renew the
covenant relationship because of Who GOD is – the GOD of relationship.  GOD
will pour out water to cleanse the unfaithful from their sins.  GOD will
breathe GOD’s own Spirit into them and renew them.  GOD will replace the hard,
stony hearts of the unfaithful people, with hearts that are one with GOD.  GOD
has promised and GOD will fulfill that promise – in Christ Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VIII.  In his testimonial letter to the Romans, St. Paul
summarizes what it means to be in relationship with Christ Jesus:  We are
baptized into Jesus’s death and our sinful lives cease to exist, so we can be
raised out of the waters to share in the new life of the Risen Lord Jesus. 
Thus, we must consider ourselves as dead to sin and alive with the Risen
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel (Luke 24: 1-10):  Mary Magdalene and the other women
come</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the tomb early in the morning on the third day.  As they
approach the burial place, they see that the stone has already been removed.
They</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are told by two individuals (messengers = angels) dressed in
dazzling garments: “the Lord Whom you seek is not among the dead, but that He
is alive,” and He seeks to be in further relationship with His followers. They
are to go and announce this message to His disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These women become the first to announce and experience that
Jesus is alive, restoring relationship with God.  Alleluia! Although the women
announce the message to the apostles, the apostles do not believe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter runs to the tomb and finds it empty, except for the
burial cloths. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    As I reflect on
the history of salvation as celebrated in the Easter Vigil, what stands out the
most for me? Do I experience the plan of GOD being revealed through the
readings and the liturgy, and in my life? How can I die more to sin and live a
life that proclaims the GOoD News of the Risen Lord Jesus? What can I do to
help others experience the salvation that comes through Jesus’ death and
resurrection?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever faithful and always desirous
of relationship with us.  Through Your GOoDness, You have continued to
demonstrate Your covenant relationship with humanity from the first moments of
creation until the end of time.  You have renewed Your promises of being
faithful even though Your Chosen People have turned their backs on You, again,
and again, and again.  You have sent Your prophets (spokespersons) to a wayward
people, challenging them to turn to You.  In the fullness of time, You sent
Your Son to walk among us and proclaim the GOoD News of Your ongoing desire to
have a relationship with us.  He gave continual witness to the way things
should be between You and Your People whom You have made holy.  Yet, it was not
until</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He gave the ultimate sacrifice of Himself in His death on
the cross that the fullness of the proclamation could be seen.  As we celebrate
His Risen Life, we see the glory that He is sharing with us, as You continue to
gift us with new life in and through Jesus, our Risen Lord.  May we continue to
be strengthened by Your Holy Spirit so we can proclaim the GOoD News of Your
loving relationship with us.  May we continue to die to sin, so as to rise with
our Risen Lord and Master-Teacher.  As always, we make this prayer in the name
of the Risen Lord, Jesus, Who is Your Son and our Brother, Our Redeemer, and
Who is living and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reigning with You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen!   Alleluia!   Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Easter Sunday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Conrad of Parzham: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-conrad-of-parzham</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:             Acts 10: 34a, 37-43;        Psalm 118:
1-2, 16-17, 22-23;     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Col 3: 1-4    or   1 Cor. 5: 6b-8;     John
20: 1-9    or   Mark 16: 1-7   or           Luke 24: 13-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Resurrexit sicut dixit! Alleluia!  He has risen just as He
said! Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we solemnly celebrate the resurrection of Jesus the
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings remind us that it is not just a historical fact
that Jesus rose from the dead, but it is a life-transforming event, not only
for Jesus, but also for all who believe in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the Easter Season, the First Reading is not from
Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament) but from the Acts of the Apostles.  We
can see the effect that the resurrection of Jesus had on His followers. Today’s
reading is from the Peter’s speech proclaiming the person of Jesus, not only as
miracle worker and a great preacher, but as One Who has died but is risen and
has appeared to His followers.  Not only has Jesus been seen by His disciples,
but He has eaten and drunk with them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– a sign that He is not just an illusion but a person with a
body – glorified body, but still a body.  Because Jesus is risen and has
appeared to His followers, they are commissioned to announce His message and
continue His ministry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm that is used during Easter Week speaks about the
stone rejected by the builders.  This is a reference to the “Temple” that Jesus
said the religious leaders would destroy, but that He would build up again in
three days – the “Temple” of His body.  The leaders had rejected Him, but GOD
chose not only to accept Jesus, but to build the new House of GOD through the
death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a choice of one of the two Second Readings that can
be read.  Both speak about the link between Jesus’ death and resurrection and
the life of His followers.  Because Jesus died and is risen, those who believe
in Him must die to sin and self interests and rise to the new life which Jesus
gives through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Johannine Gospel (John 20: 1-9) relates the account of
Mary Magdalen going to the tomb before the sun rose on Easter Sunday morning. 
Expecting to see the tomb still sealed, she plans to keep vigil at the tomb. 
She is surprised to find the sealing rock removed and the tomb empty.  Still
not fully understanding what has taken place, she runs to the frightened and
saddened disciples and tells them about the empty tomb.  She wonders where they
have taken the body.  Peter and John hasten back to the tomb.  John, being
younger and probably more athletic, arrives at the tomb, but does not enter it
until Peter reaches the tomb.  As they enter and see the burial clothes neatly
folded, they realize something special has happened. It seems that John quickly
believes in a miracle – the fulfillment of Jesus’ promises to rise again. 
Peter, the one who had denied his Lord three times, does not seem quite so
quick to accept the idea of Jesus’ resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel proclaimed at the Easter Vigil (Luke 24: 1-12)
can also be proclaimed.  Mary Magdalene and the other women come to the tomb
early in the morning on the third day.  As they approach the burial place, they
see that the stone has already been removed.  They are told by two beings
(messengers – angels) that the Lord Whom they seek is not among the dead but
that He is alive and seeks to be in further relationship with His followers.
They are to go and announce this message to His disciples.  These women become
the first to announce and experience that Jesus is alive, restoring
relationship with God.  Alleluia! Although the women announce the message to
the apostles, the apostles do not believe. Peter runs to the tomb and finds it
empty, except for the burial cloths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For afternoon Easter Liturgies, the Gospel of Luke 24: 13-35
can be used.  It is the account of what took place in the late afternoon on the
day of Jesus’ resurrection.  Two of Jesus’ disciples are leaving Jerusalem,
disillusioned by the death of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus three days before.  Their hope is gone, even though
some other followers of Jesus have seen an empty tomb.  As they journey along,
they talk to another Person traveling along the same road.  This third
Individual does not seem to be downhearted. They wonder if this Person has
heard what happened during the last few days.  They share how they had hoped
that Jesus would have been the Messiah (the Christ) – the liberator, but Jesus
was crucified and died on Friday.  The third Person starts to share with them
the Hebrew scriptures that speak of the necessity of the Messiah’s having to
suffer and die in order to truly bring salus (salvation, healing, wholeness) to
the people of God. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two disciples are uplifted by their traveling Companion.
As they reach their destination for the evening, they give an invitation: “Stay
with us.”  As they sit down for a meal, the Guest takes bread, says a berakah
(prayer of blessing/thanks), breaks the bread, and distributes it to the two
disciples.  By this action the eyes of the disciples are opened, and they
recognize their Lord and Master-Teacher, Jesus, the Risen One.  Their
excitement and enthusiasm cannot be contained.  As the Lord Jesus disappears
from their sight, they race back the seven miles to the Upper Room in Jerusalem
to tell the other believers that they had experienced the Risen Lord in the
breaking of the bread.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I wonder how I would have
reacted if I had been at the tomb on that first Easter Sunday as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>were Mary, Peter, and John.  I, like Mary, might have been
confused, thinking that someone had taken the body of Jesus to another place. 
I doubt if I would have had the immediate response of John, and been able to
put it all together and realize that Jesus was fulfilling what He had promised
– to rise from the dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can readily identify with Peter.  I realize that I have
denied my Lord Jesus many times with my sins.  I am reminded of a song by Don
Francisco entitled He’s Alive.  The song is Peter’s response to the death of
Jesus.  I can identify with the song.  In one key part of the song, in
referring to the empty tomb, Peter says: “Something strange had happened there
/ just what I did not know. / John believed a miracle / but I just turned to
go. / Circumstance and speculation / didn't lift me very high / 'cause I'd seen
them crucify Him, / and then I saw Him die. / Back inside the house again / the
guilt and anguish came / everything I'd promised Him / just added to my shame.”
Being sinful, it is hard to understand and believe that Jesus died AND ROSE for
me.  Yet the message of today (Easter Sunday) and Jesus’ death and resurrection
is found in the final refrain of the song: “He’s alive, He’s alive, and I’m
forgiven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our lives as disciples of Jesus require us to not only
believe in the forgiveness and peace and salvation which come to me and others
through Jesus’ death and resurrection, but to be witnesses of the Risen Lord to
others.  We must be Easter people, Alleluia people.  We must be Risen and Saved
people because our Lord Jesus has died, and is risen, as He said. Resurrexit
sicut dixit! Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think of my
own sinfulness and the gift that Jesus has given to me through His death and
resurrection, what is my reaction?  Can I relate to Peter and his experience
first at the empty tomb and then when Jesus appeared to him on Easter Sunday
afternoon? How will I live out my call, a call similar to Mary of Magdala,
Peter, and John, and the two disciples of Emmaus, to announce the GOoD News of
Jesus’ resurrection?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and forgiving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to announce the GOoD News
of salvation.  We celebrate today the Hour of Glory as Jesus passes from His
death on the cross to the full glory of His resurrection. This is not just a
day for us to remember what happened about 2000 years ago.  This is the day we
celebrate our forgiveness and new life.  It is because Jesus died and is alive
that we know that we are forgiven of our sins.  We give You all the glory and
praise for how You brought about our salvation.  We thank You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for sending us Your very best – Your Son, Jesus.  May we
continue to celebrate our new life as we celebrate the day of His resurrection,
not only today, but also every day of our existence.  For He is our Savior and
Lord, Who now is alive and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia! Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Easter Monday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Anselm:  https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-anselm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 2: 14, 22-33;       Psalm 16: 1-2a and 5,
7-8, 9-10, 11;        Matthew 28: 8-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Easter to you!  We continue the full celebration of
Easter this week.  The Gospels this week are mostly accounts of the first
Easter Sunday.  The proper prayers used in the liturgies of this week speak
about this day being Easter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the seven weeks of Easter our First Reading will be
taken from the Acts of the Apostles.  We will hear how the early Christians
lived out their experiences of the Risen Lord and proclaimed those experiences
in the days following Jesus’ ascension into heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading is St. Peter’s first sermon just after
he and the other apostles and disciples received the Holy Spirit on Pentecost. 
Peter boldly proclaims the fulfillment of the promises made by GOD in ages
past. He focuses on the psalm of David, that is the psalm of this day.  Peter
shares with those who hear him that the David was not talking about himself
when he spoke about GOD not abandoning the soul of the Chosen One to the nether
world or allowing the Faithful One to undergo corruption.  Peter points out
that the words of this psalm are fulfilled in the Messiah/Christ, Jesus. 
Although Jesus was crucified, He also has been raised up on the third day.  
Peter remarks that he and the other apostles</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are witnesses to the Risen Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     In the Gospel we once again hear the account of the
women, who had come out to the tomb to perform burial rites for Jesus.  
Today’s passage begins as the women are following the directions given to them
by the angel by running to announce the message of His resurrection to the
group of believers who are still mourning Jesus’ death.  The women are greeted
by Jesus Who tells them to go to the apostles and to share the GOoD News of
Jesus’ resurrection.  We also hear how the religious leaders develop a plan to
cover up Jesus’ resurrection and spread the false report that Jesus’ followers
had taken the body during the night.  [This is brought out in the movie,
Risen.  An interesting note is the translation of a word in verse 10:  Jesus
tells the women to tell the apostles to go to “Galilee.”  The Greek words in
verse 10 are:  τὴν Γαλιλαίαν that can be translated as “Galilee” or “the
Galilean.”  According to John 20: 2 and 18, Mary lets Peter (the Galilean?)
know that the tomb is empty, and that Jesus is risen.  Peter and the other
disciples are still in Jerusalem.]I am still joyful after beginning the Easter
celebrations this past weekend.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     I am still enthusiastic (en - “in” theos - “GOD”) after
celebrating the Life of the Risen Lord.  Easter is a lot different from what I
celebrated as a child.  It is not about eggs and candy, although they can be
explained in ways that reflect Easter. Easter is the celebration of life – or
better – of the Life, that is, the One Who is the Life and the Resurrection. 
It is what Christianity is all about.  We celebrate that death has been
conquered and sin has been destroyed.  It is the day when GOD has reconciled
all who have been a-theos (away from or against GOD), and who are now able to
be ad Deum (moving “toward GOD”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ mission was accomplished in His death and
resurrection.  He did not come to establish a religion in the sense of formal
institution. Jesus came to re-ligio (“bind again”) – that is, He came that He
might bind all of us to GOD again, after we had broken the bond that GOD
originally had with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We now have been re-connected with GOD through Jesus’ death
and resurrection.  We have life, even if we die physically.  We are in
communion – “union with” – with the GOD Who loves us and has sent us the very
best</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– the Son Who is our Life and Resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to celebrate Easter, and, especially as we continue
to be filled with the Holy Spirit (as Peter and the other apostles and
disciples were on Pentecost), let us stand up and boldly proclaim the message
that Jesus came to bring to the world:  We are once “again bound” with a GOD
Who loves us – We are drawn into a closer relationship with an Abba-Father Who
is GOD.  Let us reflect on our own experiences of the Risen Lord Jesus and be
witnesses to the Lord Who is alive and with us.  Let us continue to proclaim
that “He is Risen! Alleluia!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What difference
does the Resurrection of Jesus make in my daily living?  How can I continue to
celebrate Easter today? all this Easter week?  during the seven weeks of the
Easter season?  All year long?  All my life long? All eternity? What can I do
to bring the joy of the Risen Lord Jesus to those who are still living in dead
relationships and are not bound with Jesus and His Abba, in the unity of the
Holy Spirit?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever powerful and yet ever
gentle.  Through Your GOoDness, You have continually called Your Holy People
into a closer relationship with You, but at times we have ignored Your message
and turned our back on You.  You never gave up wanting us to be bound to You
once again.  You have sent Your Son to live out the fullness of that
relationship in His earthly life.  His “dying and rising” event has restored
the bond that unites us with You.  You only ask us to turn our attention more
fully to You and Your Son. You promise us a share in the new life of the Risen
Lord.  May we grow in appreciation of You and our relationship with You. 
Through the power of the Holy Spirit, may we give witness to this GOoD News by
lives that reflect our following of Your Son, Jesus.  For He is our Risen Lord,
our Savior, the Bond which (Who) unites us to You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, now and for ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Easter Tuesday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Adalbert of Prague:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-adalbert-of-prague
[Feast Day tomorrow, April 23]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 2: 36-41;           Psalm 33: 4-5, 18-19, 20
and 22;          John 20: 11-18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Easter Day celebration continues.  Jesus the Christ is
truly risen!  Alleluia!  Today we hear St. Peter and St. Mary Magdalen profess
their faith in Jesus’ resurrection.  After their experience of the Risen Lord,
they were never the same.  They could never go back to who they were before
Jesus came into their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading continues St. Peter’s first sermon that
took place on Pentecost Sunday.  Peter has experienced the Risen Lord over the
course of the last 50 days.  He has been confirmed and strengthened by the Holy
Spirit.  Unlike his actions 53 days before, when he denied Jesus, his Lord;
Peter is willing to step out in faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and give witness to Jesus and His message.  The passage
today begins with these words of Peter:  “Let the whole house of Israel know
beyond any doubt that GOD has made both Lord and Messiah this Jesus Whom you
have crucified.”  Some of those who hear Peter’s proclamation ask what they are
to do in response.  Peter reminds his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>audience that it was the Jewish people whom GOD first called
to faith.  Those who would believe in Jesus must reform their lives and turn to
the Lord Jesus Who forgives sins.  They are to have their relationship and
their bond with GOD re-established and deepened through being baptized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reminds us that GOD is the source of help for
those who call upon the LORD.  GOD is known for divine GOoDness and kindness. 
These words speak of GOD’s desire to be in relationship with all those who turn
to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Third Day of Easter’s Gospel is St. John’s account of
Mary Magdalen at the tomb.  She weeps at the thought of her Lord being dead and
especially when the body is not where it had been laid on Friday afternoon. 
Even though angels (messengers) in dazzling robes are seated in the empty tomb,
she is still confused.  She does not fully comprehend that Jesus is truly
risen.  As she sees a Person whom she takes as the Gardener, she asks where
Jesus’ body has been taken.  It is only when the supposed Gardener calls her by
name that she realizes that He is Jesus.  She professes her belief by saying,
“Rabbouni,” a word that implies a personal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with her Teacher.  It is a word of intimacy and
could be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>translated as “My Own Dear Teacher.”  Mary runs off to
announce the message to the disciples:  “I have seen the Lord!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today speak of the new relationship that both
Peter and Mary have with the Risen Lord.  Jesus is The Messiah, The Lord, The
Teacher.  Each of these titles manifest a deeper understanding of Who Jesus is
in the lives of the believers, in the lives of those who have experienced the
Risen One.  Peter can speak from the events in his own life that Jesus is the
Anointed One, the Messiah, the Christ.  He is the One for Whom the Jewish</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people have been waiting.  Jesus has fulfilled all the
promises of old and is truly the great Prophet Who speaks for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD because He is one with GOD; He is GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter can thus profess Jesus is LORD.  “LORD” is the
translation for the Hebrew word Adonai, a word used by the Jewish people when
they come to the word for the personal and proper name for GOD, YHWH (sometimes
translated as “The One Who Is” or “I AM Who AM” or simply “I AM”).  Peter is
professing that Jesus is equal to, and one with, the GOD Who revealed to Moses
the divine name of GOD.  Peter has been able to spend time with “The One Who
Is.”  He has developed a personal relationship with Jesus and has come to
“know” (not just have head knowledge, but personally experience) Jesus’
relationship with the Abba-Father.  And since Peter has just been filled with
the Holy Spirit, his understanding of Jesus has been enlightened and
strengthened.  It is thus that Peter can make such bold proclamation, not
fearing those who seven weeks before put Jesus to death.  Peter </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is enthused (en = in, theu = GOD).  GOD is in and with him. 
Peter will never be the same again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary also goes through a transformation.  On Easter Sunday
morning she has come to the tomb to weep for her own dear Teacher, her
Rabbouni.  He has been put to death.  She saw Him being nailed, bleeding, and
eventually dying.  She thinks that the least she can do is to come to the tomb
to be one with Him in His death. Even when she sees the empty tomb and two
beings in dazzling robes, she does not fully understand what it all means.  It
is only when Jesus calls her by name that she recognizes that “her own dear
Teacher” is alive and with her, that her sorrow is turned to joy.  She cannot
wait to run and tell the other disciples that “her Teacher” is alive.  Mary’s
relationship with Jesus is deepened as the Risen One calls her by name.  The
disciplined learner (disciple) is once again united with “her own dear
Teacher.”  She will never be the same again.  She is truly the apostle to the
apostles - the one sent to announce the message of Life to those who are also
sent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on how Peter and Mary changed as they
experienced the Risen Lord and how they grew in their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understanding of Who Jesus is, especially by the power of
the Holy Spirit, I realize that the more I come to reflect on the Risen One,
the Christ, the LORD, my own dear Teacher, then the more I will be drawn into
relationship with Jesus and His Abba through the workings of the Holy Spirit. 
I am challenged to spend more time reflecting on my connection with the
Master-Teacher.  Jesus continues to call me by name.  I need to be open to His
calling and respond with enthusiasm (en - in; theu GOD), for GOD is with me the
more that I seek to follow Jesus’s calling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, I must continue to spend time deepening my
understanding of the Risen Lord.  My time of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflecting on the GOoD News of Jesus should not decrease
just because Lent is over.  My resolution to be more aware of GOD’s working in
my life should be strengthened and renewed because Jesus is Risen.  I can never
be the same as I was.  I can never go back to spending less time with my
Master-Teacher.  I have come to a new awareness of the relationship I have with
Jesus and His Abba.  My life is being transformed.  It is something that
enriches me and leads me to go out and share my experiences with others, with those
whom GOD has placed along my journey.  Just as Mary and Peter could not hold
within themselves the GOoD News about their relationship with the Risen Lord, I
also want to let others know the GOoD News.  It may begin with sharing with
other disciples, as did Mary on Easter Sunday.  It may develop, with the
further outpouring of the Holy Spirit, to my proclaiming boldly before
non-believers, as did Peter on Pentecost.  I need to be open to how the Master-
Teacher wants me to give witness to my renewed relationship with Him – the
Risen Lord – “my Risen Lord and teacher.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  In what ways have I
experienced the presence of the Risen Lord Jesus in my life? How can I give
witness to the fact that I have changed from the person I was before to an
individual who has been touched by the Risen Lord? To whom is the Lord Jesus
sending me today to announce by my action (and words, if necessary) that Jesus
is alive and with us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever revealing Yourself to us,
especially through Your Son and His Resurrection and the outpouring of Your
Holy Spirit.  Through Your GOoDness, You have chosen to make us sharers in the
ministry of Jesus.  Jesus, our Master-Teacher, calls us to be His disciples. 
He reveals You to us. He draws us into relationship with Himself and with You. 
He wants us to go out and share this GOoD News with others.  As we continue to
become more fully aware of the presence of the Risen Lord in our lives and as
we are further empowered by the Holy Spirit, may we give witness to the
relationship that You have established in and through Jesus, the Risen Lord. 
Continue to strengthen us with the Easter message that Jesus is alive and with
us.  And may we give You all the glory and praise as others come to know Your
love in their own relationship with You.  We pray this in the name of Jesus,
the Risen Lord, the Christ, our Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings are very exciting and enthusiastic.  Peter
and John perform great signs in the name of Jesus, the Risen Lord (First
Reading).  Two disciples of Jesus are able to recognize the Risen Lord in the
breaking of the bread (Gospel).  Jesus’ ministry continues in the members of
the early</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christian community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Readings takes place soon after the Pentecost
experience of the coming of the Holy Spirit.  As Peter and John walk through
the temple area, they see a beggar sitting by the side of their path.  Peter
attracts the crippled man’s attention.  The invalid is hoping for a big
financial donation.  Peter remarks that he and John have neither silver nor
gold, but what they have is a relationship with Jesus, the Risen Lord.  In
Jesus’ name they impart a healing upon the man.  The man receives something
more valuable than money – he received new life in the name of Jesus.  He jumps
around and praises GOD for his healing.  Thus, the GOoD News is being
proclaimed by the followers of Jesus, and Jesus is present in their ministry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for the great things
GOD continues to do through GOD’s chosen ones.  GOD is faithful to the divine
promises.  GOD remembers the covenant relationship that GOD established with
GOD’s servants, GOD’s chosen ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel account relates the story of the two disciples on
their way to Emmaus (“warm springs”).  They are saddened by the events of the
last few days.  They had hoped that Jesus was the Messiah (the Christ), and now
He has been crucified and is dead, or so they think.  They were not even joyful
when they heard the news that some women followers of Jesus had reportedly seen
a vision of angels telling them that their Lord is alive. Their hopes had not
been lifted since they had not yet experienced the Risen Lord themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they journey along, they are meet by a Man Who does not
share their sadness.  They start to talk to the Man about what has happened
over the course of the last few days.  They relate Jesus’ crucifixion.  Their
traveling “Companion” begins to share with them the Hebrew scriptures that
spoke about the Suffering Servant Who would have to experience pain in order to
bring about glory.  The two disciples start getting excited as they hear how
the Word of GOD had spoken of the suffering of the Messiah.  They begin to have
hope again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they near Emmaus, they invite the Stranger and new
“Companion” to come and share more with them.  As they sit at table, the
Stranger blesses the bread with a prayer of praise (berakah) and then he breaks
the bread.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples’ eyes are open and they recognize the Risen Lord
in the breaking of the bread.  As the Lord Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disappears, the two disciples run back the seven miles to
Jerusalem to tell the other followers of Jesus that they, too, have experienced
the Risen Lord in the breaking of the bread.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This passage is one of my favorite Resurrection accounts. 
The events parallel our liturgical services with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist.  It
reminds me that we can come to have a burning in our </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hearts as we hear the GOoD News of Jesus.  The more we
listen and study the Word, the more we understand the ministry of Jesus and
that Jesus’ mission and ministry had to include His suffering, death – and
resurrection. It also says to me that we can come into a closer relationship
with Jesus and realize His presence with us as we break the bread and remember,
celebrate, and believe that the Risen Lord is with us.  We truly have Jesus as
our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Companion” – a word that literally means “someone with whom
we share bread.”  And after we have once again been feed with the Word, and
from the table of the Lord Jesus, we need to go out and share the Lord’s presence
with others, announcing that we, too, have experienced the Risen Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every time we come together in the name of the Risen Lord,
and hear the Word proclaimed and break bread, we experience Jesus’ presence
with us.  It is then we can reach out to others and give them a gift, not
necessarily of gold or silver, but of healing in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
The healing we extend may not be as dramatic as the cure of the crippled man in
the First Reading.  It may be as simple as our smiling at them, bringing joy to
them.  We also need to realize that it is not ourselves who perform any “cure”
that may take place.  We are there to “care for” others and let them experience
the presence of the Lord Jesus Who is the One Who cures.  Great things can and
will happen if we continue to stay focused on the Risen Lord revealing Himself
in Word and the breaking of bread.  We will be able to reach out to others
because Jesus is our “Companion.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Is my heart
burning within me when I hear GOD’s Word proclaimed to me or when I read
Scripture?  Do I experience the presence of the Risen Lord Jesus when I gather
with other believers and break bread (either sacramentally and/or in shared
meal)?  Do I sense that Jesus is my “Companion” with Whom I share the Bread of
Life - His Body? Am I willing to reach out a caring hand so that GOD’s curing
hand can touch those who need a sense of GOD’s presence in their lives? To whom
can I extend a caring hand today, and with whom can I share the GOoD News so
that his/her heart can burn within him/her as that person senses GOD’s presence
in Word and action and has Jesus as his/her “Companion”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You desire that all people come to salus – salvation, healing, and a
close relationship with You.  You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to proclaim the
GOoD News of Your healing love.  He continues to reveal His risen presence
especially as we open up Your Word and reflect on it and also come to be nourished
at the table with the Lord Jesus.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit,
continue to enkindle our hearts with the fire of Your love, so that they will
burn with joy as we hear Your Word and feast on the Bread of Life – the Body of
Your Son.  Help us to develop the ministry of care for others so that You can
bring Your Cure – Your Salus (healing, wholeness, holiness, salvation) – to
those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who need it the most.  We pray in the name of Jesus, our
Risen Lord, our Savior and Brother, our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Companion,” Who comes to us in Word and Sacrament and Who
is alive and living with You and the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>Easter Thursday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Fidelis of Sigmaringen:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-fidelis-of-sigmaringen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 3: 11-26;          Psalm 8: 2ab and 5, 6-7,
8-9;           Luke 24: 35-48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings are a continuation of yesterday’s
readings.  After Peter and John healed the crippled man, all three go into the
temple.  The people are amazed at the restoration to health (salus) of the
crippled man. Peter explains that they should not be amazed for GOD promised</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>complete restoration of the Chosen People and has begun to
bring that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>about in and through Jesus, Who is now Risen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm 8 proclaims the gloriousness of GOD and GOD’s choosing
to bless humanity with special favor by lifting up humans to a place of honor
above the rest of creation.  GOD has taken a liking to humanity and desires to
be in special relationship with men and women.  The fitting response is to
praise the name of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel picks up from where yesterday’s Gospel ended.  As
the two disciples from Emmaus finish speaking about their encounter with the
Risen Lord and their recognizing Him in the breaking of the bread, Jesus
appears to all the faithful gathered together on that first Easter Sunday
evening. Jesus speaks the Easter proclamation in one word:  Shalom! He manifests
to them that He is not a ghost by showing them His marks of crucifixion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and eating food.  He then continues His ministry by
explaining that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>everything has happened according to GOD’s plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the scripture passages today speak of GOD’s relationship
with people.  It has always been GOD’s plan to have women and men relate in a
special way with the GODhead.  This special bond was promised to Abraham and
his descendants and proclaimed by Moses and all the prophets, as Peter preaches
in the First Reading today.  It reaches its fulfillment in and through Jesus,
the Messiah.  And even though some of GOD’s Chosen People rejected Jesus and
crucified Him, it still worked into GOD’s overall “Big Picture.”  For it is
through Jesus’ death – and resurrection – that GOD has blessed the people and
restored them to salus (health, holiness, wholeness, and salvation).  The
healing of the lame man is just a sign of the restoration being brought about
in the name of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter did not cure the man; Peter was the means through whom
Jesus brought salus (healing and restoration of health).  This healing is just
a sign of the salus – full healing of mind and body and soul – that GOD wants
for the new Chosen People in and through Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus speaks a similar message on Easter Sunday evening.  He
announces Shalom - peace.  Shalom is much more than mere absence of
contention.  Shalom speaks of a bond of closeness, a reconciliation between two</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sides.  The disciples were fearful that the One Who is now
appearing is a ghost who has come back to haunt them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for their desertion of Him on the past Friday (GOoD
Friday).  They had run away and hid and, in Peter’s case, had denied the
relationship with Jesus.  Jesus could start His Easter appearance with words
such as, “I want to talk to you about your behavior last Thursday night and
Friday.”  His first word, however, is “Shalom.”  He speaks of GOD’s desire that
they be reconciled. [Cilia – means “eyelash” and thus reconciled means to be
brought to a position of being able to look eyelash to eyelash with the One
Whom they had deserted.]  Jesus relates that all that has happened is according
to GOD’s plan.  He had told His disciples beforehand that He would have to
suffer and die in order to bring about reconciliation.  Jesus had to go through
all this so that people would turn away from the sins and turn more fully to
the GOD Who loves them and wants to re-establish the close bond of relationship
with  them.  Jesus did all that He did to bring salus to GOD’s Chosen People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder on all these readings, I am awestruck.  GOD
desires a relationship with us that raises us up to a life beyond our
imagining.  GOD desires us to be perfectly whole, perfectly healed, perfectly
saved.  Obviously, since we are not perfect, and never will be, we cannot do it
ourselves.  Jesus, being perfectly divine and perfectly human, has already done
it.  He has given us salus.  His actions proclaim shalom to us.  We are
reconciled, we are made whole, we are in perfect relationship with GOD as far
as GOD is concerned.  On our part, we need to respond to Jesus’ saving
actions.  We need to acknowledge what Jesus has done for us.  We need to live
lives that reflect the perfect salus that Jesus has given us in and through His
death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our response comes from the last words of today’s Gospel. 
We are witnesses of Jesus’ saving acts.  As</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>witnesses, as people who have experienced the salus and
shalom that Jesus imparted to us through His death and resurrection, we are
called to go out to all peoples and proclaim the GOoD News of reconciliation,
restored relationship, salus, and shalom.  GOD has raised us up to a level
above all creation (Responsorial), not because</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of what we have done.  On the contrary, in spite of what we
have done, GOD has lifted us to a place of honor,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because of what Jesus has done.  Jesus has canceled out the
harm we have done by our sinfulness.  We are resurrected to a new life of
perfect relationship with an Abba-Father Who is GOD.  All because Our Abba, Who
is GOD, loves us beyond our reasoning and comprehension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us respond by continuing to give witness to this loving
GOD Who has raised us up by raising the Son of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  Let people come to know this loving GOD Who raises up
and cures and reconciles by our being Easter people who live lives of shalom
through our caring for others.  This is how we show we have accepted the Easter
gift of the Shalom of the Risen Lord Jesus.  Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   As I reflect on
the Risen Lord’s message of Shalom, what thoughts go through my mind?  Am I
like the disciples coming back from Emmaus who have experienced the Lord Jesus
and want to give witness to a relationship with Him? Am I like the apostles who
are fearfully apprehensive about the presence of the Lord Jesus, doubting if He
could truly be with us after our sinful actions? How can I share the experience
of the Shalom of the Risen Lord with those whom I meet today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all-powerful and completely
perfect.  Through Your GOoDness, You have desired to have a relationship with
us even though we have turned our backs to You and we have chosen to pursue our
own paths.  You constantly have sent spokespersons (prophets) to us, but we
have failed to hear Your message of reconciliation and loving relationship.  We
have done nothing to deserve Your continued outpouring of love.  You want us to
be perfectly whole and united with You.  In our imperfect beings, we can never
attain</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the perfection without Your help.  You, therefore, sent Your
Son Who was perfectly One with You, and perfectly human like us.  He announced
the GOoD News of Your love and brought about a restored relationship with You
through His perfect obedience to Your will.  After He had given up His life for
our salus, You raised Him up as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a sign of Your desire to raise us up to renewed union with
You.  Open up our hearts and our minds to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>awesome message Your Son has proclaimed by His ministry, His
death, and His resurrection.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, continue to
inflame our hearts with Your love so we can go out as witnesses of Your GOoD
News and help others come to a fuller experience of Your gift of Shalom as
announced by the Risen Jesus.  For it is in His name, we make this prayer.  For
Jesus is our Life and our Resurrection, He is the reason we are raised up.  He
is our Savior and Redeemer, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Easter Friday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Readings:  Acts 4: 1-12;        Psalm 118: 1-2, 4, 22-24,
25-27;         John 21: 1-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reading from the Acts of the Apostles continues the
story of what happens to St. Peter and St. John after they healed the lame man
by the power of the Name of Jesus.  Today we hear how they are arrested and are
made to answer the religious leadership concerning the healing that was done to
the lame man.  What upset the Sadducees was Peter’s and John’s proclamation of
Jesus’ resurrection.  The Sadducees did not believe in any life after death. 
[It is “sad, you see,” that the Sadducees did not believe in eternal life –
that’s how I remember their title and corresponding belief.]  After a night in
jail, Peter and John are brought before all the Jewish religious leaders.  They
are challenged to give credentials or some sort of sign of authority that
enables them to heal and preach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the passage, St. Peter is once again filled
with the Holy Spirit and speaks to the assembled body of leaders.  He proclaims
that his credential is the Name of Jesus that he bears.  It is the Name of
Jesus that empowers him and brings salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) to the
people.  (Yeshua [the Hebrew form of Jesus] means “GOD saves” or “GOD’s
salvation” or “GOD the giver of salus.”)  It is Jesus Who has healed the
crippled man.  It is Jesus Who brings salvation.  It is the same Jesus Whom the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>religious leaders had crucified, but Who is raised from the
dead and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continues to live eternally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter goes on to quote part of Psalm 118 (our Responsorial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm today).  In the psalm GOD is praised for the divine
mercy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that endures forever.  Part of the plan of the eternally
merciful GOD is that GOD will take what mortals have rejected and will take the
One Who was rejected and turn the Rejected One into the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cornerstone of the House of GOD.  This is exactly what
happened in Jesus’ death and what continues to happen to the Risen Lord.  Jesus
is the salvation for all who are part of the Household of GOD.  And today –
this Day of Resurrection - is the day that the LORD has made, this is the
reason that we should be glad and rejoice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Gospel presents another account of Jesus’ appearances to
His disciples after His resurrection.  During the forty days after Jesus’
rising from the dead, He only appeared occasionally to His disciples.  Jesus
did not spend all the time with the disciples.  He appeared a number of times
to different people in different circumstances. Today’s account takes place at
the Sea of Tiberias (Sea of Galilee).  The disciples are waiting for another
appearance of their Risen Lord.  Since they have time on their hands, they
decide to spend the night fishing.  The spring night is warm, and they have
nothing better to do, so they set out to sea.  After fishing all night (the
best time to fish), they catch nothing.  They approach the shore and see a Man
tending a fire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As is usual among fishers even to this day, the Man on shore
asks how they did with their fishing.  They reply that they have caught
nothing.  The Man tells them to lower their nets in the shallow waters (not
where fish are usually found especially on warm spring days), and they catch a
net full of fish.  The “disciple Jesus loves” (John?) figures out that the Man
must be Jesus.  Peter, with his usual exuberance, puts on some clothes (he had
been stripped down because of the warm night and fishing).  With all his
clothes on, Peter jumps into water and walks through the shallow water (not on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the water) , in order to be with Jesus.  He forgets about
the others in the boat with the net full of fish.  It is only after Jesus asks
for more fish that Peter remembers about the fish.  He goes out to the boat and
hauls in the big catch all by himself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings today show us the transformation that Peter
goes through, not just because of the Resurrection of Jesus, but also because
of the coming of the Holy Spirit, Who enlightens and gives wisdom and courage
to Peter.  Peter, even after the Resurrection of Jesus, seems to be a bit
scatter-brained.  He cannot stay focused on the full meaning of Jesus’
ministry, His death, and His resurrection.  He doesn’t know what to do, so he
goes fishing.  When Jesus appears, Peter does not think about others or their load
of fish.  Peter puts on his clothes and jumps into the water to get to Jesus. 
He then tries to do what Jesus asks, without asking for help from the other
disciples.  He wants to be the one who brings in the load of fish, about which
he recently has forgotten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Peter in the Acts of the Apostles is different.  He is
in-spired (the Spirit is in him – breathed into him, he has the Holy Spirit
filling his heart and mind).  He is enthusiastic in a GOoD sense, since GOD is
in him, and he is in GOD (en theu).  He is focused on the ministry that he is
called to perform in the Name of Jesus.  He is willing to stand up and face the
religious leaders and to tell them “Jesus saves.”  Peter has a new
understanding of his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>role in living out the call that Jesus gives him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I have reflected on the resurrection accounts, I have
always wondered why Jesus only appears a few times over the course of forty
days between His resurrection and His ascension.  Also, I have pondered why
Jesus only remains for forty days after His resurrection.  I think the reason
may be that He wants His disciples to start thinking about how they are going
to continue His ministry.  He also wants to prepare them for the gifts of the
Holy Spirit, that they cannot fully receive and appreciate while Jesus is still
with them.  They would not be able to focus on the gifts of the Spirit and
their role in ministry while Jesus is around.  He is their focus.  He is the
One Who, they think, should be doing the ministry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that I have been like Peter many times.  I get
excited with my experience of the Risen Lord, then I am not sure what I am
supposed to do next.  I have another experience, so I lose my focus of what I
should be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doing.  It is only when I ask for the continued outpouring
of the Holy Spirit that I can stay focused on the task that Jesus is asking me
to do.  I need to look beyond myself and my experiences and look at those to
whom Jesus is calling me to minister.  It is only when I am aware that the Holy
Spirit has filled me, breathed into me, that I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can go out and proclaim in action the GOoD News of Jesus,
the Risen Savior.  It is then that I can do whatever I am called to do in the
Name of the Lord Jesus.  It is only when I focus on giving praise to the Name
of Jesus that I can serve others fully and completely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I see myself
like Peter? Am I focused more on my own immediate experiences without seeing
the whole picture?  How have I allowed myself to be inspired (to have the Holy
Spirit breathe into me)? Do I do all that I do in the Name of the Lord Jesus? 
To whom am I being sent to proclaim that “Jesus saves”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, overflowing in mercy and wisdom. 
Through Your GOoDness and through Your Son and His call of Peter, You have
given us an example of a person with whom we can resonate.  The choice of Peter
as a leader-in-training enables us to see that not one of us is perfect.  In
fact, You often choose those who are the furthest from being perfect.  You want
to be able to receive all the glory and honor that is due You for bringing out
Your message from our weakness.  Continue to fill us with the Holy Spirit in
the same way that You filled Peter.  Help us to grow through our experiences of
the Risen Lord so that we can become Your servants in proclaiming Your GOoD
News.  May our actions reflect Your love.  May we care for others so You can
bring Your salus to Your People whom You have made holy.  Give us the wisdom
and courage to stand up and show that what we do for others is in the Name of
the Lord Jesus.  We make this prayer through the same Jesus, Your Son, our
Lord, our Risen Savior and loving Brother, Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!

<p class=MsoNormal>April 26, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Easter Saturday </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Pedro de San Jose Betancur:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 4: 13-21;         Psalm 118:  1, 14-15,
16-18, 19-21;            Mark 16: 9-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reading from the Acts of the Apostles relates the
response of the religious authority to St. Peter’s bold proclamation in
yesterday’s reading.  The leaders do not know what to do with Peter and John. 
If they punish the apostles, the people will be upset, because many have come
to believe in the Name of Jesus through the actions and words of the apostles. 
If they condone what the apostles are doing, then the people will ask why the
religious leaders do not believe.  They decide to give a strong warning to the
apostles not to preach any more or even mention “that Name.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, Psalm 118 continues from yesterday also.  In today’s
passage we hear that “the LORD is my savior and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that I shall not die, but live and declare the works of the
LORD.”  Today’s passage ends with “I will give thanks to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You, for You have answered me and have been my savior.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today is Mark’s brief account of Easter Sunday
resurrection appearances.  We hear how Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene and to
the two disciples on their journey to the country town of Emmaus (where Jesus
is recognized in breaking bread).  When the Eleven (the 12 apostles minus
Judas) hear about these appearances, they do not believe Mary or the two
disciples.  It is only when Jesus appears to the Eleven that they believe.  In
this Gospel we hear about Jesus “taking them to task” or “rebuking them,” not
for their desertion of Him a few days ago, but “for their disbelief.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, we see a contrast between the Apostles on Easter
Sunday and after the coming of the Holy Spirit (fifty days after Easter).  The
disbelief of the apostles on Easter Sunday comes from their experience of the
death of Jesus.  The death of Jesus is so overpowering that the apostles find
it hard to believe that Jesus is alive.  Jesus’ passion and excruciating death
are so terrible for them to even think about it; thus, it is impossible for
them to imagine that Jesus is alive.  Besides, things would be different if He
is alive.  They have denied their relationship with Him, or at least have
deserted Him in His hour of sorrow and pain.  How can they still relate to Him
if He is alive?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jesus appears, He chastises them not for their denial
and desertion, but for their not believing Mary and the two disciples who have
experienced His Risen presence.   He then “apostles” them – sends them out on
the mission of spreading the GOoD News.  He commissions them – “sends them with
a purpose” – to continue His ministry.  In the verses following today’s
excerpt, Mark has Jesus telling His apostles to baptize believers and give
warnings to those who do not believe.  Jesus promises that His apostles (those
whom Jesus “sends” to continue His ministry) will be able to do great things in
His Name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“In the Name of Jesus” is a key phrase today for me.  It is
in the Name of Jesus that Peter and John speak the healing words to the
crippled man in the readings we read earlier this week.  In Peter’s speech
before the religious leaders, which we heard on Thursday, Peter says:  “It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is His Name and trust in this Name” that caused the man to
be healed.  In today’s reading from the Acts of the Apostles, the religious
leaders avoid mentioning the Name, they say “that Name” or “this Name.”  They,
too, realized that there was power in the Name of Jesus, so they did not want
to mention Jesus’ Name.  They decide to give the apostles “a stern warning
never to mention that Man’s Name to anyone again.”  Peter and John respond by
saying they cannot disobey GOD’s command.  They</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have to continue to spread the Name of Jesus and do great
things in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Name of Jesus.  That is what Jesus has commanded them to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I think about my faith in the
Risen Lord and my belief in the power of the Name of Jesus.  It is easy for us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christian, who live 2000 years after Jesus, to say “I
believe in the Resurrection of Jesus.”  This is partly because </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we might not have fully been impacted by the death of Jesus
in the same way that the disciples of Jesus were when they, from a distance,
saw Him die on the cross.  Also, we have a fuller view of the whole paschal
mystery</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– Jesus’ life, suffering, death,  and resurrection.  We know
how the story turns out because we have heard the ending before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge for me is this:  Have I experienced the
presence of the Risen Lord? Is my belief based on a relationship with Jesus,
not just head knowledge about His resurrection? The apostles, in today’s
Gospel, find it hard to believe because they have had a relationship with Jesus
and have experienced His death, if even only from a distance.  They have felt
an emptiness, a death in a relationship.  It will take seeing the Risen Lord to
fill in the emptiness and let them experience the relationship again. 
Sometimes, I know I take my belief for granted.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>don’t realize the relationship that I am called to have with
Jesus.  The more I grow in relationship with Jesus, the more the resurrection
makes sense – the more I can experience the Risen Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet I need to take the next step.  I need to be “apostled” –
to be sent out in the Name of Jesus – to announce GOoD News in the Name of
Jesus – to minister and invoke the Name of Jesus, so He can reach out and bring
salus (wholeness, healing, salvation) to those who need it.  Yet how much do I
use the Name of Jesus in the way GOD intends.  (I know a lot of people who use
the Name of Jesus, but not in the way GOD intends.)  Because I am a believer, a
member of the Body of Christ, I am called to serve others in the Name of
Jesus.  I need to minister to their needs and share the GOoD News that comes in
the Name of Jesus.  People need to know that I do not come in my own name or
for my own glory, I come for the glory of the Name of Jesus.  People should
come to know Jesus through my caring for them.  They should</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience the Risen Lord Jesus in my reaching out to them
in the Name of Jesus.  That’s what the readings say to me.  That’s what it is
all about – the Name of Jesus – “GOD saves” – “GOD, the One who brings salus –
wholeness, healing, salvation.”   Let us lovingly, frequently, and powerfully
proclaim the Name of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What does it mean
to me to do all things “in the Name of Jesus”? How have I experienced the Risen
Lord in my life? How can I share the GOoD News of Jesus today?  What can I do
to remind people that they are loved by GOD in the Name of Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever caring and always healing. 
Through Your GOoDness, You sent Your Son to us.  You decreed that His Name is
Jesus – “GOD saves.”  He proclaimed the GOoD News of Your love and Your desire
for a renewed relationship to all who would believe in Him.  He gave witness to
that close relationship by His life, teaching – His suffering, death, and
resurrection.  He shared His power and mission with His disciples and gave
proof of His continued relationship with them after His death by appearing to
them in His glorified, risen state.  Jesus commissioned His followers to carry
on His mission and ministry, and He empowered them to spread the GOoD News
through their ministering in His Name.  We thank You for all who have
proclaimed the Gospel to us, in the Name of Jesus.  We also praise You for
allowing us to share in the ministry of sharing the GOoD News of the Name of
Jesus.  Through the further outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, continue to inflame
within us the desire to serve others in the Name of Jesus.  We make this prayer
in the Name of Jesus – “GOD saves” – Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and
Redeemer, our Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Second Sunday of Easter - Divine Mercy Sunday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Louis Mary Grignion de Montfort:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 5: 12-16;                       Psalm 118:
2-4, 13-15, 22-24; Revelation 1: 9-11a, 12-13, 17-19;        John 20: 19-31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we continue our celebration of Easter. Our Gospel
relates the events of both Easter Sunday and the Sunday after it. In the
thought process of the Church, today is still Easter Sunday since this majestic
feast cannot be celebrated in only one day. The readings speak of the response
of those who experience the Risen Lord Jesus. They are changed individuals who are
on a mission, being sent – “apostled” – to continue the ministry of the Risen
Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading describes the enthusiastic ministry of the
apostles on the days after they have received the Holy Spirit on Pentecost.
They are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>truly on a mission – to proclaim the GOoD News that Jesus
has died, but He is risen. As part of their inspired mission, they welcome new
believers and allow the Lord Jesus to heal those upon whom their shadows fall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm 118 is used frequently during the Easter Season since
it is a joyful hymn of praise and thanksgiving to GOD, recalling the key
attributes of GOD: enduring and perpetual mercy. It also refers to the rock
rejected by the builders that becomes the cornerstone, alluding to Jesus’ death
and resurrection, that become the foundation of the new edifice of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Reading gives us a sense of what John (the author
of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Book of Revelation) sees as his mission. Because of his
continued awareness of the Risen Lord Jesus, he is called to proclaim his
vision, to be aware of what is happening in the seven churches (communities of
faith), and to look forward to what will happen. His relationship with the
Risen Lord implies his need to be vigilant and concerned for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>communities of faith that are entrusted to him, even though
he is on the penal island of Patmos in the Mediterranean Sea. His apostolic
duties require that he minister to (challenge and encourage) the growing (both
positively and negatively) churches. He is to make sure that they stay focused
on the Truth that/Who has been shared with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel spans the eight days from the Easter Sunday to
the following Sunday. Jesus appears to His disciples and greets them with the
message of Shalom. Shalom (peace) is His Easter gift to His followers. His
death and resurrection were the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>means of the divine Shalom being bestowed on them. Shalom is
much more than the absence of tension and stress. It is the
establishment/re-establishment of the relationship that was broken through sin.
With Shalom comes the gift of the Holy Spirit and the gift of forgiveness of
sins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the other ten apostles relate to Thomas their
experience of the Risen Jesus, he demands physical proof. A week later, he is
given the proof he demands when Jesus appears again and invites Thomas</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to come and explore the nail holes and pierced side. Thomas
proclaims his belief in Jesus as GOD. The Gospel passage concludes with the
first ending of John’s Gospel, the proclamation that this book does not contain
all the mighty signs that Jesus did, but it includes enough so that those who
read it may come to a (deeper) belief that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of GOD
and the source of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on readings, I realize Easter cannot be just a
day of joyful celebrating with rich and tasty foods. It is not just a day of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>eating candy or other pleasurable treats we have denied
ourselves for the preceding 40 days. It is not just a day when we remember that
Jesus not only died but also rose again. It is an event that cannot be captured
in just one day. It must be celebrated and made part of our daily lives, day
after day, week after week, year after year. And the celebration must not just
be a recalling of what has taken place, but also it must lead to our active
response in our daily activities. Easter must be alive within us as we go out
on our mission. We, like the apostles in the readings, are being sent out to
proclaim the Easter message that Jesus has died, but that He is risen and
active among us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of us may still act like Thomas during the first seven
days of Easter. We are not fully convinced that Jesus is alive and that it
makes a difference in our lives. Oh, we can say, “Jesus had died, Jesus is
risen.” Yet, we act like we are not fully assured of His presence in our
personal life. We may be happy that others are experiencing the Risen Lord, but
He really hasn’t touched our lives in a visible way because we were not there
when the others had the Lord Jesus make His presence known to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ words on the Second Sunday of Easter should bolster our
faith: “Blessed are those who have not seen but have believed.” We must act
with faith. We must fulfill our apostolic mission to go out and live the GOoD
News that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has died and is risen. We must be people of Shalom –
announcing the message that Jesus continues to manifest</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– the healed relationship between GOD and mortals which He
established through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is also called “Divine Mercy Sunday.” Mercy in Hebrew
is rachamim. It refers to the quality a woman has for the child in her womb or
for the child who came from her womb. Jesus and GOD the Abba-Father has even
more love and mercy (rachamim) for each of us, since we are children of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are to be the apostles of the Risen Lord to the people
with whom we come in contact each and every day. People must experience the
presence of the Lord Jesus as we touch their lives. We must live out our
baptismal calling to preach the GOoD News to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can do this by being instruments of GOD’s Shalom. That
may involve speaking challenging words of truth (as John does in the Book of
Revelation), but always in the love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the Lord Jesus. We must seek to further the Shalom that
Jesus created through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we can do this, we may become other stones rejected by
some builders, but we will be joined to the cornerstone of Jesus. We will
experience the enthusiasm that comes from knowing that we are making every day
a celebration of Easter Shalom. We will be able to say and experience each day,
the verse in today’s Responsorial: “This is the day that the LORD has made. Let
us be glad and rejoice in it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How is my life a
proclamation that Jesus is risen and has shared with us the gift of Shalom? Do
I constantly need some sort of “proof” of the Risen Lord, or can I believe
without “seeing”? Who might benefit from my sharing the gift of Easter Shalom –
peace and reconciliation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of Shalom and Divine Mercy.
Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son to us to establish Shalom through
His death and resurrection. He came not to scold us for our sinfulness, but to
raise us to a new consciousness of what life is meant to be as we turn away
from our sinfulness and turn to You. His resurrection bestowed Your Holy Spirit
upon His disciples, not just on that first Easter Sunday or on Pentecost, but
upon all of His followers ever since. Because of our experience of His risen
presence in our lives, we, too, are called to go out and proclaim His message as
apostles to the people You have entrusted to us. We thank You for allowing us
to grow in our faith in the GOoD News that Jesus, Your Son, has announced to
us. May we be faithful to our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>calling as modern apostles and may we proclaim the Shalom
that Jesus brought to us. For our lack of faith and our sinfulness, we seek
Your forgiveness and a new sense of the divine Shalom and Divine Mercy. As
always, we give You thanks and praise on this Easter day, in and through Your
Son, Jesus, our Redeemer and Risen Lord, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of the Second Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Martin I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 4: 23-31;       Psalm 2: 1-3, 4-7a,
7b-9;        John 3: 1-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy Spirit makes things happen.  Even when mortals plot
against GOD and GOD’s will, the Spirit of GOD empowers those who are faithful
so that they can fulfill GOD’s plan.  Saints Peter and John are aware of this
as they return from being questioned and rebuked by the Jewish religious
leaders.  The psalmist is aware also that even though some are working against
GOD and the Anointed One of GOD, GOD will raise up the Anointed One to even
greater glory.  In the Gospel, Jesus also speaks about the power of the Holy
Spirit Who enables one to be born from above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading, after their time before the religious
leaders, Saints Peter and John rejoice that they were able to boldly profess
the Name of Jesus.  Peter then quotes Psalm 2 which speaks of plots against GOD
and GOD’s Chosen Anointed One (Messiah = Christ).  Peter interprets this psalm
in reference to Jesus and His disciples.  As they conclude their prayer, the
powerful manifestation of the Holy Spirit once again comes upon the disciples
gathered in prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm that Peter quoted is used as the Responsorial.  We
hear how plots are being made against GOD and the Anointed One of GOD.  The
powers of evil, however, cannot overcome GOD’s plan.  GOD will establish “the
Son” as the ruler and king, in spite of plans of the wicked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Nicodemus (one of the religious leaders, a
Pharisee) comes to Jesus at night.  Nicodemus recognizes the holiness and
specialness of Jesus, that is, that Jesus is from GOD.  Jesus then speaks about
the importance of being born ἄνωθεν (anothen), if one wants to be part of the
Reign of GOD.  The word ἄνωθεν (anothen) has two meanings:  1) “from above” and
2) “again.”  Jesus takes it to mean the first, whereas Nicodemus interprets to
be the second.  Jesus clarifies Nicodemus’ misunderstanding by saying that it
is necessary to be born “from above,” that is, by water and the Spirit.  When
one is born spiritually, (by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit), one is
empowered by the Πνεμα (Pneuma = Spirit) and great things happen.  Once again,
a play on words is used.  The Greek word Πνεμα (Pneuma) is similar in meaning
to the Hebrew word Ruah.  It can mean “spirit,” “wind,” or “breath.”  It is that
unseen Force or Power Which/Who can cause dramatic results.  When people have
the Spirit of GOD blowing into, and through, them, they are energized to do
GOD’s will with the Force and Power of GOD.  People can not see the Spirit
(Ruah - Πνεμα (Pneuma), but the can see the effects caused by the Spirit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded today as I reflect on the readings that the
Church is in the midst of celebrating the Paschal Mysteries.  These mysteries
include Jesus’ death and resurrection, His ascension into heaven, and the
sending of the Holy Spirit upon His disciples.  Belief in Jesus, the Anointed
One (the Messiah, the Christ) requires us to accept what Jesus has done for us
through His death and resurrection.  Not only has Jesus brought us salus
(healing, wholeness, forgiveness, and salvation), Jesus continues to empower us
by the Holy Spirit to further His GOoD News.  The Holy Spirit was not just
given to the disciples of Jesus in a one-time event (Pentecost).  The Holy
Spirit came upon them frequently (as seen in today’s First Reading).  And the
Holy Spirit continues to come upon the disciples of Jesus today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the time of year when many Catholic churches are
used to celebrating the sacrament of Confirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the rite of Confirmation, the bishop reminds the
young people and adults who are receiving this sacrament of initiation that
this sacrament truly is just an initiation.  For many Catholics, the reception
of the Holy Spirit in Confirmation is thought of as a completion of their
religious education.  Yet the receiving of the Holy Spirit is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not just a one-time event.  And participation in the life of
the faith community does not end with this sacrament of initiation.  This is
the beginning (= initiation), not the end, of the mature Christian’s Church activities. 
The confirmed Christian receives the Holy Spirit so he/she can more fully take
an active role in the community’s activities and spread the faith to which
he/she has recommitted himself/herself.  The Spirit comes again  upon the apostles
and earlier believers in today’s First Reading We who are born ἄνωθεν (anothen
- from above, and again) must allow the Πνεμα  (Pneuma = Spirit) of GOD to
breathe new life into us again and again.  We must let the Spirit blow into and
through us with divine power and force.  We must move out with the power of the
Spirit to continue the announcement of the GOoD News of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am privileged to continue to work with the adults in the
OCIA (formerly called RCIA).  As I talked with those who have been “initiated”
into the faith community by the reception of the sacraments of initiation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Baptism-Confirmation-Eucharist), I am impressed by what
they share.  Since they were received into the Church (the Body of Christ) or
were confirmed in their faith, they have felt the power of the Holy Spirit
acting in their lives.  They sensed a new joy of being part of a community of
faith and supported by the other members of the community.  I recall how a few
years ago on the Second Sunday of Easter one of those who had been baptized spoke
of the most special part of event was her baptism and her being plunged
(baptizo) into the death and resurrection of Jesus.  Another mentioned
receiving the Eucharist for the first time was truly uplifting.  Still another
mentioned she was very touched by members of the community whom she had never
met coming up to her and welcoming her into the community of believers.  Some
years ago, one of the newly confirmed shared how her relationship with the Lord
Jesus and her view of being part of the church had been enhanced through the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Holy Spirit of the Risen Lord is still very active in
the world.  We may not always realize how the Spirit is working in our lives. 
Yet, the more we are aware of our being born ἄνωθεν (anothen - from above), the
more the Πνεμα (Pneuma – Spirit) of GOD can work in us.  And even if those who
are opposed to GOD’s plans</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>work against GOD and us (the disciples of the Lord Jesus),
we must realize that GOD’s Spirit, Who is with us, is more powerful than the
force that is driving those who work against GOD.  And if we allow GOD’s Spirit
to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blow into and through us, we can join the prayer of Peter
and John in today’s First Reading and pray:  “And now, LORD, take note of the
threats, and enable Your servants to speak Your Word with all boldness, as You
stretch forth Your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are done through the
Name of Your holy servant Jesus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:     When have I
experienced the Πνεμα (Pneuma) of GOD (Ruah YHWH - The Spirit of GOD) working
in my life?  Have I been open to being born ἄνωθεν (anothen = from above and
again)? Do I see that I am always at a stage of new beginning and initiation in
my journey of faith?  What can I do to stand up with all boldness and speak
GOD’s Word to others? How can I help others realize the presence of the Holy
Spirit in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and powerful. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have given us a share in Your Spirit (Pneuma and
Ruah) when we have been born ἄνωθεν (anothen = from above and again).  You
continue to empower us to go out in the Name of Your Son, Jesus, and to
proclaim His GOoD News to those with whom we come in contact.  For the times we
have worked contrary to Your plan, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Renew
our awareness of Your Holy Spirit’s presence in our lives.  May we give You all
the glory and praise as we go out in the Name of Your Son Jesus, for He is our
Lord and Savior, our Master-Teacher and Redeemer and He is living and reigning
with You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Catherine of Siena</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Tue. of the 2nd Week of Easter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Catherine of Siena:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-catherine-of-siena</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 4: 32-37;        Psalm 93: 1ab, 1cd-2,
5;          John 3: 7b-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading, from the Acts of the Apostles, relates
how the early Christians lived a communal life and shared their possessions. 
The psalm speaks of the majesty of the LORD GOD, the Ruler Who is robed in
splendor.  The Gospel is part of the account of Jesus’ meeting with the
Nicodemus, a Pharisee who comes to Jesus at night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the selection from the Acts of the Apostles, we see how
the early Christians realize their call to be in relationship not only with
Jesus and His Abba-Father, but also with all their sisters and brothers in
Christ Jesus.  They are to be more of a family under their Abba than blood
relatives are a family.  They are to listen to their “older” Christian
siblings, the Apostles, proclaim the GOoD News and share about their
relationship with their Brother Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These “older” Christian siblings have spent more time with
Jesus than the “younger” ones who are just beginning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their relationship with Jesus.  Then these “younger”
siblings are asked to share all they have with all those who are also children
of their Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to focus on the Gospel and start at the
beginning of the third chapter of St. John’s Gospel (that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we heard yesterday).  If you want to read it, go to this
site:   http://usccb.org/bible/john/3.  The chapter begins with Nicodemus coming
at night.  He does not want to be seen as a person who is interested in talking
to Jesus. Nicodemus comes alone.  He says that Jesus must obviously be a GOoD
teacher (rebbe – rabbi) because He performs signs and wonders.  Nicodemus seeks
to know more about Jesus.  Nicodemus, later in John’s Gospel, is mentioned as
trying to defend Jesus when He is brought before the Jewish leaders, although
he does it in a round- about way (John 7: 45-52).  Finally at the end of John’s
Gospel, Nicodemus more publicly shows his relationship to Jesus by helping to
prepare the dead body of Jesus for burial (John 19: 38-40). [By the way, the
name, Nicodemus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is from two Greek word:  íéêç (nikç) meaning “victory” and
äåìïò (demos) meaning “people” thus “People’s Victory.” An appropriate name for
one who finally is committed to the One Who brings victory to the people.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our earthly (or fleshy) birth puts us in relationship with
GOD as creature to Creator.  It is a gift of GOD.  It is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>something for which we should truly give thanks and praise
to GOD.  We have life because GOD allowed us to be born.  Yet an even deeper
relationship is ours when we are born anothen (“again” or “from above”) by the
Ruah [Hebrew] (Pneuma [Greek] – Spirit) of GOD.  This makes us not just
creatures of a Creator, but children of an Abba – a Father – a Daddy – Who is
GOD.  We are called into a personal relationship with this Abba – Jesus’ Abba,
and thus we become siblings of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus reminds Nicodemus that the gift of the Holy Spirit of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is not something which can be seen or predicted.  It is
pure gift.  It is the gift that comes from the Son of GOD being lifted up. 
Jesus compares it to the salus – healing, life – that came to all the
Israelites who had been bitten by serpents in the desert.  If the Israelites
looked up to the bronze figure of the serpent on the wood, they would be healed
(Numbers 21: 9).  So, Jesus, in today’s Gospel, says that the Son of Man will
be lifted up on the wood.  All who put their faith in the One lifted up on the
wood will have salus – healing, salvation – and not just physical salus, but
eternally spiritual salus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflection leads me to think about the relationship that
GOD offers us.  GOD first gifted us with human </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life.  We can relate to GOD as Creator, the One Who gives
life.  That in and of itself is a beautiful and cherished gift.  Yet, GOD wants
an even closer relationship with us.  GOD wants us to be born anothen (“again”
“from above”), to have the Spirit of GOD (Ruah YHWH) blown into us, into our souls,
and to share with us not only human life, but divine life.  Human life only
entitles us to life on earth, life here and now.  It is limited and not
complete.  Divine life, that which comes from above (anothen - “from above” or
“again”), entitles us to be with an Abba – and endearing Parent – Who is Ruler
of Heaven and Who is GOD.  We are made daughters and sons of GOD and we have
been given the inheritance of our Abba-Daddy, the Ruler, Who is also GOD.  What
a more marvelous gift than just a limited, imperfect human life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And our response is to live as children of the divine Ruler
of Heaven, our Abba-Daddy.  People should be able to look at us and to tell
Whom we call Abba.  There should be no doubt Whose children we are for we act
as our Abba wills, we act like our Brother, Jesus, all because we have been
born “again” and “from on high” by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ruah-Spirit of GOD.  That’s the GOoD News that Jesus is
sharing with Nicodemus and with us.  And that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should lead us to share all things in common, just as the early
followers of Jesus did in today’s First Reading.  We are called to be one, big,
joy-filled family who share all we have with our sisters and brothers, because
we are all children of our Abba GOD, and siblings of the Lord Jesus, in
fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was impressed during the pandemic of the last few years
how the best in some people came out as they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>offered their time, their talents (medical, first
responding, food preparation and serving, other critical and essential
talents), and their treasure (donating to those who need financial help because
of being out of work, or not having money for rent, mortgages, food, and other
essential items).  I have also been blessed as I saw how people all over the
world responded to the Crisis in Ukraine, with people opening their homes to
refugees and sending aid to the Ukranian people.  It reminds me of how the
early Christians shared what they had with others in today’s First Reading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often do I
reflect on, and give thanks for, the earthly, human life that GOD has given me?
When I reflect on the fuller life and more intimate relationship with GOD, the
relationship that has come when I have been open to the Holy Spirit of GOD
(Ruah YHWH), how do I show my appreciation for GOD calling me to be born
(anothen) “from on high” or “again”?  How do I manifest that I am a child of
GOD? Do I only make my interest in GOD known in “the dark” – privately, so no
one else will know?  Do I defend the Lord Jesus, but only in roundabout way? 
Am I willing to publicly manifest my attachment to the Lord Jesus and minister
to the Body of Christ Jesus (the members of His community living on earth) so
they can experience the “victory of GOD’s People”?  Am I willing to share all I
have with others to show my unity with them, under GOD our Abba-Father, with
Jesus, our Brother, in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You desire that we be in relationship with You, first as our Creator,
and also as our loving and dear Father, our Abba.  You gift us first with human
life, and then through the power of Your Holy Spirit, You gift us with a share
in Your divine life.  We are often like Nicodemus.  We are interested in what
You offer us through Your Son.  Yet, we often do not want others to know we are
interested in the GOoD News You offer us.  We come in darkness, so no one will
see us.  You ask us to accept the gift of divine life and be willing to share
that GOoD News with others.  Continue to fill us with Your Spirit – Your Ruah –
Your life-breath, so that we can be strengthened and empowered to spread the
GOoD News of Your loving relationship and share in the “victory for the
people.”  May we always give You thanks and praise for touching our lives in
and through Your Son and the Holy Spirit.  We make this prayer in the name of
Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and Redeemer, Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. 
Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of the Second Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Pius V)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Saint Pius V:     Readings:  Acts 5: 17-26;        Psalm
34: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9;        John 3: 16-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading relates the arrest of some of the
apostles.  Even though they are jailed, GOD releases them. The next morning,
they are back in the temple area preaching about Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reminds us that GOD hears the prayer of those who
call out to the LORD.  GOD brings safety to those who are in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel continues the account of Jesus’ meeting with
Nicodemus.  Today we hear the often-quoted passage of John 3: 16: “GOD so loved
the world that GOD sent the only begotten Son, so that all who believe in the
message of the Son would not die and perish, but would share in eternal life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am struck by a couple of things in the First Reading. 
After being arrested and imprisoned, the apostles completely have trust in GOD.
When released by the messenger (angel) of GOD, they return to the temple
precincts, the same place from which they had been arrested. They do not fear
being arrested again.  Most people, if they are released from jail, do not
return to the place where they were apprehended (in loco delicti) and perform
the same action that led to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their arrest.  The apostles realize that it is GOD’s will
that they preach the GOoD News and continue the ministry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Jesus, especially in the House of GOD, even though that
will most likely lead to their continued arrest and persecution.  They are
happy to be able to face their being apprehended and jailed, if it furthers the
spread of Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second thing that strikes me about the passage is the
fact that the apostles do not put up any resistance nor do they cause a scene
when they are arrested again.  The guards realize that they must proceed
carefully, or the crowds might attack the soldiers.  The apostles could cause
such a disturbance that they would not have been arrested.  Yet, they are
willing to be arrested without a commotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The attitude of the apostles reflects the message in the Gospel
today:  those who do wrong prefer darkness, while</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who do right, will act in the light of day.  Thus, as
the sun rises, the apostles come back into the openness of the temple and
preach the message of Jesus.  They do not fear the agents</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of darkness and deceit, for they know they are in the Light,
walking the Way – they are one with the Son sent by the Abba- Father GOD Who so
loves the world.  They do not fear condemnation by the religious leaders, or by
anyone, for they know they have eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I look at my own life, I realize that I am not as bold in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my faith as the apostles were in their faith.  I often couch
my words so as not to cause others to be alarmed by my beliefs.  I am not
always willing to walk fully in the Light.  I keep my faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>close to my chest.  I am challenged by the readings today to
take a step of faith.  I must be willing to risk persecution and mistreatment
for my relationship with Jesus.  I guess at times I am more like the apostles
before the coming of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost.  Yes, I believe and have a
relationship with Jesus and His Abba- Father, but I would rather it be a more private
relationship without a lot of attention.  If it ever came down to my being
arrested for my belief, I am not sure that I would be able to handle the test. 
And if I was released, I am not  positive I would be back at the place of my
previous apprehension the next morning, continuing the very actions that caused
me to be arrested the first time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two things happened a while ago that reinforced my
reflection.  I was attaining my usual Tuesday morning Bible Study.  An issue
came up.  I was reluctant to share where I stood on a particular Biblical view
and take a stand.  Another one of the participants was willing to challenge the
group from his perspective of the Gospel.  I then had the courage to speak up
and share my interpretation of the Gospel value.  It took someone else’s
stepping out in faith to present their understanding of the Gospel in order for
me to speak up and share a similar understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second thing that happened was what I heard on a
Christian radio station.  The host of the show was speaking about people
suffering for their Christian faith.  The speaker went on to say, “It is
interesting that some Moslem believers are willing to die for a ‘lie’ [the
Moslem misunderstanding of life and GOD as seen by the speaker], while many
Christians are not willing to die for the Truth.”  Some people may think that
commentary is a harsh criticism of the Muslim faith and an intolerant stand. 
The point I think the speaker was making is:  as Christians, we must be willing
to stand up for what (Whom) we believe and know to be the Truth.  And there are
Christians in the Middle East who are standing up for their faith and willing
to undergo persecution for our common faith in Jesus.  I recall hearing
recently that in the 21st Century, 1 out of every 12 Christians is being
challenged in their faith moderately or severely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I guess I have a lot of growing in my faith yet to do.  I
take heart from knowing that Peter and the other apostles took some time and a
further outpouring of the Holy Spirit to give them enough courage to risk it
all for the Name of the Lord Jesus.  Maybe there is still hope for me.  I know
I have come a long way, but there is still a lot farther I must travel in my
journey of faith.  With GOD’s help, I pray that I will be able to stand up for
the Lord Jesus when it comes down to the real test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us continue to pray for each other.  Let us pray that we
will be able to take a stand and boldly proclaim our relationship with GOD. 
With GOD’s help, and the support of our fellow believers, we will be faithful
disciples of our Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I
manifested my faith in the Risen Lord Jesus?  Do I secretly profess my faith
when no one else is around?  Am I willing to come into the Light and boldly share
my relationship with Jesus, trusting that GOD will take care of me? How can I
inspire others to be bolder in their faith?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the One Who so loves the world
that You send Your only begotten Son into the world that those of us who live
out our belief in You and Your Son, Jesus, will have eternal life.  Through
Your GOoDness, You continue to manifest Your love for us through our reflection
on the words, life, and ministry of Your Son, Jesus.  We are bolstered also by
the examples of the apostles.  As we see their earlier lack of faith and
conviction blossom into boldness, through the power of Your Holy Spirit, we are
given hope and encouragement that we too will become strong proclaimers of Your
GOoD News.  Continue to send forth Your Holy Spirit into our lives so that we
can be faithful witnesses, not only in words and thoughts, but also in the
actions of our daily existence.  We give all the glory, praise, and honor to
You, together with Your Son, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. And we make this
prayer in the Name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and Redeemer,
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of the Fourth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Pius V)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Pius V</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 13: 13-25;       Psalm 89: 2-3, 21-22, 25
and 27;        John 13: 16-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings remind us that Jesus is the pivotal point in
history.  Jesus came as the fulfillment of all the Hebrews scriptures, and He
is the beginning of all that lies in store for us.  We also reflect on the fact
that Jesus was sent by His Abba-Father and He, in turn, sends out others to continue
His mission/apostolate of announcing the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s account from the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul
is on his missionary journey.  He addresses a crowd of Jews and “GOD-fearing”
individuals (non-Jews who have come to the synagogue to learn more about GOD
and who desire to have a relationship with GOD).  Paul asserts that all of
Israelite history has been leading up to the coming of Jesus, the Christ,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the savior of the world.  [John is John Mark, traditional
understood to be the author of the Gospel of Mark.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes part of Paul’s words in the First Reading. 
(Actually, Paul was quoting part of this psalm.)  The psalmist praises GOD for
choosing David and giving David power to lead the people, all for the greater
glory of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, that takes place on the night before Jesus
dies, Jesus reminds His disciples that He has come as the Master Who serves. 
Just as Jesus has washed the feet of His followers, so they must be willing to
serve others.  Jesus also creates a link between His followers and Himself that
parallels the link Jesus has with His Abba.  The concept of being sent
(“apostled”) flows from Jesus’ own sense of mission/being sent by His Abba.  It
is a continued tradition (“handing down”) of authority.  Jesus has been fully
empowered by GOD, His Abba, and now Jesus empowers His disciples to be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>apostles (“those who are sent”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am edified and uplifted by the readings today.  I see that
each one of us, as the modern disciples of Jesus, are part of the salvific plan
of GOD.  GOD has control over history.  The Hebrew scriptures prepared the
world for the coming of Jesus, the Savior Who is the Christ - the Anointed One
of GOD.  The Word of GOD, as spoken through the patriarchs and prophets,
focused on the time when GOD would save the people.  (Remember Jesus [Yeshua]
means “GOD saves.”)  GOD’s plan was to send the Son with the mission and the
ministry of announcing salvation and bringing it about through His own death
and resurrection.  The plan has not been limited only to the thirty-something
years that Jesus walked on this earth in His human body.  It reaches out from
that key moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plan includes sharing the mission and ministry by
“apostling” (sending out) others to continue the proclamation of the divine
message of salvation.  We are doubly privileged.  Not only have we heard the
message through the human voices of those who came before us in faith, but we
are also being given the opportunity to announce the same message to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main way we are called to preach the GOoD News is
addressed in today’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel.  We are called to be servants, just as Jesus
served.  We are called to be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>willing to “wash the feet” of others.  This “washing of the
feet” can take many forms.  It can be our unconditional love for our family
demonstrated by our doing our regular routine tasks with a cheerful heart.  It
can be the way we treat those with whom we work (or have worked in the past). 
It can be, as I have learned from the experiences of the last three decades,
the caring for a sick and/or aged person who needs our help.  We can “serve
others” by simply smiling at a person whom we encounter in our daily
activities, including associating with others via social media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever we are willing to think of others before ourselves,
(while not letting ourselves be walked on or run over), it is then that we are
imitating our Master Who came to serve and not to be served.  From our serving
others and sharing the GOoD News with them (first in actions), people should be
able to see our relationship with our Master, just as Jesus revealed His
relationship with His Abba by His acts of loving service and His words.  If we
can do that, then the words of today’s psalm will resonate through our very
being:  “The favors of the LORD I will sing forever; through all generations my
mouth shall proclaim Your faithfulness.  For You have said, ‘My kindness is
established forever’;  in heaven You have confirmed Your faithfulness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What will I do
today to demonstrate that I am a servant of the Lord Jesus as I interact with
those whom I encounter?  How can I be more of a loving servant with a
particular member of my family, a specific co-worker, or a person who crosses
my path today (even if it is only online)?  What can I do to encourage others
to proclaim the GOoD News by the way they serve the people around them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have always wanted to share Yourself with mortals, whom You made
in Your own image and likeness.  We have not always understood Your willingness
to care for us, even though You have proclaimed Your message through the
prophets of old.  In the fulness of Your time, You sent Your Son as the
Incarnation of Your loving service.  Jesus came as the Master Who serves and
saves.  Jesus has empowered those who accept His gift of salvation to be
co-workers with Him in the process of proclaiming Your love.  We thank You for
those who answered the call and shared with us Your GOoD News.  We also are grateful
for Your allowing us to be a part of furthering the Gospel message by our
loving service of others, always pointing back to our Master and His
relationship with You.  It is in the name of Jesus, our Master and Your
Servant, that we make this prayer.  For He is not only our role model of caring
and loving, but also He has brought us Your salvation through His own death and
resurrection.  To You be all glory and honor and praise in and through Your
Son, Jesus, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Joseph the Worker</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Thu. of the 2nd Week of Easter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Joseph the Workerr Readings:  Acts 5: 27-33;         
Psalm 34: 2 and 9, 17-18, 19-20 ;           John 3: 31-36</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings speak about testimony and the Spirit.  The
First Reading relates what St. Peter and St. John say to the religious leaders
when they are brought before Sanhedrin (the council of religious leaders) to
answer for their disobeying the council’s orders.  Peter (speaking for the
other disciples) replies that they must give witness to the truth of GOD and
they do it by and through the power of the Holy Spirit.  In the Gospel, Jesus
tells Nicodemus that He must continue to speak about the relationship He has
with His Abba-Father because He has been empowered by the Holy Spirit for this
very task.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the selection from the Acts of the Apostles, St. Peter
and the other apostles act boldly.  Not only have they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>returned to the Temple to continue to announce the GOoD News
of Jesus, but also, they proudly proclaim Jesus’ Name, the very thing that the
religious leaders have forbidden them to do.  Nothing will silence them, since
they have been “apostled” (sent) by GOD to speak GOD’s word.  Obeying GOD’s
command is more important than obeying the orders of mortals, even if they are
the religious authorities.  It is not just the apostles and disciples who
testify that Jesus died and rose for the forgiveness of sin; the Holy Spirit –
GOD’s divine Spirit – is also testifying to the Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a prayer of praise and trust in GOD.  The words
of the psalmist could easily be those of Peter and his companion.  First, GOD
is praised and given glory for all that the divine hand has done.  Continuing
on, the psalmist admits that there have been difficult and trying times, but
with deep and abiding trust in GOD, everything works out for the GOoD of those
who are faithful to LORD GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His instruction of
Nicodemus.  Jesus announces that the One “from above” (–ἄνωθεν - anothen) can
speak of His experience of GOD because He has been with GOD.  Not only does
Jesus Himself give witness to the love that GOD has for the people, but also
the Holy Spirit gives witness to the eternal life that is the gift for all
those who believe.  With these two (Jesus and the Holy Spirit) as official
witnesses, the Truth cannot be denied:  GOD so loves the world that GOD sent
the only begotten Son so that all those who believe in Him might have eternal
life, and those who refuse to believe, after they have been given the
opportunity to believe, will experience GOD’s wrath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these readings, I am both excited and
challenged.  The excited feeling comes from knowing that when I give witness to
the Truth, I am not acting alone, but speaking in the Name of Jesus and with
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>power of the Holy Spirit.  Obviously, I have to be authentic
to the Truth and speak what Jesus has revealed in His word and His ministry,
and through His Church.  With this confidence, the same confidence that allowed
Peter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the other disciples to speak up, I can boldly lift up
the Name of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During Lent, I focused on the life of St. Peter quite a bit,
as I shared with various individuals a scriptural reflection that I had put
together about Peter.  We had discussed the human qualities of Peter and the
change that occurred in his life.  The four Gospels portray him, in his
pre-Pentecostal life, as a spontaneous individual who blurts out his immediate
reaction without thinking of the consequences.  On the night before Jesus died,
Peter strongly and confidently proclaimed his allegiance to Jesus and he said
that he was willing to die for Jesus, even if all </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the others turned away.  Yet, before the dawn came the next
morning, he had denied any relationship with Jesus – three times.  Even on
Easter Sunday morning as he ran to the empty tomb, he could not bring himself
to the full understanding that Jesus was risen and alive (John 20: 1-10).  Even
after experiencing his Risen Lord, Peter could not fully commit himself to
loving Him unconditionally (John 21: 15-19).  Yet within two months (that
included Jesus’ appearance giving Shalom and the full empowerment by the Holy
Spirit on Pentecost), Peter is actively proclaiming the Name of Jesus in
defiance of the commands of the religious authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenged feeling (that I have) comes from knowing that
I am not only privileged to proclaim the GOoD News, but also, I am required to
do so.  This is my calling as a member of the Body of Christ, a disciple of
Jesus.  It also requires that I continue to deepen my own relationship with
Jesus, His Abba, and the Holy Spirit with more reflection on the Word and with
prayer.  I still may not be at the point Peter and the apostles were when they
walked into the Temple and openly defied the orders of the Sanhedrin.  With
continued graces from the Lord Jesus and further empowering by the Holy Spirit,
I may have the courage to say the words that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter spoke to the Sanhedrin:  “We must obey GOD, not
people.”  Hopefully, I will also then be able to join the psalmist today and
declare: “Those who look to GOD are radiant; their faces</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are never covered with shame.  The poor called, and the LORD
heard them; GOD saved them out of all their troubles.  The angel of the LORD
encamps around those who fear GOD, and GOD delivers them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my image of
St. Peter? Can I identify with him and the continued changes that occurred in
his life as a result of His experiencing the Risen Lord and the empowerment of
the Holy Spirit?  How willingly am I to boldly proclaim my faith in the Name of
Jesus? To whom can I proclaim the GOoD News today and help them know the power
of the Name of Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and forgiving.  
Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son into the world to bring the world
into a closer relationship with You.  Jesus announced Your message of loving
forgiveness through His teaching, ministry, life, death, and resurrection.  He
came to give witness to Your GOoD News and has empowered His followers to
continue His work, especially with sending of the Holy Spirit. May we realize
the honor (and duty) You have given us in bearing witness to the Name of
Jesus.  For the times we have been reluctant to stand up for our relationship
with You, we seek the pardon that Jesus has provided through His suffering,
death, and resurrection.  May we go out as today’s apostles and give witness to
Your message.  We make this prayer in the very Name that we are called to
proclaim, Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and Master-Teacher, Who
has died, is risen, and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Athanasius</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(readings from Fri. of the 2nd Week of Easter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Athanasius:   Readings:  Acts 5: 34-42;         Psalm
27:  1, 4, 13-14;         John 6:  1-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both of today’s readings give us accounts of bad news and
GOoD News.  The bad news in the First Reading is the suffering of the apostles,
whereas the GOoD News is the proclamation of Who Jesus is.  The bad news in the
Gospel is that people are suffering from hunger.  The GOoD News is that Jesus
takes, blesses, and distributes food to the hungry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading from the Acts of the Apostles presents an
interesting episode.  The apostles are sent out from the assembly of the Jewish
religious leaders.  A noted rabbi, Gamaliel, speaks up about how to deal with
the apostles.  He mentions that if the ministry of the apostles is not from GOD,
then it will die out on its own.  If their ministry is from GOD, then the
religious leaders will not be able to stop them without fighting GOD.  The
leaders decide to have the apostles whipped and sent away.  The apostles rejoice
that they are found worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm speaks of the loveliness of being in the house of GOD. 
Waiting for the fulfillment of the LORD’s promises is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>worth the wait.  Those who are blessed to come into the
presence of the LORD experience a closeness to GOD –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that is GOoD News</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel begins “The Bread of Life” chapter of St. John’s
Gospel.  Today Jesus feeds the multitude with a few loaves of bread and a
couple dried fish.  All 5000+ people eat until they are totally satisfied, and
there is plenty left over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the First Reading, I was struck by the
wisdom of Gamaliel.  How true are his words.  If something is not of GOD, its
importance will end someday.  If it is truly of GOD, then there is nothing that
can stop it.  That is a GOoD way for us to know if we are fulfilling the will
of GOD.  Is what we are doing,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>something that will have a positive and lasting effect and
lead to the glory and praise of GOD? Or is it something that is going to wither
away.  Obviously, the Church has striven to carry on the ministry of Jesus. 
This has been done not only by the popes, cardinals, bishops, and priests, but
also by the laity.  The Church has survived nearly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2000 years.  There have been some occasions when the Church
has not been as faithful to GOD’s calling as it could have been.  Yet, overall,
the Church has continued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I agree with the words of today’s psalm:  “One thing I seek
– to dwell in the house of the LORD.”  During the time of CoronaVirus pandemic,
it did mean that we just longed to once again gather as a community in our
local churches, but it also meant to dwell in the eternal house of the LORD in
heaven.  That is what is most important. We need to keep our eyes focused on
the Lord Jesus and doing GOD’s will and dwelling with GOD forever.  It is
important to be willing to wait for the time when we will be in the eternal
presence of GOD forever.  And that type of waiting demands more than just
standing in line.  It takes an active, disciplined life of service, to show</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we have accepted the gift of faith which has been
offered us by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s abundant providence and desire to care for our well-being
is manifested in today’s Gospel.  Jesus has spent quite a bit of time
ministering to those who sought His help and His preaching of the GOoD News of
GOD’s love.  After taking care of their emotional and spiritual needs and
healing their afflictions,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus wants to show His concern – His Abba-Father’s concern
– for their whole well-being.  The bad news is these people are hungry and the
apostles only know of a few loaves of inexpensive bread and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a couple of dried fish.  The GOoD news:  Jesus knows the
people are hungry.  He has a plan to take care of their hunger.  He first asks
the apostles to meet the needs of the people.   The bad news:  obviously, as
Philip points out, the apostles cannot take care of the needs even if they have
200 days’ wages (and a store or marketplace nearby).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The GOoD News:  Jesus takes the few loaves of bread.  He
says a berakah – a prayer of thanks, praise, and blessing.  He then provides
nourishment for those who are hungry.  And when the huge crowd had fully eaten,
there were twelve baskets full of leftovers. [The number twelve implies
completion and fullness, and GOD’s will of completing, e. g., twelve tribes of
Israel, the twelve apostles.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we face bad news – hunger and thirst for righteousness
and have pains because things are not going right</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or feel burdened by the terrible events and happenings, such
as climate, or political tensions, or killing of innocent people – we need to
turn to Jesus.  The GOoD News is that Jesus will provide for our needs.  Jesus
knows our needs and He is concerned about our concerns before we even are aware
of them.  Jesus will take care of us.  We just need to keep our eyes focused on
Jesus, the Master- Teacher.  If we remain in tune with Jesus, then nothing will
be able to destroy our relationship with GOD, for that is what GOD wills.  Even
with all the concerns we have about bad news with our Church, with our
spiritual leaders, with nations at war, with natural disasters, with our
government, with various medical issues– nothing will ever be able to separate
us from the love of GOD. That’s the GOoD News that is more powerful than the
earthly bad news in the world today.  And nothing will overcome the GOoD News
if it is GOD’s GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How am I affected by
the earthly bad news that is broadcasted to me? Do I sometime lose focus and
dwell on the earthly, often bad, news (such as the current health crisis,
climatic change, or political issues and contentions) rather than on the GOoD
News that comes from the Lord Jesus? For what am I willing to wait? Is the
object of my waiting just a passing moment, or do I wait for that which will
last for eternity? And as I wait, am I actively promoting the GOoD News of
GOD?  How have I experienced the abundant provision by GOD? How will I proclaim
the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus to those whom I encounter today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of GOoD News.  Through
Your GOoDness, You hate evil and wrong doing, yet love the sinner.  You want to
bring healing and fullness to all peoples.  We are surrounded by the bad news
of pain, evil, and the harm inflicted upon ourselves and others.  We find it
hard to see any GOoD News in the midst of all the bad news.  Yet Your will and
plan will be done.  The GOoD News which comes from You will prevail, and
nothing will be able to prevent the GOoD News from being proclaimed.  Through
the power of Your Holy Spirit, strengthen us so that we can bring GOoD News to
those who have been shaken in their faith in the darkness of the current or
past bad news.  Give us the words to speak to those who have lost hope and have
been broken by the evilness of those who are not faithful to the GOoD News. 
Help us to continue the ministry of Your Son, Jesus, Who came to satisfy our
every needs and provide in abundance for all our needs.  Keep our eyes focused
on the GOoD News of Your love, so that we can continue to give You all the
praise, glory, and honor while others are uttering curses.  Let us see that
being in Your presence is worth waiting for and worth putting up with the
problems that come our way.  And if we are called to suffer for the sake of the
Name of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, may we, with the apostles of old and the modern
martyrs, give You thanks for allowing us to bear true witness to You through
our suffering.  We make this prayer of praise and thanks and petition, in the
Name of Jesus, Your Son, our Lord, our Risen Savior and loving Brother, Who provides
abundantly for us and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feast of Saints Philip and James</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(replacing Sat. of the 2nd Week of Easter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Philip and James:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Corinthians 15: 1-8;        Psalm 19:  2-3,
4-5;        John 14: 6-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Feast of St. Philip and St. James
(the Lesser).  Little is known about these two apostles.  Philip is mentioned
more often in the Gospels than James.  St. James is not the James who is the
brother of St. John the Apostle.  Philip is often portrayed in scripture as the
one who does not fully understand or grasp what Jesus is all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In St. Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians, he mentions
the key events in the life of Jesus: Christ suffered for our sins, died, and
was raised up, and then He appeared to the apostles and other early believers,
eventually</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>appearing even to Paul.  It is upon the faith of these
eyewitnesses that the Church has been built.  The apostles</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are the foundation of this edifice.  We, the other building
blocks in the Church, have all been built on these foundation stones and we
become the support of those who are built upon us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel relates Philip’s questions of Jesus at the Last
Supper. Jesus has just told His followers that He is the Way, the Truth, and
the Life and that no one comes to His Abba-Father except through Jesus Himself. 
Philip asks Jesus to show them the Abba.  Jesus replies:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Have I been with you for so long a time and you still do
not know me, Philip?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I continue to be in awe of the plan of GOD as revealed by
Jesus. Jesus chooses as His apostles those individuals with whom we can identify. 
Jesus could have chosen people who were almost perfect, or at least individuals
whom the world would admire as “superpersons.”  Yet He selected persons who
were just like us.  James we only know by name and little else.  Like James,
after our lives, probably, most of us will be known by only a few persons of
our generation, and only by our name, if that.  Most of us will not have our
names in history books.  Yet, James was a disciple, an apostle, a follower of
Jesus.  In a similar way we are called to be disciples, apostles, and followers
of Jesus, not seeking to have our names written in human history books, but in
the Book of Life, that is known by GOD and all those who share in the eternal
life in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Philip, when he is mentioned in the Gospel, is either being
asked a question by Jesus (as we hear in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John 6: 1-15) or asks a question of Jesus, showing that
Philip has not yet fully grasped the mission and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ministry of Jesus.  How often we are like Philip.  Jesus
asks us, as He did Philip, “How are you going to care for others?” (John 6:
6-7)  We are often overwhelmed with the enormity of the situation of caring for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>everyone.  We think we have to do it by ourselves, rather
than trust that Jesus already knows what He is going to do and is just asking
the question of us to see if we trust Him enough to see us through the
situation.  At</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other times we question Jesus.  We want to see the full
picture, just as Philip wanted Jesus to reveal His Abba</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(John 14: 6-9 - from today’s Gospel).  We do not realize,
just as Philip did not realize, that if we keep our eyes </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>focused on Jesus, then we will see more than we can ever
desire, hope for, or imagine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today ends with words which we must make part of
our lives.  Jesus address His disciples (the first apostles and also us),
saying:  “Whoever believes in Me will do the works that I do, and greater ones
than these. . .And whatever you ask in My name, I will do. . .If you ask
anything of Me in My name, I will do it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What a great promise Jesus has given us.  How blessed we
are.  Yet, we cannot fully understand that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because we are still growing and developing.  As we
celebrate today’s feast of Saints James and Philip, we are once again reminded
that following Jesus is not a one-time thing.  We do not have it all as soon as
we make the original decision to follow Jesus.  The journey to Jesus’ Abba (the
journey on which Jesus is the Way, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Truth, and the Life) is a process – a life-long process. 
GOD is not finished with us yet, just because we say, “I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will follow Jesus.”  We will continue to grow and develop as
the apostles did.  We will miss the point over and over again.  We may not have
our whole life stories remembered, but that is not the point of life.  The
point of life is to journey along with Jesus as He leads us to the home of His
Abba, Whom He has given to us as our Abba, and Who happens to be GOD.  As long
as GOD “knows” us as belonging to the Lord Jesus, it does not matter if anyone
else ever remembers us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think about
my passing from this life to the next, for what would I like to be remembered
by those whom I leave behind? When I struggle with understanding what the Lord
Jesus wants of me, do I ask Him, and truly listen to the response that He gives
me through scripture, my prayer time, and the words of others? How can I be a
better building block for those stones who will come after me or who rely on me
so that they can be built into the household of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and ever patient. 
Through Your GOoDness, You continue to call people to follow Your Son as He
leads us to You.  We often begin to follow, but we don’t understand the full
impact of what Jesus has come to share with us.  Jesus asks us questions to see
if we are starting to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understand His message.  We often ask questions that show we
have not yet fully grasped the GOoD News that Jesus has come to bring to us. 
As we journey along, You continue to raise individuals as role models, as Your
Son did in calling the apostles James and Philip.  They are not role models
because they had it all together, but because they grew in appreciation of the
message of Your Son and His revelation of You to them.  May we be edified by their
example, and may we be lifted up by their being the foundation and role models
of our believing.  Through the continuing presence of Your Holy Spirit, inspire
us to support those who come after us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as they are being built into the edifice of Your Church.  We
ask this in Jesus’ name, since He promised that He would give us whatever we
ask in His name, for He is our Lord and Master, He is Your Son and our Brother,
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen. Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third Sunday of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Michael Giedroyc</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 5: 27-32, 40b-41;     Psalm 30: 2, 4, 5-6,
11-12, 13;     Revelation 5: 11-14;     John 21: 1-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following the Risen Lord Jesus can lead both to periods of
great joy and to times of persecution, and sometimes to both at the same time. 
In our First Reading we hear how the Spirit-filled St. Peter rejoices in being
able to give witness to the name of Jesus even if that means his having to
suffer for doing so.  The Responsorial Psalm is a prayer of one who realizes
that GOD protects the faithful one even in the midst of one’s enemies.  The
reading from the Book of Revelation gives us a glimpse into the joyful
celebration of GOD’s heavenly court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel recounts another of the Risen Lord’s appearances
to some of His disciples, this time at the Sea of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Galilee and the long form of the Gospel also focuses on
Peter’s response to Jesus’ presence and His questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from the Acts of the Apostles takes place within
the first few weeks after the descent of the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit on Pentecost Sunday.  The apostles (with a focus on
Peter) are truly inspired and enthusiastic as they go out and boldly proclaim
the GOoD News of Jesus, healing people in the Name of Jesus.  Nothing will stop
their mission.  Even when they are arrested and brought before the religious
high court and ordered to stop preaching the Name of Jesus, they respond by
saying that it is more important to do what GOD has commanded them than to
listen to the demands of mere mortals (even if those mortals are authorities in
the religion).  The last verses describe that they are joy-filled because they
have been found worthy to be persecuted for their allegiance to Jesus and His
Name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist seems to have undergone a similar experience of
having been persecuted for belief in GOD.  The trust that the psalmist has in
the GOD Who can “protect” him from the hands of his enemies would be words</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that Peter and the other apostles could easily affirm. 
“Protection” does not necessarily mean “freedom from suffering” because one is
faithful to GOD’s directives.  It stems from being able to endure whatever
happens and not giving up one’s trust in GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John, in the Book of Revelation, gives us a peek into the
heavenly home of GOD where the Lamb and His Abba-Father (the One seated on the
throne) are worshiped with great joy and celebration.  The celestial praise of
the Lamb Who was sacrificed and yet Who was glorified is presented in a way
that matches the most magnificent earthly pageants.  Think of the most
spectacular celebrations (crowning of a king, presidential inauguration, awards
show, papal installation) and they are nothing compared to the majesty of the
worship of the Lamb and the One seated on the throne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, we continue with our post-Resurrection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>appearances of Jesus to His disciples.  Since Jesus is not
with His followers each and every moment (in fact not even every day) after His
resurrection, but only appears occasionally, the apostles have time on their
hands as they await for another revelation of their Savior and Lord.  Since the
Lord Jesus told them to return to Galilee to await His next meeting with them
and being fishers by trade (at least four of them), they spend the night
fishing.  Even though the night is the best time to catch fish, and the deeper
part of the Sea is the best place to net a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>load of fish, they catch nothing at all.  As the dawn is
breaking, they head back to shore.  It is then that they see Someone preparing
a fish breakfast on the shore of the sea.  As is the custom among fishers, the
Person on the shore calls out to see if the anglers have caught anything.  When
the apostles answer in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the negative, the Questioner tells them to lower their nets
in the shallow (not usually filled with fish) waters and bring in their catch.
After catching a huge amount of fish, the disciple whom Jesus loves realizes it
is the Lord Jesus.  Peter dons more clothing (since he had been stripped down
to the bare minimum while fishing during the balmy spring night) and jumps into
the water with all of his clothes on.  Peter seems to have forgotten his </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>companions and the load of fish until Jesus requests that
the disciples bring in the fish. Peter turns around and single- handedly hauls
in the net loaded with fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The longer version of the Gospel continues with Jesus
pulling Peter aside to talk to him. Scholars have debated over the use of two
different Greek words for “love” in this passage. Jesus asks Peter twice, “Do
you love (using a form of the verb agapas) me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter responds, “Yes, I love (using a form of the verb
phileo) you.”  Agapas-love is word which is often translated “unconditional love.”
Phileo-love is referred to as “love of duty or because of a relationship.” The
third time Jesus uses the phileis verb when</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>asking Peter, “Do you love me?” Again, Peter responds with
the phileo form of the verb when he says, “You know that I love you.” Jesus
tells Peter that love will require him to serve, feed, and care for the flock
entrusted to him. It will eventually lead to the fact that he will be led away
by others and have to do something he does not want to do – suffer and die – as
a result of his love for Jesus and His flock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am reminded that being
faithful to the Name of Jesus will be at times very joy-filled (especially in
the eternal presence of GOD, but also even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>now), but it may require that I suffer and be persecuted for
my allegiance to the Name. As with many things on my spiritual journey, that
leaves me with both an excited, uplifted feeling and a somewhat guarded,
anxious feeling. I am reminded that following the Risen Lord is not always pure
ecstasy and an upbeat experience. Jesus’ hour of glory included both the cross
and the empty tomb. In this life we cannot expect to arrive at the glory of an
eternal experience without having to carry and die on the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also reassured as I look at Peter. Peter lived a life
that could easily follow the pattern of a roller coaster. He at times was at
the very bottom (after his three-fold denial of Jesus, or when Jesus scolded
him for tempting Him to choose any easier way). At other times Peter was flying
high (at the Transfiguration, on Easter Sunday evening, after receiving the
Holy Spirit on Pentecost). Peter manifested in his life that following the Lord
Jesus can entail both moments of intense joy and revelation, and also times of
having to suffer for the name of Jesus. (Peter’s uncertainty is portrayed well
in the movie,  Full of Grace from ODB Films.)  I can expect nothing more or
less. Yet the key point I must remember is that Jesus is asking me as He asked
Peter, “Do you love Me?” I must respond not just in words, but with my very
existence, “You know that I love You.” And may the meaning of the word “love”
be “unconditional, unwavering, and always enthusiastic total commitment to the
Lamb of GOD and to the One seated on the throne.” It is then that we will be
able to join the psalmist and pray, “Sing praise to the LORD, you GOD’s
faithful ones, and give thanks to the holy name of LORD GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When have I
experienced great joy in being a follower of the Lord Jesus? Have there been
times when it was hard to be a witness for Jesus? How would I respond to Jesus
when He asks me: “Do you love me?” How will I live out my response to that
question? Who might be the most in need of my living out the love I have for
the Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD ever to be worshiped and praised.
Through Your GOoDness and the ministry of Your Son, You call us into a closer
relationship with You. You invite us to give witness to that relationship by
proclaiming the holy Name of You and Your Son. As we do as You have commanded
us, we experience both the moments of excitement and enthusiasm and also the
challenges associated with being faithful to You. Help us to show our love for
You and Your Son, both when things are going well and when we face
difficulties, especially for being faithful disciples of Jesus. For the times
we have failed to love You and to tend to the needs of those who have been
entrusted to us, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness, made possible through the
death and resurrection of Jesus. To You, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit be all
honor, glory, and praise for You in the Unity of the Trinity are our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of the Third Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Hilary of Arles</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 6: 8-15;         Psalm 119: 23-24, 26-27,
29-30;        John 6: 22-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen, one of the first διακονοι (diakonoi - a word that
means “deacons,” “ministers,” or “servants”), is the center of today’s First
Reading.  Although his main function is to tend to the physical needs of the
people, we see him engaging in dialogue with certain Jewish sympathizers (gentiles
who are leaning toward the teachings of Judaism).  Stephen demonstrates his
gift of the Holy Spirit by his speaking with wisdom and knowledge.  Some people
try to accuse Stephen of speaking blasphemy against the Jewish faith.  Stephen
is brought before the leaders in the Sanhedrin who hear the false testimony
(fake facts) against him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm resonates with Stephen as he faces opposition.  It
speaks about the true believer remaining tuned to the will of GOD, even while
other individuals plot against the true believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today is a continuation of the sixth chapter of
St. John’s Gospel.  (This chapter began last week.) The crowd of people realize
that Jesus and His disciples have left the seaside town of Tiberias and have
probably rowed/sailed to Capernaum.  They had seen Jesus’ disciples leave, but
they had not seen Jesus leave.  They head out for Capernaum also.  When they
arrive in Capernaum, they find Jesus and His followers.  They question Jesus
about how He has come to Capernaum.  [They do not realize that Jesus walked on
the water to join His disciples as we would have read last Saturday if we had
not celebrated the Feast of St. Philip and James.]  Jesus realizes they have
come because of their being fed when He multiplied the bread and fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the First Reading, I realize that Stephen is
truly a Spirit-filled individual.  The Spirit gives him the words to speak in
order to share the GOoD News with others.  Yet, in performing his ministry with
wisdom and courage, he meets opposition.  There are people who are opposed to
the Truth he is preaching.  They want to silence him.  Stephen, as we will see
in the subsequent readings later this week, keeps his focus on the Lord Jesus
even in the face of persecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we turn to the Gospel, we see that Jesus is challenged by
people who have come to Him for the wrong reasons.  They want more miracles. 
Jesus tells them that they should focus not on their own immediate desires but
on the important things of life – believing in the One Whom GOD had sent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today make me look at what is the center of my
focus.  At times I focus on having my cravings for worldly things satisfied.  I
am interested in being well received by others for my achievements.  I don’t
want to rock any boats or cause waves.  Yet, I see that if I really let the
Holy Spirit fill</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me with wisdom and truth, I would turn my attention to where
it should be – my relationship with Jesus and sharing that with others.  The
more I stay focused on Jesus, the more I will be given the words to speak,
especially at times when I am being challenged about my relationship with
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the importance of the “Jesus Prayer.”  It is
simply:  “Lord Jesus, Son of the Living GOD, have mercy on me, a sinner.”  This
was mentioned in a retreat in which I participated a while ago.  I have also
heard it in many homilies,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in which it was suggested that we should say the Jesus
Prayer at least five times each day, especially when we are </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>facing challenging times, whether as individuals or as part
of a large group of people.  It might be when we are at an extra-long red
light, or stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, or being frustrated while at work,
or dealing with the repercussions of illnesses (of ourselves or others), or at
those trying times when a member of our family seems to be making a point of
aggravating us, or when we are affected by world problems and higher prices, or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>climate problems.  I realize the purpose of the “Jesus
Prayer” is to focus my attention back on what is important – my relationship
with Jesus.  It acknowledges Who Jesus is – the Son of the Living GOD.  It also
makes me conscious of the fact that I cannot do anything without Jesus’ help –
His mercy.  That’s all I really need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I suggest that we pray the Jesus prayer not only for
ourselves, but for others.  There may be people with whom we come in contact
who need prayer, such as those facing trials associated with illnesses, or
tension from people who have a different political view from us, or
weather-related issues.  It helps each of us to be a servant- minister
(diakonos) to them if we pray for them.  And the more we pray for an individual
or a group of individuals, the more we will be accepting of the person, without
necessarily agreeing with her/his actions or all of her/his views.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to be attuned to Who Jesus is, we will not
worry if our own desires are being or not being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>met, because we will have the knowledge and trust that our
needs are being taken care of by GOD.  We will not be chasing Jesus so He can
perform another miracle for us.  Rather we will seek out Jesus because He is
the One Whom GOD the Abba-Father has sent to us, and we will want to deepen our
relationship with Jesus and His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba, in the unity of the Spirit.  St. Stephen was well
aware of his trust in Jesus.  That is what empowered him to fulfill his
ministry as a deacon (minister, servant).  And it should be that on which we
should focus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What motivates me
to seek the Lord Jesus? Am I hoping for another sign or miracle?  Do I want
Jesus to meet my personal desires? Do I seek to develop the willingness to do
GOD’s will and not my own? How can I be more aware of the power of the Holy
Spirit in my life, guiding me particularly in those challenging times?  In what
ways might the Lord Jesus be calling me to be a διακονος (diaconos - servant)
today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and always merciful. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have shown through the life of Jesus that You will
provide for us no matter in what situation we find ourselves.  You give us the
gifts of Your Holy Spirit – especially wisdom and courage – so that we can face
opposition and give witness to our relationship with You and Your Son.  May we
stay focused on the GOoD News that Your Son Jesus came to share with us.  In
this way, we will be able to give You the praise and glory that You are due. 
We make this prayer through the same Jesus, Your Son, our Lord, our Risen
Savior and loving Brother, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia! <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of the Third Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Marian and James:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 7: 51– 8: 1a;       Psalm 31: 3-4cd, 6 and
7b and 8a, 17 and 21ab;        John 6: 30-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the readings speak of the relationship that exists
between a believer and GOD.  The more one draws closer to GOD, the stronger the
relationship is.  The believer knows that GOD will provide all that is
necessary for life – life now – and also eternal life.  All that is asked of
the believer is to proclaim one’s relationship with GOD.  Our First Reading is
an account of the martyrdom of St. Stephen.  He is the first Christian martyr. 
As he faces his death, Stephen places himself into the hands of GOD.  The psalm
echoes Stephen’s faith in the words “Into Your hands I commend my spirit.”  It
is a psalm of trust in GOD.  Jesus, in the Gospel, describes Himself as the
Bread of Life which nourishes those who receive Him – and this nourishment is
forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen is the first martyr.  The Greek word for “martyr” is
ìáñôõñïò (martyros) which means “witness.”  Stephen gives witness to his
relationship with GOD by the ultimate sign of witnessing – his death.  As a
Spirit-filled individual and a man of faith and wisdom, he knows the cost of
giving witness.  In his final speech, Stephen reflects on the role of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prophets of old.  They were persecuted by unfaithful
individuals.  Stephen is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>willing to take on the role of prophet (to speak for GOD)
and to give witness to the relationship that GOD wants to establish with those
who believe in the Lord Jesus.  Thus, as he is being dragged out of the city of
Jerusalem (through a gate which to this day is called “Stephen’s Gate” by
Christians) and stoned, he looks to the heavens and sees Jesus, his Risen
Lord.  He hands over his body to Jesus saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
. .Lord, do not hold this sin against them.”  One of those to whom he gives
witness is a young man named Saul (of Tarsus who will later become Paul, the
Apostle to the Gentiles).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting on the background of today’s Gospel, we recall
that Jesus has feed the multitude on the day before – earlier in the same sixth
chapter of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Gospel of St. John.  The people in today’s Gospel seek a
sign from Jesus.  They know Jesus is a great teacher and prophet like Moses of
old.  As GOD’s spokesperson, Moses “performed” many signs (from the ten plagues</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the feeding of the Israelites in the desert).  Jesus
reminds His listeners that Moses did not do the miracles.  It was GOD Who
provided for the people.  Jesus continues by saying that GOD (Jesus’
Abba-Father) is now providing an even better Bread – a Bread that gives eternal
life.  The people cry out for this Bread.  Jesus says that He is the Bread of
Life.  He is the One Who will nourish the believers in a way in which they will
never want for any other food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bread is the staple of life.  Different cultures have various
forms of bread, but it still is the main food for daily existence.  Jesus says
that He is That Which (Who) nourishes, and He is the essential food for life –
eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today challenge me to look at what my
relationship with Jesus is.  I ask myself, “Do I really seek Jesus as the
source of my life?”  I need to come to my Master-Teacher and feed on Him – His
Word, His Life, His Body.  The more I deepen my relationship with Jesus, the
more I will be able to be a martyr for (witness to) Jesus – the more I will
want to be a martyr (witness).  I will be like Stephen who was so overwhelmed
by his </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with Jesus that he could do nothing other than
be a martyr for (witness to) Jesus.  I may not have to die by being stoned or
even persecuted, but I should be willing to profess my faith relationship.  And
I will only be able to do that if I feed on Jesus, the Bread of Life.  I need
to come to my Master-Teacher and be nourished by Him, as I sit down at table
with Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not easy to be a martyr/witness.  It takes a strong
conviction and committed belief.  It takes a deep relationship with GOD.  It
takes knowing Jesus as my Master-Teacher, my source of nourishment.  If I
regularly come to be fed by Jesus, then I will be supplied with all I need to
live a life of a witness – a martyr – not to a cause, but to the person of
Jesus, my Lord and my GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What is the source
of my strength to be a martyr (witness) for Jesus?  How do I give witness to
Who Jesus is in my life?  To whom might I witness today and in what manner so
that he/she/they might come into a closer relationship with the Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, worker of wonders. Through Your
GOoDness, You have always provided for those who believe in You.  During the
time of Moses, You feed Your people with manna in the desert.  You continued to
call forth spokespersons for, and witnesses to, the relationship You wished to
have with Your chosen people.  You continued to nourish Your people through
Jesus, Your Son.  He came to share Your GOoD News and He fed the multitude with
a few loaves of bread and a couple of fish. He then promised an even greater
sign of Your love and Your desire to take care of our needs by feeding us with the
Heavenly Bread – His very Self.  We ask that You strength us, especially with
the Bread of Life, so that we can be His faithful witnesses-martyrs. May our
lives reflect the relationship that we have with You and be an invitation for
others to draw ever closer to You.  We make this prayer of praise and thanks
and petition, in the name of Jesus, Your Son, our Lord, our Risen Savior and
loving Brother, the Bread of Life, Who nourishes us for eternal life, and Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 7, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of the Third Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Rose Venerini:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 8: 1b– 8;       Psalm 66: 1-3a, 4-5,
6-7a;      John 6: 35-40</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What great joy can come from doing what GOD wills!  For me,
that is the theme running through our readings today.  After the death of St.
Stephen, the early Church faces persecution.  Yet, even in the face of
imprisonment and death, the people of the Way (an early name for the Christian
movement) rejoice in the GOoD News as proclaimed by the apostles and
disciples.  The focus now shifts from Jerusalem to the other towns of Judea and
into Samaria.  The Spirit is moving the Church outward and the Spirit causes
joy as the Church spreads out and increases in numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes this in the refrain:  “Let all the earth
cry out to GOD with joy.”   Joy is the natural feeling of those who experience
the great deeds of our GOD.  Joy is different than happiness.  Joy is the
feeling of knowing one is in touch with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about doing the will of His
Abba-Father.  This is the food that nourishes Jesus, and Jesus, in turn,
becomes our food that will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>quench our thirst and end our hungry.  Jesus promises to
raise up those who believe in His relationship with His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba; and being raised up is what eternal life is all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on my life and the life of other believers, I
am continually amazed at the joy that comes to those who seek a relationship
with GOD.  Joy is not frivolous giddiness.  It is a sense of inner peace.  Even
in the midst of the most challenging events in life, a follower of Jesus has a
sense of fulfillment and can rejoice in the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think of all those who are facing life-threatening
sickness.  I also call to mind all those Ukrainians and Russians who suffered
and died with the conflict between the two countries, and all countries
throughout Europe and the rest of the world who were willing to do reach out to
those refugees from Ukraine and assist them. Others are going through
family/marital problems.  Still others are dealing with financial difficulties
because of high prices of items including fuel and food as compared to six
years ago.  Some are dealing with changes in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>jobs.  People are also struggling with political and
environmental issues.  Some families are suffering the loss of loved ones,
especially from gun-toting fanatics.  Yet, as I talk to individuals who are
struggling, the one thing they say over and over again is that their faith
relationship with the Lord Jesus is what gets them through the trying years,
months, days, hours, even seconds.  They realize that without their close
relationship with GOD and the strength they receive from friends who are
praying for them and with them, they would not be able to handle the pressures
in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their source of life comes from being fed by the Lord Jesus,
Who is the Bread of Life.  They feel lifted up, edified, and supported. They
know that Jesus is raising them up, not just on the last day, but every day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One example of this joy in the midst of pain and sorrow is a
friend of mine.  This individual has lost loved</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ones in death, had to put an aging parent in a facility for
the aged and infirm, experienced financial problems, had adult children
basically taking advantage of the person and not appreciating what was done for
them throughout their lives, and this person also suffers from physical ailments. 
This friend said to me, “I am living my hell now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>so I can enjoy the fulness of heaven in the next life.” 
This friend was aware that no matter how difficult things are now, they would
be a lot worse in the next life without a relationship with the Lord Jesus,
which can and should begin now.  I am reminded of St. Paul’s words, “Nothing
can separate us from the love of GOD poured out in Jesus Christ” (Romans 8:
39).  Paul mentions that neither pain nor sorrow, neither famine nor flood,
neither the past nor the future, nothing can separate us from GOD (Romans 8:
35-38).  So my friend could also say, “Neither loved ones’ deaths, nor caring
for family members who do care back; neither money worries nor  sickness can
separate one from the Love GOD poured out in Christ Jesus.”  We could also
proclaim that neither the illnesses, or our having to face political tensions,
or global warming problems will separate us from GOD’s love.  (At the end of
the reflection [pages</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3-5] are five more accounts of friends who have gone through
rough times and yet have sensed the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love of GOD as they look back upon their experiences. I have
permission to share them, but I have left out references to real names.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To me, one of the most important qualities of a Christian is
Joy.  I end most of my personal email reflections with “Enjoy,” which means
more to me than just having fun reading.  It means “In Joy.”  Joy is also high
on Pope Francis’ list of qualities.  A few years ago, I read his book, The Joy
of the Gospel.  He challenges all Christians to be people of Joy, especial as
we proclaim the GOoD News by our lifestyle and by our words.  In retreats I
have given, I speak about JOY and tell the retreatants that JOY is Jesus,
Others, and You – all being in relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only thing that can separate us from GOD is our choice
of refusing a relationship with GOD.  That is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ultimately the only thing that will prevent us from
experiencing the joy that comes from GOD.  And that is our choosing.  No
problems, difficulties, challenges, nor any other happening will stop GOD from
loving us.  And with GOD loving us, we can cry out to GOD with that inner joy
and peace that surpasses human understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, if we work on developing a deeper relationship with
GOD, we will see GOD’s hand at work in our life. Our problems will not be
over.  We will still have challenges in our lives, but we will sense the joy of
the Lord Jesus Who is our strength.  We will be able to see beyond the
difficulties of the here and now and start living the eternal life that Jesus
promises to give us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my attitude
when I am faced with challenging times?  Am I able to keep a sense of joy in
the midst of hardships?  What strength do I receive from coming to the Lord
Jesus, the Bread of Life, and feeding on Him?  How can I bring the presence of
the Lord Jesus and the joy of the Lord Jesus to another person who is going
through rough times?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, joy of human’s desiring.  Through
Your GOoDness, You offer us a greater joy than we could ever imagine.  Even in
the midst of our greatest difficulties, You promise us eternal life, in and
through Your Son, Jesus.  We come before You, struggling with the problems of
our lives.  We ask for a further outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, Your Spirit of
peace and joy, so that we will be strengthened as we walk through the valley of
darkness.  May we receive the nourishment we need by feeding on Jesus, the
Bread of Life.  We make this prayer of praise and thanks and petition, in the
name of Jesus, Your Son, our Lord, our Risen Savior and loving Brother, the
Bread of Life Who nourishes us for eternal life, and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.    Alleluia!

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of the Third Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Peter of Tarentaise:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 8: 26-40;        Psalm 66:  8-9, 16-17,
20;        John 6: 44-51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We continue our theme of joy and life coming from GOD.  In
the selection from the Acts of Apostle, joy comes from hearing GOD’s Word and
accepting Jesus.  The Responsorial is a psalm of joy.  Jesus, in the Gospel,
proclaims that He is the source of life for all who come to Him and receive
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading we hear how Philip, (mostly likely, one
of the seven deacons of Acts 6), shares the GOoD News of Jesus Christ with a
non-Jew.  This Ethiopian gentile (heathen) accepts Philip’s explanation of
Hebrew scripture and becomes a believer.  He is baptized immediately and goes
on his way, having joyfully accepted the message of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our psalm continues the hymn of joyful praise of GOD from
yesterday. Today, we are invited to rejoice in the GOD Who gives life to our
souls and Who answers our prayers.  This psalm unites the First Reading (which
shows how GOD answered the prayers of the “heathen”) and the Gospel (where
Jesus gives us life by being the Bread of Life for us).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues “the Bread of Life” discourse
that we have heard the last few days.  He relates the close relationship that
exists between Himself and His Abba-Father.  It is because of His wanting to
reveal the Abba that He has become the Bread of Life that gives life, eternal
life, to all who believe in Him and are fed by Him and on Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the First Reading, I am struck by the
Ethiopian who is reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.  Obviously, this
non-Jew is searching for something in the Hebrew scriptures.  Philip appears on
the scene and asks him if he knows what he is reading – that is, does he
understand that about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which Isaiah was writing.  The Ethiopian’s response is very
important:  “How can I unless someone explains</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it to me?”  Some people will never come to understand the
role of Jesus unless another person explains it to them.  Philip realizes he is
at the right place at the right time.  The Spirit has led him to be available
to someone who needs him to explain GOD’s plan – the sending of Jesus as the
Messiah Who quietly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>suffered in order to bring people into a closer relationship
with His Abba.  Once Philip has shared the GOoD News of Jesus with the
Ethiopian and brought him into a closer relationship with Jesus (including
being baptized), Philip is taken by the Holy Spirit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to another place to continue the ministry of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spreading the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has answered the prayer and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>yearning of the Ethiopian by sending Philip to explain the
Word of GOD.  In a similar, but more emphatic, way, GOD sent the Son to reveal
the great love GOD has for the world.  Jesus is the best manifestation of GOD’s
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>love.  Thus, Jesus can speak of people getting to know GOD
by getting to know Him and being fed by Him and on Him, since He is the Bread
of Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am once again touched by the generosity and benevolence of
GOD.  GOD provides for us.  GOD gives us the nourishment we need so we can have
life.  All GOD asks of us is that we take the GOoD News we have experienced and
be willing to share it with those whom GOD places in our path.  GOD wants us to
be bearers of Glad Tidings (GOoD News) to others.  There will be people in our
lives who are hungering for GOD and want to be fed by GOD’s Word, but they
cannot do it themselves.  They say, as the Ethiopian in today’s reading, “How
can I understand unless someone explains it to me?”  GOD may allow us to be the
ones who explain GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word to others.  We don’t need to be expert scripture
scholars.  We just need to have an ever-deepening relationship with GOD. 
That’s what we have the privilege to share with others.  We share how our
experiences of Jesus and His Abba have touched and transformed our lives.  And
the more we are in tune with Jesus and His Abba, Who happens to be GOD, the
more the Holy Spirit (Who is also GOD) will guide us and lead us as we journey
along the way with those who seek to know GOD.  To help us in our being in tune
with the Lord Jesus, we can continue to read and be nourished by the Word of
GOD, join a Bible Study group or other group who share the GOoD News of Jesus,
and be fed by the Bread of Life at the Table of the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, like Philip, may not be on the journey for a long time
with some of those whose paths we cross.  It may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be only a short encounter.  Yet, GOD can use our short time
with another person to help that person understand how much GOD loves them.  We
never know whose lives we will affect or how it will happen, we just need to be
ready to be GOD’s servants who (as St. Francis of Assisi said,) “proclaim the
Gospel at all times, and, if necessary, use words.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded of this when I was reading Pope Francis’
book, The Joy of the Gospel.  The pope reminds all Christians of their duty of
sharing the Glad Tidings – GOoD News – Gospel – with those we encounter in our
daily living.  (I used many quotes from the book when I led a Lenten Series of
Reflections on Discipleship a few years ago.)  We must share the GOoD News
joyfully.  People must see that we are happily excited about our relationship
with Jesus and His Abba in the unity of the Holy Spirit.  I know of an
individual who speaks to the checkout clerks at the grocery store and says,
“GOD bless you.”  He says how touched the clerks are to hear these words.  It
can be an invitation for them to accept (fuller) the joyful GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Who has come at the
right time in my life and shared the GOoD News that I needed to hear at that
time?  With whom might the Holy Spirit be leading me to share the GOoD News? 
How can I share the GOoD News with them? How can I feed on the Bread of Life
more fully?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever conscious of people’s hunger
for knowledge of Who You are.  Through Your GOoDness, You satisfy our hunger by
feeding us with Your Son, the Bread of Life.  Once we have tasted of Your
GOoDness, You ask us to go out and help others understand as they journey along
the road to You and to the home You and Your Son have prepared for all.  You
entrust us with the ministry of joyfully sharing our knowledge and experience
of Your great love with others.  We thank You and praise You for filling us
with that which nourishes and satisfies our hunger, and thus, allowing us to
provide food for thought for others.  We give You all the glory and praise as
others are drawn into a closer, life-giving relationship with You.  Continue to
open us to the movement of Your Holy Spirit, so we can be led to where You
would have us minister and to those whom You would have us serve.  We make this
prayer of praise and thanks and petition, in the name of Jesus, Your Son, our
Lord, our Risen Savior and loving Brother, the Bread of Life Who nourishes us
for eternal life, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen. Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 9, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of the Third Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John of Avila:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 9: 1-20;        Psalm 117: 1bc, 2;         
John 6: 52-59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two of the qualities that are the hallmarks of GOD
throughout the Bible are “steadfast (or loving) kindness” ([c]hesed) and
“enduring fidelity” (emet[h]).  These two qualities are reflected in the
shortest psalm in the Book of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Psalms – Psalm 117.  In the second and final verse of
this psalm we hear:  “For steadfast is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s kindness toward us, and the fidelity of the LORD
endures forever.”  It is from these that I have two points to ponder today. 
The first (steadfast kindness or “lovingkindness”) comes from the selection in
the Acts of the Apostles:  the conversion of St. Paul.  The second (enduring
fidelity) flows from the Gospel according to St. John:  Jesus’ insistence that
His followers eat His Body and drink His Blood.  Thus, we can say over and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>over again:  “For steadfast is GOD’s kindness to us, and the
fidelity of the LORD endures forever.” The First Reading gives us the account
of St. Paul’s life-changing experience</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the road to Damascus.  To understand how radical this
encounter was for Paul, we need to think about who Saul of Tarsus was.  Saul (a
Jewish name) was a Pharisee, a strict Jew who followed the precepts of the law
to the greatest</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>extreme.  Saul was also a Roman citizen who was fluent in
Greek, as well as Hebrew.  Saul was so caught up in fulfilling the letter of
the law that he was totally committed to the religious philosophy and legalism
of Judaism.  He believed in doing the legally right things (i.e., obeying the
strictest adherence to all laws), even if it hurt relationships – relationship
with others and even a relationship with GOD. Saul thought he had a duty to
purge Judaism of anything and anyone who did not fit into his understanding of
what the Judaic law prescribed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, it is that Saul is present at the stoning of Stephen,
the first Christian martyr (“witness”).  Saul proceeds to continue the
persecution of “the people of The Way” (an early Christian term for followers
of Jesus, Who is the Way).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading relates that on his journey to arrest
the Christians whom he considered to be “heretical” Jews, Saul is suddenly
enlightened.  When confronted with the Light, he realizes his blindness (not
only physical blindness, but also blindness to the Truth).  He is not just
trying to exterminate the followers of Jesus, he is persecuting Jesus, Himself. 
This new insight is so overwhelming that he cannot see what he is to do.  For
three days (interesting number), Saul remains in darkness, unable to see.  I’m
sure he does a lot of thinking.  He refrains from food and drink, purging
himself of all aspects of his old way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lord Jesus calls upon one of the Christian faithful in
Damascus to go to Saul and to bring him healing and to empower Ananias to be
the instrument GOD would use to open Saul’s eyes.  Ananias obviously is
concerned about going to the very person who has authority to arrest
Christians.  Yet GOD has chosen Saul for a very important work:  the
proclamation of the GOoD News of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles (non-Jews).  What
a switch Saul/Paul will have to undergo.  From being so closed-mindedly Jewish
that he wants to exterminate Jewish- Christians, he will become the champion of
the non-Jews in their following Jesus.  Saul has to go from a strict observer
of the Law and rituals to a man fully committed to a relationship with a
personal GOD.  GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>steadfast kindness/love ([c]hesed) is truly evident in the
way GOD treats Saul.  GOD does not desert him, even if Saul has misunderstood
Who GOD is.  Saul/Paul experiences the steadfast kindness of a loving GOD, of a
benevolent Savior.  Paul (a Roman name) now begins to know the steadfast
kindness ([c]hesed) from the way </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD treats him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second half of verse 2 of Psalm 117 speaks of the
fidelity (emet[h]) of the LORD enduring forever.  Thus, it is that Jesus gives
Himself to His followers under the form of bread and wine.  Jesus knows He will
not stay with His disciples in His earthly body when He ascends to heaven. 
Yet, Jesus wants to endure faithfully with His disciplined learners
(disciples).  Thus, he promises to nourish them with His very Body and Blood. 
He will feed them with His very flesh.  Yet, it would not be in the form of
cannibalism.  He will be giving His followers His very self as the Bread of
Life.  To me this sixth chapter of St. John’s Gospel is the strongest biblical basis
for the mainline churches’ belief in the real presence of Jesus in the
Eucharist.  Jesus wants His followers to be able to be in communion with Him</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and to feed on Him.  This will give them life – eternal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life.  It will enable Him to be with them, enduring
faithfully as their source of nourishment and life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the conversion of St. Paul and on Jesus as
the Bread of Life, I realize that I have a chance for eternal life, not because
of anything I do.  For like St. Paul, I have not always understood the plan of
GOD and,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>at times in the past, have worked against GOD’s plan by
being overly caught up in the religious philosophy, strict legalism, and
academic theology, rather than in deepening my relationship with a personal
GOD.  GOD is also calling me, and all Christians, to be enlightened by the
Truth rather than act in darkness and blindness.  I have the privilege – and
duty – of proclaiming the GOoD News to others, even if it is not to the extent
Paul did.  I need to continue the “conversion” experience as Paul did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also need to continue to come to Jesus, the Bread of Life,
and be nourished by Him so that I can experience the enduring faithfulness of
the Lord Jesus Who has chosen to feed us with His very Self.  How much our GOD
loves us that GOD would call us to conversion and full communion with Jesus. 
This manifests the steadfast kindness of our GOD.  GOD continues to strengthen
us and provide the very food that is our mainstay as we proclaim the enduring
faithfulness of our GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How have I
experience the steadfast loving- kindness and enduring faithfulness of GOD? To
what aspects of my faith have I been blind and not open to see what the Lord
Jesus would have me see?  How can I deepen my relationship with the Lord Jesus
Who desires that I feed on Him Who is the Bread of Life? How can I reach out to
others and help them experience the steadfast loving-kindness ([c]hesed) and
enduring faithfulness (emet[h]) of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, truly steadfastly and lovingly
kind and enduringly faithful, even when we don’t understand these qualities of
Yours.  Through Your GOoDness, You continue to call us from being so overly
concerned about precepts and rituals, philosophies and even the study of theology. 
You invite us into a relationship with You rather than with written human words
and rules.  We thank You for giving us the enlightenment we need to open our
eyes to Your loving-kindness and enduring faithfulness.  May we be strengthened
by Your Holy Spirit as St. Paul was.  May we be transformed and nourished by
Your Son, Jesus, Who has given us His Body and Blood as our food and drink.  We
praise You for Your steadfast kindness and enduring faithfulness to us.  This
we pray in and through Your Son, Jesus, Who is our Master and Teacher, Who
nourishes and sustains us and leads us to the home You have prepared for us and
where we will live with You, Your Son, and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of the Third Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Damien de Veuster of Moloka'i)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Damien de Veuster of Moloka'i:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 9: 31-42;       Psalm 116: 12-13, 14-15,
16-17;         John 6: 60-69</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our psalm selection today begins with the words:  “How shall
I make a return to the LORD for all the GOoD GOD has done for me?”  This should
be a question we ask ourselves every day, in fact, every minute of every day. 
Yet so many people do not ask that question.  Instead, they often ask:   “What
has GOD done for me?” or “Why has GOD allowed this terrible thing to happen to
me?”  They fail to see that every GOoD flows from GOD and that GOD can make
GOoD come out of what seems like an apparent negative experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we reflect on today’s readings, we see signs of GOD’s
GOoDness.  The passage from the Acts of the Apostles shows us that out of the
persecution of the early believers, the Church grew.  Yesterday we heard about
the persecution of the early Christians by Saul.  We also reflected how that
turned out to be a blessing for the early believers as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>persecutor Saul becomes St. Paul the Apostle.  Today we see
what effect St. Peter had in the lives of people.  Peter speaks the following
healing words to Aeneas, a crippled and paralyzed man:  “Aeneas, Jesus Christ
heals you.”  It is not Peter who heals.  The GOoDness, health, and well- being
(salus) comes from Jesus.  As a result of this healing, many turned to the Lord
Jesus and experience eternal salus  (salvation).  We also hear how Peter was
instrumental in GOD’s raising of Tabitha (Dorcas - Gazelle)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from the dead.  And through it, many more came to believe in
the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to do GOoD for us.  Our response, as today’s
psalm indicates, is to say to GOD, “O LORD, I am your servant.”  We are called
to service – ministry.  This is a calling all of us have because of our being
disciples and servants of the Lord Jesus.  And the way we serve (and return to
the LORD what GOD has given to us) is by taking up the Cup of Salvation and the
Bread of Life – Jesus’s own Blood and Body that He gives us as our food and
nourishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The verses from today’s section of Jesus’ Bread of Life
discourse have always touched my heart.  Jesus has just finished telling the
crowds that they must eat His Body and drink His Blood.  Some people start to
leave, saying, “This saying is hard, who can accept it?”  What strikes me is
that Jesus does not call back those who are leaving.  He does not say, “Oh, I
was only speaking figuratively.  You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>don’t really have to eat My Body and drink My Blood.”  Jesus
lets them go.  If they cannot accept His invitation and command to feast on His
very Body and Blood – the Bread of Life and the Cup of Salvation – then</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus does not want them to follow Him, because they are not
believing in one of the most important aspects of His teaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus then addresses the Twelve and ask them if they also
want to leave.  Peter speaks up and says, “Master, to whom shall we go.  You
have the words of eternal life.  We have come to believe and are convinced that
You are the Holy One of GOD.”  Peter realizes that he </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the other apostles must accept all of Jesus’ teaching
since He is the One Who has been sent by GOD, His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father.  Whatever Jesus says is Truth, even the need to
eat His Body and drink His Blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ giving of Himself to us as the Bread of Life is just
another GOoD thing which GOD has done for us. We need to continue to “offer
sacrifice of thanksgiving to GOD and call upon the name of the LORD.”  We need
to come to the Master and feast upon Him and be willing to serve others as
servants of the LORD GOD.  I am reminded of this during the pandemic that
struck the world for years, since we were not always able to gather physically
at the Table of the Lord Jesus and feast on His Body and Blood.  During the
time we are not allowed to gather at churches, I missed being able to celebrate
Eucharist and receive Communion with other believers.  I thank GOD that now we
are generally able to return to the Table of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our journey back to the house of our Abba,
Who happens to be GOD, we need to stop and to reflect on the GOoD that GOD has
done for us.  GOD has touched our lives, even during the most trying times. GOD
provides for us and brings us healing in the midst of pain and sickness.  GOD
feeds us as we hunger for Truth and Life, because Jesus is the Truth and the
Life.  Jesus raises us up when we are dead.  Let us make a return to the Lord
Jesus for all the GOoD GOD has done for us by taking up the Bread of Life and
the Cup of Salvation, and also by being servants of the Lord Jesus and servants
to GOD’s Holy People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What GOoD things has
GOD done for me recently? How have I given a sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving back to GOD? How am I nourished as I journey along my way back to
GOD? How can I help others be open to the GOoDness of GOD in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever gracious and always giving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You constantly do GOoD for us.  We often fail to see
Your GOoDness manifested in the little events of our lives.  We expect
outstanding miracles and miss the minor signs of Your presence and healing.  May
we take the time to reflect on how You have touched our lives each and every
hour of each and every day.  May we take up the Cup of Salvation and give You
thanks by calling upon Your name and the name of Your Son, Jesus.  In His name
we have salus – healing, wholeness, and salvation.  It is He Who is the Bread
of Life, Which/Who nourishes us and strengthens us for our journey to You. 
Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, open our eyes, our minds, and our hearts
to see, to understand, and to love Your GOoDness.  May we offer You a return by
our service of those who need to be reassured of Your loving presence.  In the
name of Jesus we make this prayer, for He is our Master and Teacher, Who has
given us an example of loving service, and Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!

<p class=MsoNormal>Fourth Sunday of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Ignatius of Laconi:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 13: 14, 43-52;      Psalm 100: 1-2, 3,
5;        Revelation 7: 9, 14b-17;                  John 10: 27-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A relationship with GOD leads to care of others.  In the
First Reading, St. Paul begins his ministry to the Gentiles (obviously flowing
from his experience of a relationship with the Lord Jesus).  The psalm
reiterates that we belong to GOD, just as sheep have a relationship with the
shepherd, and, therefore, the LORD will take care of us.  The vision in the
selection from the Book of Revelation portrays the heavenly liturgical
celebration of the Lamb Who sits on the throne.  In the Gospel, Jesus describes
the oneness He has with His Abba-Father that leads Him to continue to care for
the flock that His Abba has entrusted to Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s passage in the Acts of the Apostles is a turning
point for Luke.  The emphasis of the book switches from St. Peter and the
original Apostles to St. Paul and his companions. There is also a change from
ministry primarily with those who are Jews or who are leaning toward Judaism,
to a concentration on the spread of the GOoD News to the Gentiles of all
nations.  We hear part of Paul’s first prolonged sermon in Antioch in Pisidia
(central part of modern Turkey).  Paul announces that GOD had first offered the
message of salvation to those who practiced Judaism, but now that message is
being proclaimed not only to Jews and to those interested in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judaism, but to all people.  Obviously, the Gentiles rejoice
in this announcement, while the strict Jews are offended by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul’s message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial reminds us that all those who develop a
relationship with GOD are sheep of GOD’s flock.  We belong to GOD and with that
bond comes GOD’s protection and gifts.  That relationship should lead to the
joyful praise of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The glimpse of heaven, that is presented to us today from
the Book of Revelation, enables us to have an experience of the eternal
celebration of praise that will take place.  The heavenly worship will be
celebrated by an innumerably large crowd of people from every place and time. 
Those participating will be wearing the white robes that they received when
they were baptized into the death (blood) and resurrection of the Lamb
(Jesus).  It is not just those who are martyrs (suffered death as a result of
their relationship with the Lord Jesus), but all who have given witness to
their relationship with the Lamb by their way of living.  It is the Lamb Who is
the center of the worship and who provides for all the flock gathered around in
praise.  It will be a time of profound joy and peace, when there will be no
sadness or pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Fourth Sunday of Easter (in all three liturgical cycles)
has readings from the tenth chapter of John’s Gospel which focuses on the role
of Jesus as the Shepherd. He truly is the GOoD Shepherd (Pastor Bonus). 
Today’s pericope deals with the unity that exists between Jesus and His Abba
and that flows out to the flock that His Abba has entrusted to Him.  It is
because Jesus is one with His Abba that He is certain of who the sheep are to whom
He ministers.  He tends the flock exactly as His Abba wills because He knows
His Abba’s plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me about the readings today is that a
relationship with GOD leads to the joyful care of others.  Jesus was very much
aware of that.  Because He was in complete and perfect relationship (oneness)
with His Abba, He ministers to the needs of all those whom He has been sent to
serve.  This is not just a single experience of ministering, but a life-long (a
life-giving and joy-filled) mission He has.  And it does not end here on earth
with His death and resurrection and ascension.  His sense of loving service,
that takes Him to the cross and from the grave, flows into the next life where
He, as the Lamb on the throne, continues to bestow blessings and joy on those
who have made a commitment to Him and have clothed themselves in the white
robes.  The faithful hear His voice and follow Him, giving Him</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>eternal worship as He shares the heavenly blessings with
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also challenged by the First Reading.  Not only am I to
have a relationship with Jesus, the Lamb of GOD, and His Abba, I am also
entrusted to be a witness (martyros) to that relationship by joyfully  announcing
the GOoD News to others.  The first and most important way that I am called to
proclaim the Gospel (GOoD News) is by tending the part of GOD’s flock that GOD
has entrusted to me.  I am to serve those whom GOD has placed in my life.  At
times, my words and actions, like Paul’s in today’s selection from Acts, may be
confronting to some and comforting to others.  I may face rejection by those
not open to GOD’s Truth, but mostly likely, I will also sense the joyful
feeling of others who are excited about the message of salvation that flows
from the Lamb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can only be faithful to the relationship I have with the
Lamb and His Abba by tending to those to whom GOD is allowing me to minister. 
And conversely, I can only minister to GOD’s flock if I am in relationship with
the Lord Jesus and continually seek to do GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, the first priority has to be to serve and to give
witness to the members of my immediate family, and then my church family.  The
best way I can proclaim GOoD News to them is by being a servant-leader. I must
model the role of shepherding by tending to their needs and protecting them and
guiding them along the Way of the GOoD Shepherd. At times I may have to speak
challenging words, but it should always be done in a loving, joy-filled, and
caring manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also called to minister and serve those with whom I
come in contact during my daily activities whether that be in my home, my faith
community or in my work environment, or even in casual encounters. Yes, it may
sometimes demand that I speak up, but more often I will be called to be a
witness by what I do.  I recall the words of St. Francis of Assisi who told his
followers: “Preach the Gospel at all times; and – if necessary – use words.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I tend to those whom GOD allows me to encounter along my
life journey, and I help them experience the love of the GOoD Shepherd, then I
will be able to join the eternal praise of the Lamb, not just in the future in
heaven, but right here and now.  That means that I must seek to see every
person as, at least potentially, part of the flock of GOD.  I must joyfully
serve them as belonging to GOD.  I must not be their judge, even though I may
be called to challenge their actions.  It may be that my loving care of them
will help them draw closer to the GOoD Shepherd and be part of the innumerable
crowd who will praise the Lamb and His Abba, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
in the eternal celebration of heaven.  It is then that I can echo the words of
the psalmist today and say: “Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; serve
the LORD with gladness; come before the LORD with joyful song.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced the loving care of the GOoD Shepherd, either directly or through
the means of others who shepherd His flock? What was it like to know that GOoD
Shepherd and His assistant shepherds were there to help, challenge, and protect
me?  To whom has the GOoD Shepherd called me to help lead and guide?  How has
my relationship with the Lord Jesus empowered me to be more loving and caring
of those whom GOD has entrusted to me?  Who might benefit from my pastoral
(shepherding) care today, this week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Abba.  Through Your
GOoDness, You sent Your Son to be Your sacrificial Lamb and the GOoD Shepherd
of Your flock.  He lived, ministered, suffered death, and rose in loving service
of You and for the sake of all Your flock.  You desire that all people turn
from their lives of sinfulness and actively and joyfully participate in Your
worship and the worship of Your Lamb.  In order to continue His acts of tender
loving care for Your flock, Jesus empowered His followers to further His
ministry by proclaiming Your GOoD News in word and action.  We thank You for
allowing us to not only be a part of Your flock, but also to shepherd that
portion of Your flock that You have entrusted to our care.  We have not always
been faithful witnesses and caring shepherds.  At times, we have failed to
reflect the love of the GOoD Shepherd.  For this we seek Your pardon and
forgiveness.  We ask that You continue to make us mindful of the gifts that You
have bestowed upon us through Your Holy Spirit.  Inspire us and makes us
joyfully enthusiastic in our care of Your flock.  We pray that we may join the
eternal worship of You, the Lamb, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for You are
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen. Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of the Fourth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus or St. Pancras)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Pancras  / Sts. Nereus and Achilleus:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Acts 11: 1-18;         Psalm 42: 2-3; 43: 3,
4;          John 10: 1-10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading relates St. Peter’s entering the home
of Gentiles and eating with them. Up until this point, all the Christians were
either Jews or converts to Judaism. Peter defends his action by relating a
vision he had and another vision that a Gentile had. This is a third
“Pentecost” in that the Holy Spirit is being given to the Gentiles. [The first
Pentecost was to the Jews in Jerusalem; the second was to Jews and Samaritans
in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today reminds us that what the center of our life
should be – searching to know and follow GOD more and more. That is where true
peace and happiness can be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today is the first part of the section from St.
John’s Gospel verses about the GOoD Shepherd, of which we heard later verses
proclaimed yesterday. Today Jesus tells us that as the GOoD Shepherd, He calls
His sheep, and they listen for His voice and follow Him. He is also the Sheep
Gate, that which (Who) protects the sheep within the sheep pen and also lets
them out to find safe pasture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize how often those
called to leadership and positions of authority get caught up in the wrong
ideas of what leadership is all about. Leadership means doing whatever is
necessary so that those who are being led can arrive safely at their
destination and can be provided for by the leader. The leader must be willing
to do anything for the sake of those being led, as long as it fits into GOD’s
plan. St. Peter found</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this out in the First Reading. In his vision, he saw
something like a large tarp being lowered down before him. In the canvas there
were many animals that were considered to be unclean for Jews, and therefore,
unfit to be eaten.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Peter is told to slaughter and eat the animals. Being the
“faithful Jew” that he was, Peter refused to eat the “unclean” food. In
response he was told, “What GOD says is clean, is okay to eat.” Typical for
Peter, being told this once was not enough. He had to hear it three times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About the same time a Gentile (non-Jew) had a vision of a
man named Simon Peter coming to him so that he and his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>household might have salus (healing, salvation). When Peter
does arrive and starts to teach, the Holy Spirit is made manifest and bestows
the divine gifts on the Gentiles, just as the Holy Spirit had done on the
Apostles on Pentecost. Peter finally understands his vision of GOD telling him
to eat the unclean animals. When GOD bestows the divine gifts on people,
whether they are Jews or Gentiles, they are part of GOD’s Chosen and Holy
People, part of GOD’s family. The relationship with GOD is what is important,
not adherence to some particular set of rules and regulations. Those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>called to lead must seek to draw others into a closer
relationship with GOD and not put roadblocks in the way of that relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar way, Jesus, in today’s Gospel, says that He is
the Sheep Gate. In the time of Jesus, shepherds would bring their sheep into something
like a corral or pen at night. It was an enclosure with an opening. The
enclosure would protect the sheep from wild animals and thieves. The shepherds
would lead the sheep through the opening. One of the shepherds would then sleep
in the opening of the enclosure and would be the “gate” to protect the sheep
from leaving and also prevent anyone or any animal from coming into the pen in
order to take the sheep. Obviously, if a thief wanted to steal the sheep, he
would have to climb over the walls of the enclosure rather than try to pass
over the human “gate” in the entrance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, the challenge for all of us is to look at our role as
sheep and our role, if we have one, as shepherds-leaders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are we at peace knowing that Jesus, the GOoD Shepherd, is
laying down His life to protect us. He guards the entrance so that no one will
come in to take us and also to prevent us from wandering away from His safety
during the darkness of night. We can rest, having been assured that Jesus is
with us and He is guarding us. He is aware of any dangers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that might try to sneak over the safety He provides. Thus,
He protects us from harm, even to the point of laying down</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His life for His sheep - that is, us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secondly, if we are in the position of being a leader,
whether that be at home, at school, at work, at church, or anywhere else, we
need to see how we are leading. Do we know the people who have been entrusted
to us? Are we interested in their well-being as much as we are in getting the
job done? Are we true leaders, that is, do we walk in such a way that invites
others to follow? Do we set an example of what must be done and how to do it?
Are we willing to lay down our lives for the sake of those whom we are leading,
or would we rather “sacrifice” one of our flock, so that we don’t have to face
the dangers of ravenous wolves or thieves? Do we stand guard to protect those
entrusted to our care? And are we imitators of the GOoD Shepherd and His way of
leading the flock?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, the readings challenge us to look at what is the
driving force behind our behavior. We are called to seek first the relationship
with GOD (our own relationship and others’ relationship with GOD). That has to
have a higher priority than rules and regulations. In seeking that relationship,
we will follow the lead of our GOoD Shepherd – we will get to know His voice
and allow Him to come into our lives. And if we are given the privilege of
leadership, we will imitate the GOoD Shepherd and seek the well-being of those
whom we are called to lead. And we will only lead in a way that leads to the
one GOoD Shepherd Who seeks to have all in the one flock. We will not feel
threatened by the true leadership of others who are also seeking to lead others
to the one flock of the one GOoD Shepherd. And we will pray for the unity of
all the sheep under the perfect leadership of Jesus, “The GOoD Shepherd.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When I think of the
flock of the Lord Jesus, where do I see myself? Am I a peace-filled member of
the flock who follows the lead of the GOoD Shepherd, or am I the wayward sheep
who goes my own way and gets lost? Do I see myself as a thief trying to snatch
others away from the care of the GOoD Shepherd?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do I pattern my leadership on that of the GOoD Shepherd Who
is willing to lay down His life for the sheep? Am I willing to be a shepherd
who will guard all those who are in the flock? How can I more faithfully
shepherd and care for those whom GOD places in my care?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the One Who is ever desiring a
closer relationship with us. Through Your GOoDness, You have given us Your Son
as our GOoD Shepherd. In His life and ministry, He wanted only one thing: that
we become united with Him and with You and the Holy Spirit. He continues to
seek our GOoD and wants to lead us to the best pasture where we will enjoy the
fullness of life that You have in store for us. He protects us from those who
would do us harm and is willing to lay down His life for us. We have not always
listened to the voice of the GOoD Shepherd, but we have listened to false
shepherds who offer false promises and who lead us astray. Yet, Your Son, the
GOoD Shepherd, continues to search us out as we stray from the one flock. We
come as sheep in need of the GOoD Shepherd. We also pray for those among us
whom You have called to be leaders and shepherds in the name of the GOoD
Shepherd. We ask that they may truly imitate the devotion and sense of service
that the GOoD Shepherd has for the sheep. May all who take on leadership roles
realize their blessed privilege in being able to lead others to the GOoD
Shepherd. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, our GOoD Shepherd, Who is
our personal leader and Who has given His life for us, the members of His
flock, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of the Fourth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of Our Lady of Fatima)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Lady of Fatima:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 11: 19-26;         Psalm 87: 1b-3, 4-5,
6-7;          John 10: 22-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD works in strange ways.  It seems like there have often
been difficult times for those who believe in GOD.  Sometimes it is from
non-believers, sometimes it is from other so-called believers who do not
understand how GOD works and who try to control how GOD works.  We see examples
of these in our readings today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading we hear about the continued persecution
of the earlier believers.  Because of this, the GOoD News starts to be preached
to non-Jews.  Many Gentiles come to believe and the early leaders of the
Church, like Barnabas, begin to see how GOD can work in the lives of non-Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm builds on this theme with the refrain:  “All you
nations, praise the LORD.”  It is not just the Jewish people, but all who come
to believe in GOD who are called to praise GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today Jesus continues the theme of the GOoD
Shepherd.  He reassures us that those who hear the voice of Jesus, the GOoD
Shepherd, will follow Him and He will give them life – eternal life.  And He
reminds those who hear Him that no one can snatch them away from Himself and
His Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we face trying times in the world, we can be strengthened
by knowing that GOD will see us through. This</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should motivate us to seek the Lord Jesus, especially as we
have experienced trying times in the last few years with civil unrest, global
tensions, earthquakes, droughts, flooding, the world-wide illnesses.  Though we
may not understand what GOoD can come from worldly strife and division, pain
and suffering, we need to believe that GOD is in control, and GOD can make GOoD
come out of the wrong doings of humans, both within and outside of the
community of faith.  Some people may blame world leaders for not acting quicker
to prevent the worldwide spread of the Covid-19 virus or to stop Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine.  Some leaders may have acted wrongly in handling the
climate changes and dealing with foreign nations and local situations of
shootings and other acts of violence.  But that is not to say that our focus
should be on the wrongdoings of some people,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>including those who have not fully heeded the directives
issued for the well-being of fellow humans.  That is not to say that we should
condone wrong doings, but we need to trust that GOD can give life and, as Jesus
says in today’s Gospel, no one will snatch away the sheep who belong to the
GOoD Shepherd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we look around, we need to realize that our community
(whether the world or the Church) is simul justus et peccator – “at the same
time, just and sinner.”  The Church is made up of humans with human failings –
sinners.  Yet, through our connection with the GOoD Shepherd, we are made just
and are given eternal life, or as it is said of Barnabas in today’s First
Reading:  “he rejoiced to see the evidence of GOD’s grace/favor.” GOD is still
justifying (as only GOD can do) by pouring out the divine grace/favor on the
holy (yet sinful) people of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may ask the same question of Jesus that the people in
today’s Gospel asked, “How long are You going to keep us in suspense?”  We  want
to know why terrible, evil, and sinful things have been done by those who do
harm to others, even by those who are called to lead and shepherd.  We may want
to know when all the negative happenings will end.  We want to see how GOD is
going to fix the messes all around and we want GOD to do it – and do it now. 
Yet, we must not lose faith, and we must not doubt that GOD can make GOoD come out
of what is happening all around us. We also need to be honest and realize that
the sins of some members of the Church and of the world are not what the Church
or concerned individuals should have as their primary focus.  What is important
is that we listen to the voice of the GOoD Shepherd and follow Him.  That is
the only thing that can bring us life – eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will something GOoD come of all this evil we see in the
world? I believe it will.  What will it be? I don’t know.  Yet, my faith in GOD
our Abba-Father and in the GOoD Shepherd, all under the direction of the Holy
Spirit – that’s what keeps me going.  Someone recently commented that Jesus
chose twelve individuals to be His apostles.  Out of those twelve, one betrayed
Him; one denied Him three times; nine ran away and hid; only one was willing to
stand beneath the cross as Jesus hung dying.  Yet, after the coming of the Holy
Spirit, eleven of those original twelve went out and were willing to lay down
their lives for the flock of the GOoD Shepherd. What is important is not the
messenger but the Message, not the “bringer” of Truth, but He Who is Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do we need to do anything? By all means.  We need to pray. 
Pray for salus – healing, salvation, well-being. Healing for those who have
been scared and hurt by the sins of the world.  We need to pray for healing and
reconciliation of those who have been sinful or lacked concern for others.  We
should lift our prayers for all who are sick and seek healing of their souls,
as well as their bodies.  We should also seek to pray and work for healing of
our civil communities.  We need to pray for those who are called to continue to
shepherd the flock of the GOoD Shepherd and take care of all who live on this
earth.  We need to pray for an openness to the movement</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the Holy Spirit in all parts of the Church, from those in
authority all the way down to the least of all individuals.  We need to work
for the unity of the flock of the GOoD Shepherd.  We also need to edify,
comfort, and build each other up, reassuring each other of GOD’s love and our
care and concern.  We need to be the Body of Christ reaching out to other
members of the Body and to all peoples.  GOD has worked marvelous signs in the
past.  GOD will continue to work in strange and great ways in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How do I respond
to the evil that is present in the world? Do I condemn the sin (the sinful
action) and still show concern for the sinner, praying and working for the
sinner’s reconciliation?  How do I work for the GOoD of the flock of the Lord
Jesus, that includes all people? Am I doing all I can to build up the Body of
Christ and seek a working together of all the parts of His Body?  Am I open to
various ways GOD might be acting in my life and the lives of those around me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever wise and all knowing. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son as the GOoD Shepherd of souls to
bring all who listen to the voice of the GOoD Shepherd into the one flock.
Through Your Son, You have promised eternal life, healing, and salvation to all
who follow the GOoD Shepherd.  We know that we are simul justus et peccator –
at the same time, just and sinful.  We as individuals and as a whole are
sinners.  We have strayed from the GOoD Shepherd and have even caused harm to
other members of the flock.  We have turned our backs to the wrongs done to the
flock, pretending not to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, open our eyes so that
we can see as Jesus, the GOoD Shepherd, sees –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not condemning the sinner, but condemning the sin.  Help us
to open our ears so that we may clearly hear the voice of the GOoD Shepherd Who
calls us to follow Him, through the dark valley to verdant pasture beside a
restful stream.  We give You praise and thanks for continuing to challenge us
to grow into faithful members of the Body of Christ.  We make the prayer in the
name of Jesus, our GOoD Shepherd, Who calls us again and again to be His flock,
and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!   <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feast of St. Matthias</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Replacing Wed. of 4th Week of Easter)   saint-matthias</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 1: 15-17, 20-26;        Psalm 113: 1-2,
3-4,  5-6, 7-8;        John 15: 9-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Feast of Matthias.  Today’s First
Reading takes place between the Ascension of Jesus and Pentecost.  Since the
suicide of Judas Iscariot, the number of apostles dropped to eleven.  It is
decided that someone should be appointed to make the number of Apostles be
twelve again.  Two men are selected:  Joseph (a.k.a. Barsabbas, a.k.a. Justus)
and Matthias.  Lots are drawn and the one decided upon is Matthias.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is part of the Last Supper discourse (and is
specially chosen for the Feast of St. Matthias).  In today’s pericope, Jesus
commissions His disciples to keep His commandments, especially the commandment
of loving one another.  Jesus speaks about this key commandment and remarks
that no greater love does anyone have than being willing to lay down one’s life
for another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus in today’s Gospel also reminds us that the choice of being
His disciple and apostle is not the choice of the one who takes on this role. 
It is Jesus Who has first chosen the person for this privilege and
responsibility. Both GOD’s gift and GOD’s election start the process.  This is
what raises the chosen ones from the role of slave to that of servant-friend. 
The response of the one chosen is to be faithful to the calling that GOD has
given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings and feast of the day should speak to all who
desire a relationship with the Lord Jesus.  It begins and ends with GOD.  GOD
calls us to be in relationship.  Jesus picks us to be His disciples
(disciplined learners) who will sit at His feet and learn from Him.  The Holy
Spirit empowers us to be apostles (people “sent out” on a “mission”).   What an
awesome and privileged gift and responsibility we have been given – to be GOD’s
chosen ones.  It ends with our being one with Jesus, forever in the house of
His Abba-Father, Who happens to be GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once we accept this special relationship, this privilege of
learning from the Master and the mission we are asked to undertake, then we
will need to be martyrs (ìáñôõñïé – martyroi – “witnesses”) to what we have
experienced.  We need to live out the chief commandment that Jesus has given us
and demonstrated for us: loving one another as He has loved us.  That is the
witnessing to which we are called – loving one another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Loving one another is no simple thing of having
“lovey-dovey” feelings for everyone.  Loving one another is the willingness to
do whatever it takes to bring the GOoD News of Jesus Christ to others.  It
means being willing to be a servant- friend.  Jesus tells us that we are no
longer slaves, but friends – servant-friends.  A slave is under compulsion to
do the work for the master.  A servant-friend lovingly responds to the need of
the Master-Teacher.  The servant-friend wants to do whatever is necessary, so
the work and mission of the Master-Teacher-Friend is carried on.  The
servant-friend will treat others just like the Master-Teacher- Friend:  caring
for others, working for their best physical and spiritual interests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twenty-two years ago, on the day before the feast of St.
Matthias, I was reminded of what it means to be a servant-friend.  That day
(May 13, 2003) was a Tuesday.  After leaving the house at 5:20 a.m., attending
a Bible Study at 6:00 a.m., working at school from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., I
decided to leave school “early” to get home early for a change, since the night
before I had spent four hours</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>taking a friend to the emergency room at the hospital.  As I
prepared to leave school, I called the friend and could </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not get hold of the person.  I drove the 45-minutes to the
house of my friend and the person was not home.  I talked to neighbors and was
informed that an ambulance had taken the person away.  After a few more phone
calls, I discovered the hospital where my friend had been taken to the
emergency room.  I picked up the friend. We drove 45 minutes to the friend’s
doctor’s office.  The staff at the doctor’s office asked that I take the
individual to the local hospital and its emergency room.  After another four
plus hours, the friend was admitted to the hospital near the doctor’s office,
different from the hospital where the friend had been in the afternoon.  I
returned home at 10:30 p.m.  While I spent the hours waiting in the emergency
hospital, the friend kept saying, “Why are you doing this for me?”  I could
only respond that GOD had sent me to do whatever was necessary since this
friend did not have any relatives in California.  I was sent (“apostled”) to be
the servant-friend to this person in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the pandemic, we may not have been asked to take
friends to a hospital and sit with them in the waiting room for four hours. 
Instead, we might have been asked to pick up supplies for an elderly person who
could not get out or know how to have things remotely delivered.  We might have
been “chosen” to reach out online or through other social media to bring a word
of encouragement.  Prayer might have been our calling, as we lifted up to GOD those
who are in need of GOD’s protection and our prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So today, we are reminded that the Eleven Apostles realized
that they were being guided to continue the mission of Jesus.  They were led to
allow another person to complete their numbers so that the ministry of Jesus
would continue.  They were guided by the Holy Spirit to select one who could
give witness to the life and teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This same process continues today – the process of
recognizing the call of other witnesses, servant-friends, disciples, and
apostles.  It is the will of GOD to call and choose many others to be
witnesses, servant-friends, disciples, and apostles.  We should thank GOD for
this election process so that the ministry and mission of Jesus can continue
into the future.  We should give praise that we, too, have been chosen by GOD
to fulfill this special role of loving others as Jesus loves us.  This is our
calling, this is our election – elected by Jesus for role He wants us to do,
this is our mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   To whom am I
called to be a servant-friend today? How can I give witness to that person and
let them know that I am loving them because I have experienced the love Jesus
has for me? Can people tell by the way I treat them that I am disciple of the
Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever conscious of those whom You
have called.  Through Your GOoDness, You want others to share in the ministry
and mission of Your Son – to announce Your GOoD News.  You have given all
authority and power to Jesus so that His message will continue to the ends of
the earth and for all time.  He has chosen individuals who have experienced the
GOoD News in their own lives.  He commissions them to carry on His work by
giving witness to His unconditional love.  He has given us an example of love
by His willingness to lay down His life for others.  We thank You, LORD GOD,
for the way You have continued the spreading of the Gospel through the ages, by
calling others to the roles of disciples, apostles, and servant-friends. We
particularly express our gratitude for those who have shared their witnessing
and faith with us and enabled us to come to this point in our journey to You. 
We ask that You make us even more aware of the empowerment we have received
through the Holy Spirit, so that we can be witnesses of Your love to others. 
May we always come to our Master-Teacher-Friend and learn even more from Him as
He teaches us and commissions us to announce the GOoD News that He has received
from You and passed on to us.  May we realize even more fully the fact that You
have called us and chosen us to share in the ministry and mission of Your Son,
Jesus.  May</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we give witness to all that we have received from You, Your
Son, and the Holy Spirit.  May our lives reflect the love You have given, so
that others may accept Your gift of love.  We make this prayer in the name of
the Lord Jesus, Your Son, our Master-Teacher-Friend, our Savior, Who has called
us as witnesses, disciples, apostles, and servant-friends, and Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of the Fourth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Isidore)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Isidore the Farmer:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 13: 13-25;       Psalm 89: 2-3, 21-22, 25
and 27;        John 13: 16-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings remind us that Jesus is the pivotal point in
history.  Jesus came as the fulfillment of all the Hebrews scriptures, and He
is the beginning of all that lies in store for us.  We also reflect on the fact
that Jesus was sent by His Abba-Father and He, in turn, sends out others to
continue His mission/apostolate of announcing the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s account from the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul
is on his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>missionary journey.  He addresses a crowd of Jews and
“GOD-fearing” individuals (non-Jews who have come to the synagogue to learn
more about GOD and who desire to have a relationship with GOD).  Paul asserts
that all of Israelite history has been leading up to the coming of Jesus, the
Christ,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the savior of the world.  [John is John Mark, traditional
understood to be the author of the Gospel of Mark.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes part of Paul’s words in the First Reading. 
(Actually, Paul was quoting part of this psalm.)  The psalmist praises GOD for
choosing David and giving David power to lead the people, all for the greater
glory of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, that takes place on the night before Jesus
dies, Jesus reminds His disciples that He has come as the Master Who serves. 
Just as Jesus has washed the feet of His followers, so they must be willing to
serve others.  Jesus also creates a link between His followers and Himself that
parallels the link Jesus has with His Abba.  The concept of being sent
(“apostled”) flows from Jesus’ own sense of mission/being sent by His Abba.  It
is a continued tradition (“handing down”) of authority.  Jesus has been fully
empowered by GOD, His Abba, and now Jesus empowers His disciples to be apostles
(“those who are sent”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am edified and uplifted by the readings today.  I see that
each one of us, as the modern disciples of Jesus, are part of the salvific plan
of GOD.  GOD has control over history.  The Hebrew scriptures prepared the
world for the coming of Jesus, the Savior Who is the Christ - the Anointed One
of GOD.  The Word of GOD, as spoken through the patriarchs and prophets,
focused on the time when GOD would save the people.  (Remember Jesus [Yeshua]
means “GOD saves.”)  GOD’s plan was to send the Son with the mission and the
ministry of announcing salvation and bringing it about through His own death
and resurrection.  The plan has not been limited only to the thirty-something
years that Jesus walked on this earth in His human body.  It reaches out from
that key moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plan includes sharing the mission and ministry by
“apostling” (sending out) others to continue the proclamation of the divine
message of salvation.  We are doubly privileged.  Not only have we heard the
message through the human voices of those who came before us in faith, but we
are also being given the opportunity to announce the same message to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main way we are called to preach the GOoD News is
addressed in today’s Gospel.  We are called to be servants, just as Jesus
served.  We are called to be  willing to “wash the feet” of others.  This
“washing of the feet” can take many forms.  It can be our unconditional love
for our family demonstrated by our doing our regular routine tasks with a
cheerful heart.  It can be the way we treat those with whom we work (or have
worked in the past).  It can be, as I have learned from the experiences of the
last three decades, the caring for a sick and/or aged person who needs our
help.  We can “serve others” by simply smiling at a person whom we encounter in
our daily activities, including associating with others via social media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever we are willing to think of others before ourselves,
(while not letting ourselves be walked on or run over), it is then that we are
imitating our Master Who came to serve and not to be served.  From our serving
others and sharing the GOoD News with them (first in actions), people should be
able to see our relationship with our Master, just as Jesus revealed His
relationship with His Abba by His acts of loving service and His words.  If we
can do that, then the words of today’s psalm will resonate through our very
being:  “The favors of the LORD I will sing forever; through all generations my
mouth shall proclaim Your faithfulness.  For You have said, ‘My kindness is
established forever’;  in heaven You have confirmed Your faithfulness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What will I do
today to demonstrate that I am a servant of the Lord Jesus as I interact with
those whom I encounter? How can I be more of a loving servant with a particular
member of my family, a specific co-worker, or a person who crosses my path
today (even if it is only online)? What can I do to encourage others to
proclaim the GOoD News by the way they serve the people around them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have always wanted to share Yourself with mortals, whom You made
in Your own image and likeness.  We have not always understood Your willingness
to care for us, even though You have proclaimed Your message through the
prophets of old.  In the fulness of Your time, You sent Your Son as the
Incarnation of Your loving service.  Jesus came as the Master Who serves and
saves.  Jesus has empowered those who accept His gift of salvation to be
co-workers with Him</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the process of proclaiming Your love.  We thank You for
those who answered the call and shared with us Your GOoD News.  We also are
grateful for Your allowing us to be a part of furthering the Gospel message by
our loving service of others, always pointing back to our Master and His
relationship with You.  It is in the name of Jesus, our Master and Your
Servant, that we make this prayer.  For He is not only our role model of caring
and loving, but also He has brought us Your salvation through His own death and
resurrection.  To You be all glory and honor and praise in and through Your
Son, Jesus, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 16, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of the Fourth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Margaret of Cortona</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 13: 26-33;      Psalm 2: 6-7, 8-9,
10-11ab;       John 14: 1-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The relationship between Jesus and His Abba-Father takes
center stage in today’s readings.  In the First Reading, St. Paul refers to
Psalm 2 to show that Jesus is the fulfillment of GOD’s Promised Word to send
One Whom GOD calls “the Son.”  In the Gospel, Jesus also speaks of His
connection with the GOD Whom He call His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul speaks to the people of Antioch in Pisidia (in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>modern Turkey).  He summarizes the paschal mysteries of
Jesus’ suffering, death, and resurrection.  He shows how these events fulfill
the Hebrew scriptures (Old Testament) and reveal the close relationship between
Jesus and His Abba, Who is GOD.  He quotes Psalm 2 (which is the psalm of the
day):  “You are My Son; this day I have begotten You.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today is taken from Jesus’ discourse with His
disciples at the Last Supper.  Today Jesus speaks about preparing a place for
His followers in His Abba’s house.  He tells His disciples that He is the Way,
the Truth, and the Life and that no one can come to the Abba except through
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is not only a prophet (spokesperson for GOD);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is not only the suffering servant (cf. Isaiah’s four
passages about the Suffering Servant:   https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/
Servant_songs); but also, He is the Son of GOD Who has an intimate relation
with His Abba Who is GOD.  Jesus is constantly aware of His relationship with
His Abba.  He knows that He is called to do the will of His Abba and lead His
followers into a closer relationship with His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is thus that Jesus is upset because Thomas and the other
disciples do not fully understand His mission and purpose.  They do not
understand that He has come to bring them to the dwelling place He is preparing
for them in His Abba’s house.  He tries to get this across to them by saying
that He is the Way to the Abba and that no one can come into a deep, intimate
relationship with GOD unless they come to the intimate relationship through
Him.  He also emphasizes that all other information about GOD, His Abba, is
second to what He has come to share because He is the Truth.  Finally, Jesus says
that any other purpose in life is unimportant unless it is tied to Him, since
He is the Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am challenged by the readings today, because I do not
always focus on Jesus as much as I should.  Oh, I know in my head that Jesus is
the Way, the Truth, and the Life, but I do not always live it out in my life. 
If I really believe in my innermost being that Jesus is the Way, the Truth,  and
the Life, my life would be centered even more fully on Jesus and the
relationship with His Abba that He has come to share with me, and with you.  If
I firmly had trust in Jesus, I would not worry about my problems, but come and
sit at the feet of the Master-Teacher and learn from Him.  I would keep my eyes
focused on Jesus, for He is the Way.  I would reflect on His words, for He is
the Truth.  I would live a Christ-centered existence because He is the Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, being so wound up in my own concerns, I miss out on
what my relationship with Jesus and His Abba could be.  I settle for less
because I don’t fully trust the Lord Jesus; it is not that I don’t want to, but
I let other things get in the way.  I put too much emphasis on the wrong
things.  I can relate to Thomas.  I, too, ask the wrong question.  I repeat
Thomas’ question:  “I don’t know where You are going, Jesus; how can I know the
way?”  If I would just open my eyes and ears, I would realize that Jesus’s way
is simple:  He is heading back to His Abba and He wants us to come along. 
After all, He is the Way.   The understanding of Jesus is also simple, for He
is the Truth.  What I must do is also simple.  I just need to live like Jesus,
for He is the Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What in my life
keeps me from living out my belief in Jesus Who is the Way, the Truth, and the
Life? What can I do to more fully follow Jesus, the Way to the Abba?   What
element of the Truth do I need to accept and personalize and which I have been
reluctant to do? How can I live in a way that manifests Jesus as the source and
purpose of my life? How can I share Jesus, the Way, the Truth, and the Life
with others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever revealing.  Through Your
GOoDness, You want us to come into a closer, more intimate relationship with
You.  Since we get lost so easily and cannot find our way, You sent us the Way
– Your Son, Jesus.  Because we get confused with falsehoods and lies, You have
given us the Truth – Your Son, Jesus.  Because we make choices that lead to
death and destruction, You reassure us of Life – eternal Life – Life with You
and Your Son Jesus, for He is the Life.  You are overly generous in Your
dealing with us and giving us what we need:  the Way, the Truth, and the Life. 
All we can do is give You thanks and praise as we draw closer to You through
Your Son.  Continue to pour out Your Holy Spirit upon us so we can follow the
Way, learn the Truth, and experience the Life that You have given us.  We make
this prayer through the only means we have to You – through Your Son, Jesus,
the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of the Fourth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Paschal Baylon:   Readings:  Acts 13: 44-52;      
Psalm 98: 1, 2-3ab, 3cd-4;        John 14: 7-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of
GOD.”  These words from the Responsorial Psalm today speak of the manifestation
of GOD’s work.  It is something that flows out for all to see, yet all do not
see.  Some refuse to see.  Some do not fully understand and lack spiritual
insights.  GOD wants all to see and to give praise back to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading, Paul and Barnabas continue their
missionary journey into Asia Minor (modern Turkey).  After preaching in the
Jewish synagogue in Antioch, they are ousted by the Jews.  The Jews cannot see,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or they refuse to see, the truth of their own scriptures
that revealed the saving works in the person of Jesus. The Gentiles rejoice in
the message that Paul and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barnabas bring – the message of the saving works of GOD. The
disciples sense the joyful presence of the Holy Spirit. The saving works of GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are seen in more and more distant places and by people who
are not part of the Jewish faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Philip does not see clearly.  Philip
wants to see the Abba-Father.  Jesus had been with Philip and the other
disciples for quite some time, yet they failed to see Jesus clearly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus chides Philip for not seeing that Jesus and His Abba
are one and if you see (“understand”) Jesus and His mission, you see the Abba
and “understand” the will of the Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often we fail to see the saving power of GOD.  We think
we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>see what GOD wants us to see, but we are blind to GOD’s true
workings.  We only see what we want to see.  We close our eyes and minds to the
greater things that GOD is doing.  Jesus came that we might see and experience
the fullness of GOD, yet sometimes we shut our eyes to what GOD is revealing to
us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We think we see GOD’s plan, but what we see is through our
own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tinted glasses.  It colors the world with false colors.  We
become myopic and only have limited vision.  We want GOD to see things the way
we see things, and we are not willing to see things the way GOD sees them.  We
say such prayers as “GOD, help others to agree with me about. . .”  or “Lord,
open the eyes of those who disagree with me so that they will see clearly (what
obviously I already see clearly).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We should be listening to the words of Jesus, “take the beam
out of your own eye, so that you can see clearly to remove the splinter in your
kinfolk’s eye” (Matthew 7: 5).  If we really had the eyes of faith, we would
begin to see GOD’s plan in the life and ministry of Jesus.  We would come and
learn from the Master-Teacher. We would become disciplined learners who seek to
imitate our Master so that people would look beyond us to see the Master and
His saving works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a response to today’s reading, I sense that I am being
invited to spend more time with Jesus.  As I spend </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more time with the Master, I will see His Abba as I look at
the Master, and hopefully I will not hear the words Jesus addressed to Philip,
“Have I been with you for so long a time, and you still do not know Me?”  It is
in my spending time with the Master that I will get to “know” Him and His Abba,
that is, I will deepen my relationship with Jesus and His Abba, in the unity of
the Holy Spirit.  I will see the great signs that Jesus will do as I learn to
ask for the right gifts.  That’s the challenge before me today:  To see Jesus
and His Abba and feel the presence of the Holy Spirit – to see the saving power
of GOD that reaches out to the ends of the earth, beyond my limited scope.  It
takes a continued metanoia – a looking beyond my own mindset and a seeking to
put on the mindset of the Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How is my
spiritual vision? Do I seek to see how my Master-Teacher sees or do I want
Jesus to see things my way?  What items/ obstacles are blocking my vision and
preventing me from seeing as GOD would have me see? How can I help others to
see with the eyes of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all powerful and all knowing.
Through Your GOoDness, You reveal Your saving power through many signs and
wonders.  Of these the greatest is the incarnation of Your Son, Jesus.  He came
to reveal Who You are by allowing His followers to see Who He is.  As
Master-Teacher, He taught His disciples (disciplined learners) to draw ever
closer to Him and imitate Him in proclaiming Your love to others.  Through the
power of the Holy Spirit, help us to keep our eyes open to Your saving power as
manifested in and through Your Son, Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we give glory and praise to You as we continue to
experience Your marvelous deeds.  In the name of Jesus, we make this prayer,
for He is our Master and Teacher, Who has given us an example of loving
service, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen. Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 18, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifth Sunday of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John I:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 14: 21-27;     Psalm 145: 8-9, 10-11,
12-13;    Revelation 21: 1-5a;    John 13: 31-33a, 34-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a sense of transition in today’s readings. In the
passage from the Acts of the Apostles, Paul and his companions are completing
their missionary journey, concluding their work by setting up a way by which
the new faith assemblies can carry on without them.  The Responsorial reminds
us that even though things change, GOD’s reign will never end.  The Book of
Revelation assures us that GOD will create a new heaven and a new earth, for
GOD is in the process of making all things new.  Today’s Gospel takes place at
the Last Supper when Jesus issues a revised, but new commandment to His
followers before He physically departs from them, through His death on the next
day, and eventually after His resurrection and ascension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Paul and Barnabas wind up their first missionary journey,
they pass through some of the communities in which they have preached the GOoD
News.  In order that the churches can continue to be faithful to the Word that
they have shared with them, the two missionary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>preachers set up elders (presbyters - priests) to tend to
the needs of the communities. The two then return to Antioch, the place from
which they were commissioned (“sent out” - “apostled”).  There they give an
account of how GOD has opened the door so that the Gentiles could come into the
household of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today reminds us of GOD’s GOoDness and compassion
and exhorts us to respond to GOD’s mercy and kindness by giving thanks and
blessings to GOD since GOD is always in control and the divine rule and
dominion endures through all generations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s Second Reading is from the last part of the Book of
Revelation. In today’s pericope we hear the only words in the whole book spoken
by GOD (the Abba-Father). GOD proclaims, “Behold, I make all things new.” As
the end of time (as we know it) concludes and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>eternity begins, GOD renews the divine creation by
establishing a new Jerusalem, a new</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heaven, and a new earth.  This is the beginning of the
complete and everlasting reign of GOD. It will be a time of joy and rejoicing
as GOD is intimately united with those who do the divine will.  It is the
beginning of the eternal union of GOD and GOD’s beloved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus begins His final</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>discourse (John 13-17) with His eleven disciples on the
night of His hour of glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the climax of His mission on earth.  He has come to
give glory </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and honor to His Abba and His Abba will glorify Him as He
suffers, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dies, and rises.  Jesus’ words to His disciples are those of
establishing a </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>new commandment. Yes, it is patterned on words from the
Hebrew </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>scriptures, but there is a new emphasis.  The new
commandment is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love.  They are called not simply to show a deep liking for
those who </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are nice to them, but to love (αγαπατε – agapate) each other
just as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has loved them. Jesus has told them about this love
and has given </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them examples of His love.  He, their Master and Teacher,
has just finished demonstrating His willingness to serve them by washing their
feet (John 13: 1-20).  Later in His final words He will proclaim, “No greater
love does anyone have than to lay down one’s life for another” (John 15: 13). 
And the final act of His love will be demonstrated within a few hours as He
dies on the cross (John 18-19).  And the culmination of His loving service will
be His resurrection and ascension, and His giving of the Holy Spirit on Easter
Sunday (John 20). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am re-energized and renewed.
The imagery that comes to me as that of working in an enclosed space, where it
is hot and stuffy.  All of the sudden, someone opens a door, and a fresh, cool
breeze blows into the room bringing a restoring, fresh breath to all those who
are there. That is what today’s readings are: a fresh breeze (ruah - wind,
breath, Spirit) blowing in and renewing.  Paul was aware of it as he saw the
door of faith swing open to Gentiles to whom he preached.  Our passage from
Revelation refers to the newness that comes as GOD’s reign reaches its climax. 
There will be a new heaven and a new earth.  Jesus has come to establish the
new relationship between GOD and the people and among the people themselves.
GOD will be ever present among humans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That which renews is the love of GOD. GOD’s unconditional
love is the creative force that brings a total newness. Yes, there is a
continuum with what has happened, but there is also a newness in what GOD is
bringing to completion. We are at the point of transition from what has been to
what will be.  We are part of the new dominion of GOD, even though we have not
yet fully experienced it.  The bridge between all the great things GOD has done
and the ultimate and eternal reign of GOD is the bridge of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True love (agape) is not an emotion that makes us feel
happy. It is the sense of participating in the very essence of GOD.  It is that
which flows between and from the three persons of the Blessed Trinity. It is
the creative force that has brought existence to the universe. It is the very
gift of GOD’s being in us.  That love is what led to the Son’s becoming flesh
and dwelling among us and giving of His very life in ministry and death.  And
it is that love that we are called to communicate and share with others by our
own ministry (and ultimate death).  Yet death, as we continue to celebrate in
this Easter season, is not the end of the story.  Death is only the final
transition to the glory of eternal life and love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to renew the divine creation.  GOD is
revealing to us part of the process of making all things new.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can participate in this process by our loving one another
as Jesus has loved (and continues to love) us.  It means that we must manifest
that love by our care and service of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question we must constantly ask ourselves, in every
situation we find ourselves, is “How can I bring the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>newness of GOD’s life and love into this situation?”  We
must contemplate and put into action what it is that we can do to make GOD’s
presence felt by others (and by ourselves) in each circumstance.  It means we
must make decision that will not always be easy, but that will further GOD’s
reign over us and others.  We need to be aware of the fresh ruah (breeze, wind,
breath, Spirit) blowing into our stuffy lives and then help others to
experience that newness through our loving them.  When we do that, we will be
living out the words of today’s psalm: “Let Your faithful ones make known Your
might to the children of Adam [including all people], and the glorious splendor
of Your reign.  Your reign is a reign for all ages, and Your dominion endures
through all generations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today is:  What can I do to
bring the newness of GOD’s love into a particular situation? Is there a
situation today (this week) that can be renewing by my acting in a more loving
way?  Who needs to experience a sense of renewal that I can help bring about by
my loving him/her/them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Ruler of all places and times. 
Through Your GOoDness You continue to renew Your reign as Your manifest Your
love for all Your creatures.  In the fullness of time, You sent Your Son,
Jesus, into this world to reveal Your love by His sharing in our human life,
living among us, ministering to others, teaching and instructing them, and
serving their needs.  As a final demonstration of love, He willingly accepted
death, death on the cross, in order to give You glory and praise.  As He
prepared for His death, He commanded His disciples to do as He did – to love
one another.  We thank You for allowing us to share in the ministry of Your Son
and to proclaim Your GOoD News by our loving those whom You have placed along
our paths to You.  May we help to renew Your creation by our loving service of
others, hastening the time of Your final establishment of the new heaven and
the new earth which will be marked by a sharing in Your complete love.  For the
times we have failed to love others as we have been loved, we ask for Your
forgiveness and pardon.  Continue to breathe Your Spirit into our lives so that
we can bring a freshness to the ministry You give us.  And to You, Your Son,
and Your Holy Spirit, may all glory, honor, and praise be given, now and
forever.  Amen.  Alleluia! <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of Fifth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Theophilus of Corte:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 14: 5-18;       Psalm 115: 1-2,  3-4,
15-16;        John 14: 21-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The theme that strikes me from today’s readings comes from
the psalm refrain:  “Not to us, O LORD, but to Your name give glory.”  St. Paul
and St. Barnabas today both realized that the GOoD that they are doing is not
to be attributed to them, as the people of Lystra wanted to do, but to the one,
true GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus, although He could take glory for what He is
doing, passes on the glory to His Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul and St. Barnabas meet all
types of reactions as they make their journey through Asia Minor (modern day
Turkey).  In Iconium (modern Konya), they are rejected by both the Jewish
people and the Gentiles. They journey on to Lystra where they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heal a crippled man.  The Gentiles in the town want to treat
them like Greek gods who have come to earth.  Paul and Barnabas point out that
they are only instruments in the hand of the one, true GOD.  They continue to
preach the GOoD News that comes not from the Greek mythological gods, but that
comes from the one and only GOD.  It is that GOD Who deserves all the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>glory and praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Jesus continues to speak to His
disciples on the night before He dies.  Jesus tells them that if they truly
wish to be His followers, then they must take to heart all that He has said,
especially the commandments of loving and serving one another.  If they do
this, Jesus and His Abba will love them and make the divine dwelling place
within them.  They will have GOD in them – they will be enthusiastic (en –
“in”, theu – “GOD”).  Jesus points out that what He has said and done has not
been for His own sake, but because He is doing what His Abba wants Him to do. 
Jesus also promises that He will send the Holy Spirit as “the advocate” or
“paraclete.”  This is a legal term that means “one who is an advisor on
matters.” or “one who defends.”  The Holy Spirit will continue the teaching and
the informing of the disciples so that they will be even more “enthusiastic” as
they come to know more fully what it means to have GOD within them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has chosen to work in and through us, humans.  After
having shared with us the divine message – the GOoD News – GOD ask us to
continue to reflect on it and then pass it on to others.  As we share the GOoD
News, others may mistake the GOoDness and kindness that we extend to them as
being simply our gift to them, rather than what it truly is – a gift from GOD. 
They may try to give thanks to us.  We need to re-direct the gratitude – pass
it on – to the GOD to Whom it is due.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember going to workshops and talks by Christian
speakers who have truly motivated me and others.  The most “enthusiastic” of
them had the ability to take the appreciation of audience and pass it on,
humbly, to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember one such speaker (Fr. Richard Rohr) who would
constantly point up to heaven as the listeners showed their approval of his
words by their applause.  In his mannerism he would re-direct the praise where
it belongs – to GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, we (every one of us who believes in the GOoD News of
Jesus Christ) are called to take our faith and share it with others in action
and, if necessary, by words.  And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as people begin to accept the GOoD News and appreciate the
GOoDness that flows from the GOoD News, we must rejoice with them and pass on
their gratitude to the GOD Who is in us, working through us.  We should truly
be “enthusiastic” as we realize that GOD has made a dwelling place within us –
that Jesus, His Abba, and the Holy Spirit are motivating us from within.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is an awesome experience to sense the divine presence
within us as we proclaim the GOoD News to others.  We can rejoice that we are
instruments of the GOD Who dwells within us.  We can be pleased that we have
been useful tools for bringing the GOoD News to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others.  That should be enough for us.  All the real glory
and praise must be handed on to the Master Who has instructed us, to the One
Who has sent the Master, and to our Advocate Who continues to be the source of
our ongoing education and protection.  To GOD be all glory, praise, and honor –
the GOD Who has made the divine dwelling place in us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today is:  For what actions
do we seek to receive credit and glory that rightly belongs to the Lord Jesus,
His Abba, and the Holy Spirit? How can I humbly and realistically redirect
others to give the glory for the GOoD that I do, and redirect the praise to the
GOD Who works in and through me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all powerful.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continue to announce Your GOoD News to those who need to hear it
the most.  You, in Your infinite wisdom, have chosen to use human instruments
as the means of announcing Your love.  Jesus, Your Son, the GOD-Man, is the
ultimate messenger of GOoD News.  We thank You for sending Him to us.  You
wanted the divine message to continue after Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>returned to You in Heaven.  Thus, You have empowered Jesus’
disciples to continue the ministry of GOoD News. You have sent Your Holy Spirit
to be the Advocate, the Paraclete, the Advisor of all who would further the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spread of Your Gospel.  We thank You for making each of us
Your ambassador of Glad Tidings to others.  It is a joy to experience the
enthusiasm that comes from Your dwelling within us, empowering us to spread the
faith in which we continue to grow.  May we continue to pass on the faith to
others and the glory, praise, and honor to You, Your Son, and Your Spirit.  As
always, we make this prayer in union with Jesus, Your Son, our Master- Teacher,
our Savior, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of Fifth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Bernardine of Siena)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Bernardine of Siena:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 14: 19-28;         Psalm 145: 10-11,
12-13ab, 21;          John 14: 27-31a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, we hear St. Paul and Jesus both give “farewell”
addresses to their followers.  They do this to encourage those whom they will
leave behind, so that those left behind will be able to continue their journey
without the ones who have been their physical traveling companions on the
journey of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul speaks to the faithful in Asia Minor (modern
Turkey). He has started faith communities all around the region.  This was the
purpose of the mission which he had undertaken – to announce the GOoD News, to
get the assemblies (churches) started, and move on.  He is concluding his first
missionary expedition and heading back to the Christian assembly in Antioch who
had sent him on the journey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to hear the Last Supper Discourse in the
Gospel today, Jesus also speaks to those who have followed Him. He reminds them
of His mission – to be the GOoD News from His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father.  He is about to complete His earthly stay by
moving onto His hour of glory – His death, resurrection, and ascension.  He
wants to encourage His disciples not to become anxious or worried, but to
receive His gift of Shalom – Peace.  The Shalom that Jesus gives is not the
peace of which the world thinks – a time free from war and/or discord.  Rather
it is an inner sense of knowing that the work of GOD is continuing, and people
are being reconciled to GOD through the GOoD News of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, what strikes me is that we are
all traveling along a path that is constantly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>changing.  We are nomads or pilgrims journeying with
others.  There is constant changes in those who travel with us.  There may be
some who have been with us for quite a long time – members of our family,
longtime friends, etc.  Even they, however, will not always be our companions
along the whole way.  I am reminded of this as a close friend for over 40 years
died twenty-two years ago this month.  My friend and I had been “brothers” to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>each other and had helped each other over the course of four
decades.  I also recall my parents, as my father passed away twenty-one years
ago and my mother thirty-one years ago.  My friend and my parents have now
moved on to the next life, while I am still here journeying along, now without
these close “family” members physically being with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That could make me feel insecure and unstable.  We all want
some sense of stability.  Yet, life is ongoing and never stays in one place.  I
am reminded of another friend of mine (who has also passed on to the next stage
of life) who continually said, “that we are going to pass this point in our
lives only once.  We have never been exactly here before, nor will we be ever
here again.”  That is because we are pilgrim people, always journeying along
the way to our Abba Who happens to be GOD.  Yes, we may have been at this exact
longitude and latitude, but we are now in a different place in our faith
journey than we were the last time we were at this physical location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was talking to another friend, and we were talking about
the fact that we know where we are heading, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are not always sure of what will be around the next turn
in the road.  As Christians, we know that we are headed to be with GOD – we
are, as we say in Latin, ad Deum (or Spanish A-Dios or French A-Dieu –
“to/towards GOD”).  We even know the Way – Jesus.  What we are not so sure
about is:  how exactly we are to get there.  It would be nice if GOD would just
email or text us and say, “At the next fork in the road, I want you to take a
left.”  Or “I want you to travel with the next person you meet.”  Or “You will
be traveling along the path with this companion for a long time (or a short
time).”  The fact is, however, that GOD does not communicate the exact
directions for us to follow, nor can we go to  www.maps.net/yahoo-maps or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>www.mapquest. com/ or  www.google.com/maps/ nor is there
Google Heaven like there is Google Earth where we can see where we are going. 
We do not have an electronic GPS that gives us step by step turns.  Even though
GOD does give us the Way (Jesus), the unknown twist and turns will still be
there.  We do, however, have a divine GOD Positioning Savior (GPS) when we look
at Jesus, but we still have to make the moment by moments changes without
always knowing the exact turns, especially if we encounter sudden changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Quite a few years ago, I was talking with another friend who
purchased a vehicle with Global Position System, the first for him.  The GPS
was the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>type that had to download maps into the unit.  He found out
that even the GPS system he had in the vehicle was not as perfect as the more
modern GPS systems are today.  It did not know when roads were temporarily
blocked or when streets might have changed since the last time he downloaded
the map file.  But, as he found out, when he made changes not recorded in the
GPS system, the system got him back on target to travel to his ultimate
destination.  The system voiced or flashed on the screen, “Recalculating” and
then told him what must be done to get back on track to arrive at the
destination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, it is with GOD.  Our GOD Positioning Savior (GPS) helps
us get back on track when we have made changes in our journeying.  Jesus
“recalculates” after we have missed a turn or chosen a different path from the
one that GOD had planned for us.  GOD wants us to be on track toward our
ultimate destination with the Lord Jesus.  We can then experience the joy and
peace of being ad Deum – heading toward GOD and eventually in Deo (in GOD) or
cum Deo (with GOD).  As we go through the events of the last few years (with
pandemic, climate changes, civil and political unrest, war in Eastern Europe,
civil wars in places like Sudan), we are often unsure of where we are heading. 
But we have been given The Way as we travel along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus gives the disciples His Shalom.  He
tells them not to be distressed or fearful.  He knows that He will not
physically be walking beside them as He has for the last years in their shared
life on earth. Yet, He knows that He will be with them in and through His Holy
Spirit.  St. Paul also knows that he and those whom he has brought into the
family of GOD will always be united in the Spirit, even if they might not ever
see each other again on earth.  By our faith, we are also told not to be scared
during the troubling times we have experienced, because GOD will see us
through.  GOD is still with us.  We may have lost loved ones to the virus or
other causes of death, but we believe they are in the hands of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life is full of many twists and turns, lots of changes.  Yet
in and through the Spirit, we are united as we follow the Way.  We may have to
say farewell to some of our traveling companions – for a while – but those who
follow the Way will be re-united when we get to our final destination – the
house of our Abba-Father Who happens to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is it that I
fear most as I travel along toward the house of my Abba-Father Who happens to
be GOD? How can I bring the gift of Shalom not only to myself, but also to
others as we journey along the Way, especially when I have to say “farewell” or
A-Dios to some of my traveling companions? Is there some people who need to
receive the Lord Jesus’ gift of Shalom and with whom I can share that Shalom at
this moment on their pilgrim travels?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, never changing, yet always new.
Through Your GOoDness, You have given us a life that is not always straight and
flat. There are often twists and turns, hills and valleys. You want us to
arrive at the destination of Your House. It is then that we will finally be at
home. We thank You for giving us the Way – Your Son, Jesus. Jesus has gifted us
with His Shalom-peace, so that we will not be overly anxious, as we face the
unknown beyond the next turn. May we be aware that even if we have to say
farewell to some of our traveling companions, we will always be united in Your
Holy Spirit. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus Who is the Way to You,
and Who is our Master and Lord and Who is the Life and Resurrection and Who is
our GPS (GOD Positioning Savior) and Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia! <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Wednesday of Fifth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Cristóbal Magallanes and-companions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 15: 1-6;         Psalm 122: 1-2, 3-4ab,
4cd-5;        John 15: 1-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD gives growth to those who seek atonement (to be
at-one-ment) with the Lord Jesus. [I like this definition of “atonement” better
than the idea that we have to make up for our sinfulness. We are called to be
“At One” with our Triune GOD.  We can never “make up” for our sinfulness, but
we can seek At-One-ment with GOD.]  This at- one-ment may involve letting go of
the old, and being attached more fully to what is life-giving.  The First
Reading presents the struggle of the early Church in trying to incorporate
Gentiles into the Way (the name given to the early Church).  The struggle
involves whether the non-Jewish believers have to fully accept all of the old
practices of Judaism or whether they can be just grafted onto that which (Him
Who) gives life and thus produce a fruitful product of, and for, GOD.  The
Gospel uses the imagery of a vine dresser pruning the branches so that more
abundant fruit can be produced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage from the Acts of the Apostles, Paul and
Barnabas meet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>opposition when they return from their first missionary
journey.  Some of the members of the assembly in Antioch (the community that
had sent Paul and Barnabas on their journey) push for the full practice of
Judaism by the Gentiles who have become believers in Jesus.  As the dispute
arises, the faith community</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Antioch sends Paul and Barnabas and others to the
Christian leaders in Jerusalem.  It is exciting to hear, as Paul and Barnabas
travel through Phoenicia and Samaria and they share how the Gentiles have
accept the GOoD News, the believers in those areas rejoice in the GOoD fruit
that is being produced among the Gentiles.  The dispute, that concerns whether
the Gentiles need to fully practice Judaism, continues in Jerusalem as we will
hear in the days to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm 122 is a hymn sung by people on their way to Jerusalem,
the center of Judaism and birthplace of Christianity.  Going to Jerusalem was a
special event for people of faith.  (It continues to be today, even if it is a
little more dangerous, in some ways.)  It was also the seat of judgment for
Jews and for the early Christian believers.  It was the place to go in order to
ask GOD to reveal the divine will for believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the fifteenth chapter of St. John’s Gospel, speaks
about His being the true Vine Who gives life to the branches.  Jesus’ Abba-Father
is the Vine Dresser Who prunes the productive branches and removes the lifeless
branches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After hearing Fr. Richard Rohr, OFM a few years ago, my reflection
today comes from a sense of our being made in the image and likeness of the
creative GOD.  We know that from the Beginning (Genesis), GOD is creative –
producing life.  GOD spends “divine time” making light, the world, and living
creatures.  In John 15, Jesus portrays His Abba-Father as the Divine Vine
Dresser.  The job of the vine dresser is to prune productive branches so they
will bear more fruit and to cut away that which will not produce any fruit, but
it will rob the fruitful parts of branches from the much needed nutrients.
After the vine dresser has completed this work, the growth and production of
fruit depends upon the branches staying in contact with the vine.  This pruning
of the branches is not meant to be restrictive or punitive, but to be
life-giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have fond memories of traveling to my father’s house in
late winter/early spring to help him prune his grape vines.  His having grown
up as a farmer was evident as he taught myself and my other family members the
importance of pruning.  We would assist him as he cut away that which he knew
would not produce any growth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He would also cut some of the growth that was healthy, but
it needed pruning.  Then we would gather up the cut pieces and burn them.  I
also remember helping to graft some new shoots onto the healthy vine, so that
they could become a part of the growing vine.  Those experiences in the late
winter/early spring of the year helped me focus on today’s readings.  The
readings also give me a connection to the past and my time with my father who
is now enjoying the fruits of the heavenly Vine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are the branches.  We are called to bear fruit.  We
cannot bear much fruit unless we are pruned in order to bear a fuller growth
and produce abundant fruit.  We need some of our old self cut away and renewed
so we can receive more nourishment from the Vine and produce the richest
harvest possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also should rejoice as other branches are grafted on to
the Vine and begin to receive nourishment from the True Vine and produce GOoD
fruit.  For me in my work in the OCIA [Order of Christian Initiation of
Adults], it is truly a joy to see other branches being grafted on to the Vine
as people come to know the Lord Jesus and accept what He offers to them.  These
new branches begin to receive the flow of life from the bonding with Jesus, the
Vine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once we receive the flow of life from the Vine (Jesus), what
kind of fruit will we bear? We must do our best; we must work to our fullest
potential.  If we do that, others will benefit from our fruit.  They will be
blessed by the fruit of the Vine.  It is interesting when we speak about the
product that comes from the growth, we speak about the “fruit of the Vine,” not
the “fruit of the branches.”  The fruit we bear is truly the work of the Vine
and the Vine Dresser, not the product of the branches – us.  We, the branches,
must be the best vehicles for the life of the Vine to flow through us to
produce the fruit.  Yet the real source of growth comes from the Vine and the
work of the Vine Dresser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I think about this, I see a connection to what happened
in our world because of the pandemic of the last few years.  The crisis should
have caused us to ponder which aspects of our lives are really not bearing GOoD
growth.  I am not saying that those who were inflicted by the COVID-19 virus
(and any of its strains) are evil, or unfruitful.  I am saying what attitudes
and actions in my personal life need to be pruned out, so that I can bear more
fruit.  All of us have activities and attitudes in our lives that do not
promote positive growth.  Those need to be removed so we can be more fruitful
in our living out the GOoD News of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What in my life
needs to be pruned away so that I can bear more fruit? What is the fruit which
I produce and who is the primary beneficiary of my bearing fruit?  How can I
give better acknowledgment to the Vine (Jesus) as the source of my life-giving
nourishment and to the Vine dresser (the Abba)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Creator and Giver of life. 
Through Your GOoDness, You are the Vine Dresser Who prunes the branches so that
the branches become the means through which the Vine gives life to the fruit. 
We thank You for choosing us and pruning us, so we can see a richer harvest of
the fruit of the Vine.  We thank You also for those who have gone before us to
work in Your vineyard.  Many have worked with You, the Vine Dresser, to prepare
the ground, water, and tend the branches.  Yet, it is Your Son as the Vine
which/Who makes all growth possible. May we stay always united with the Vine
and receive the nutrients we need to produce the richest fruit.  May the fruit
of the Vine go forward to make the wine that enriches and brings joy to
others.  As always, we make this prayer in the name of Jesus, the Vine, Who is
our Master and Lord and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>May 22, 2025 <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of Fifth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Rita of Cascia) Readings can be obtained
from:   http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/052225.cfm Saint Athanasius      Readings: 
Acts 15: 7-21;        Psalm 96: 1-2a, 2b-3, 10;        John 15: 9-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Proclaim GOD’s marvelous deeds to all the nations.”  These
words from today’s Responsorial tie the readings together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading we hear St. Peter and St. James speak
about the spread of the GOoD News to the Gentiles.  St. Paul and St. Barnabas
are said to have shared the stories of their work among the non-Jews.  The
leaders of the early Church understand what Jesus meant when He commissioned
His followers to go out to all the world and share the GOoD News.  He was not
sending them to invite the Gentiles to become believers in Judaism, but to have
a relationship with the GOD of the Jews – the one and only true GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus in the Gospel today summarizes His ministry:  keeping
the commandments of His Abba-Father and inviting others to keep the new
commandments.  Those who choose to do this will have the joy of Jesus and that
joy will be complete.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s deeds are truly marvelous.  As Jesus reminds us today,
GOD wants us to have joy – Jesus’ joy – joy that is complete.  Joy is much more
than happiness or giddiness.  Joy is the sense of knowing we are doing what GOD
wants us to be doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was discussing with someone the mystery of salvation.  We
both agreed what is so magnificent about salvation is that salvation is all
gift – gift from GOD.  We cannot earn salvation.  The joy comes from knowing
how much GOD has gifted us.  Keeping the commandments is not what brings us
salvation.  Salvation, and our realization of salvation, leads to our wanting
to keep the commandments.  Our “GOoD” actions show that we have accepted the
gift of faith/salvation that GOD has given us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the book, A Hole in Our Gospel, the author (Richard
Stearns) remarks that there are three commandments:   1) Love GOD with our
whole mind, heart, soul, and body; 2) Love our neighbor as ourselves;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3) Go out to the whole world and proclaim the Gospel, the
GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the “GOoD” actions – the commandments – that we
should want to do is to spread the GOoD News that we have received.  We are
called to share that with others.  That’s what today’s reading from the Acts of
the Apostles relates.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always chuckle at St. Peter’s words in today’s First
Reading.  In speaking about the Jewish rules and regulations, he says:  “Why,
then, are you (some of the Christian leaders) now putting GOD to the test by
placing on the shoulders of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor
we have been able to bear?” Peter realizes that the stipulations of the Jewish
laws are impossible to fully keep.  Besides, strictly keeping all the precepts
of the law does not bring us salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has brought us salvation.  Peter reminds us:  “We
believe we are saved through the grace (gift) of the Lord Jesus, in the same
way as they (the non-Jews).” Salvation is a gift.  It is not the reward for
keeping the laws nor belonging to the “correct” religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does that mean that all laws are meaningless? No, not at
all.  They are to be guides for us.  Once when I was meeting with my
sixth-grade advisory group at school, the question came up about whether we can
disobey a law that is wrong.  One student remarked:  “I would if I knew I
wouldn’t be caught.”  After others shared their </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>feelings, I shared my view.  There is a stipulation in
Church teaching that “an unjust law is no law at all.”  We, as followers of
Jesus, are called to a higher plane than rules and regulations.  St. Paul
describes it as the “Law of Love.”  This law demands that we, with formed
conscience, can go, and are called to go, against mere mortal laws for a higher
reason.  We should be willing to go against unjust and bad laws, not just if we
won’t be caught, but also even if we will be caught.  In fact, we should be
willing to face the consequences of disobeying a “bad” law, if we are motivated
by a higher law of loving GOD and those whom GOD loves, and thus bringing the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD News to others.  If we are willing to live out this new
commandment of Jesus (“love one another as I have loved you”), then we will
know the joy of Jesus and that joy will be complete, even in the midst of any
flack or persecution we may face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I received an email from someone who receives my
reflections.  This person wanted to share a joyful experience with me.  The joy
came from being able to minister to a customer who came into the retail store
in which the “friend” worked.  After being able to witness about the Lord
Jesus, the “friend” felt a deep sense of joy and wanted to share the joy with
me by emailing me.  A real sense of joy and the presence of the Holy Spirit was
evident not only from the experience itself, but also in the very sharing of
the experience with me.  By</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>proclaiming GOD’s marvelous (or in the words of this person,
“awesome”) deeds, at least three persons were edified and were made joyful. 
And I pray that you who are reading this reflection may be edified and have a
sense of joy also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is important is accepting the gifts that come from
Jesus.  The gift of salvation, the gift of witnessing, the gift of joy, the
gift of being “at-one” with Jesus, His Abba, and the Holy Spirit.  The gift is
being able to sit at table with the Lord Jesus, and also being able to share in
GOD’s joy.  Once we have accepted those gifts, we will want to live a life that
proclaims the GOoD News we have accepted.  We will live the life of Jesus
(“love one another as I have loved you”), even if, or especially if, that means
acting in a way that goes against rules and regulations that do not reflect
Gospel values.  Living as a follower of Jesus means standing up against ways
that promote non-GODly points of view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also conscious of all the people, like my friend who
died a few years ago, who live out the GOoD News</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Jesus, while not feeling enslaved to the rules and
regulations of societies, including religious organization. This friend was
always conscious about loving everyone because he sensed the love he had
received from others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– his family and ultimately from GOD.  He would go out of
his way to serve and minister to anyone who needed his help.  Even as he was
dying with his family surrounding him, he had a sense of joy and hope as he not
only looked back on his life, but also looked forward to being with loved ones
who had passed on before him.  He was able to proclaim the marvelous deeds of
GOD even in his dying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  To what laws or
prescriptions am I enslaved that prevent me from fully accepting the gift of
salvation and the joy from the Lord Jesus? How do I manifest the joy of the
Lord Jesus in my daily life? To whom can I proclaim the marvelous deeds of the
Lord Jesus by the way I treat him/her/them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have given us gifts throughout our lives (both our individual
lives and our lives as members of the human family).  You want us to experience
the joy that comes from following Your Son, Jesus.  He has given us an example
of what it means to do Your will – to love others through caring service.  We
thank You for the gift of salvation that flows from Jesus and His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>death and resurrection.  May we accept the gift You give us
and reflect that joy as we proclaim the GOoD News to others.  We ask this
through Jesus Christ, Your Son, Who wants us to have His joy, a joy that is
complete, for He is our Master and Lord Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>May 8, 2026  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of Fifth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Gregory VII:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 15: 22-31;        Psalm 57: 8-9, 10 and
12;         John 15: 12-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings give us insights into the early Christian
community.  In the Acts of the Apostles, the leaders of the early Church
produce the first pastoral message from the first ecumenical council. 
“Ecumenical” literally means “inhabited world” or “whole household.”  The
ecumenical proclamation from the Council in Jerusalem is that Gentiles do not
have to become Jews in order to become Christians.  A convert to Christianity
needs only to keep the basic commandments of avoiding idolatrous practices and
remaining faithful to marriage vows.  Being a Christian is much different than
being a slave to rituals and rules.  It is having the experience that one is
truly now a friend of GOD and part of the Family of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Trinity – an adopted son or daughter of GOD,
brother/sister of the Lord Jesus, and inspired by the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial reminds us that GOD is to be praised in the
midst of all people.  A close relationship with GOD is not limited to the
Jewish nation, but, through the spreading of the GOoD News, is to be made
available to all people who come to believe in GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His Last Supper discourse. 
He calls His disciples into a new and closer relationship.  It is no longer a
Master-Teacher/slave-apprentice relationship.  Jesus is calling His followers
into a friendship relationship based on a freely given response of love.  On
the night before He dies, Jesus proclaims that a true friend is one who is
willing to give up one’s life for another.  The hallmark of this new
friend-relationship is that type of unconditional love – agape – that Jesus
will demonstrate on the next day by His death on the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the things that strikes me about the First Reading is
the words of the Jerusalem Council as they proclaim the first edict.  After a
great deal of lively discussion, they say, “It is the decision of the Holy
Spirit and ours, too.”  Even though they have spent a great amount of time
hotly debating what to do with Gentiles who want to follow Jesus, they realize
that through their prayer, they are being guided by the Holy Spirit to issue a
proclamation that will affect not only their time, but the future.  This
process of look</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>looking at the different sides of the issue and praying for
a consensus is called the discernment of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’m sure that part of their decision and discernment flowed
from Jesus’ commands on the night before He died.  The early Church leaders
realized that their setting policy was to be modeled not on the concept that
they were the know-it-alls of the faith and had authority to force others to do
what they wanted.  They were called rather to love one another, not burdening
others with laws that they themselves could not keep, but being willing to lay
down their lives for the sake – the salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) – of
others.  Agape (unconditional love) is what Jesus called them to use in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>making all decisions.  If they openly discussed, prayed, and
asked for the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they would be led to do the most
loving thing for those with whom they were called to be friends and whom they
were called to serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A while ago I read a book on the Ignatian practice of the
“Examen.”  In this daily prayer form, there are five steps: 1) Adoration
(Praise) of GOD, 2) Petition (presenting my needs to GOD), 3) Review of my
actions of the last 24 hours, 4) seeking Forgiveness of my failings, 5)
Commitment to doing the will of GOD more fully in the next 24 hours. St.
Ignatius of Loyola spoke of this process as Discernment of Spirit – being
guided to review, reflect, and make a decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings challenge me to examine what is the driving
force in my relationship with other believers and with those to whom I called
to proclaim the GOoD News.  Am I seeking to have a loving friendship based on
service – my service of others?  Do I seek the GOoD counsel of other believers
and pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit?  After thoughtful and prayerful
reviewing of the issues in my lives, am I able to say, “It is the decision of
the Holy Spirit, and mine, too”? If I can answer “yes” to these questions, then
I will know, to the best of my abilities, that I am seeking to do GOD’s will
and I will be able to say with the psalmist today, “I will give thanks [to You]
among all the peoples, O LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a parallel, I have communicated (online) with many people
who were sequestered during the pandemic. Many have said that they were finding
more time to pray and were focusing more on how they can serve others. They
felt the Holy Spirit was empowering them during the crisis to focus more on
what GOD wanted them to ponder.  They were seeking the blessings which GOD was
willing to impart from doing the right thing during the global issue of the
pandemic and crisis in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and climate changes and
the effects of these crises throughout the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I experience
the guidance of the Holy Spirit in my life?  How do I “confirm” that
experience?  With whom do I confer so that I know that I am not just fooling
myself?  What is the guiding principle behind my decision?  Is it the
unconditional love I have for others, my willingness to lay down my life for
another or is it some selfish pursuits?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You call us into a closer relationship with You.  You have sent Your
Son, Jesus, as the One Who invites us into this relationship.  He is calling
us, as He called His disciples of old, not to be slaves to rules and
regulations, but to love and serve others as He has loved and served His
disciples and all those with whom He came in contact during His early life and
continues from His heavenly place beside You, in union with the Holy Spirit. 
When we are called upon to make decision affecting other people’s lives, He
asks us to seek the discernment of the Holy Spirit, so that we can do what is
best for others, even to the point of laying down our lives, as He laid down
His life in His service, suffering, and death.  We thank You and praise You for
the gifts that come from a relationship with You, Your Son, and the Holy
Spirit.  May we be willing to lovingly share those gifts with others.  We make
this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Friend, Brother,
Master-Teacher, Lord and Savior, Who has died, is risen, and continues to live
and reign with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saturday of Fifth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 16: 1-10;       Psalm 100: 1b-2, 3, 5;      
John 15: 18-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul continues his missionary
journey.  For the first time we hear about Timothy, whose mother was a
Jewish-Christian and whose father was a Greek (presumably non-believing
Gentile).  Paul is led to travel to Macedonia (Greece, and therefore
present-day Europe) to spread the faith there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, on the night before He died, Jesus
tells His disciples that they will continue His work and can expect to be
treated just as Jesus is being treated – that is, being rejected and even
persecuted by some, but also revered and respect by others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I think about the call to
discipleship.  Jesus invites people to continue His ministry and mission by
proclaiming the GOoD News.  It can sound exciting (which it is), but also a bit
scary, especially as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we hear such things as Jesus mentions in the Gospel today: 
“No servant is greater than his Master.  If they persecuted Me, they will
persecute you.” Also, we may be a bit apprehensive as we hear how Christians in
the Middle East and throughout the world are being persecuted and martyred. 
Yes, we are called to do as the Master did, even to the point of being
persecuted as He was.  That’s the role of a disciple – to follow the Master and
carry on the Master’s work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus obviously was guided by the Holy Spirit, since He was
and is one with His Abba-Father and the Holy Spirit.  He was Spirit-filled. 
The Spirit strengthened Jesus to do all that He was called to do.  Yet it was
not always easy for Jesus.  He realized that part of the divine plan was His
having to suffer and die, because He was announcing a message that did not
coincide with the message of the world.  Jesus reminds us today:  “If the world
hates you, realize that it hated Me first.  If you belonged to the world, the
world would love its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I
have chosen you out of the world, the world hates you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul also was very much aware of the Spirit’s guidance. 
Although it may have seemed he should go a certain way, he remarks in today’s
reading that he was prevented from doing so “by the Holy Spirit.”  A few verses
later it says that he could not go another direction because “the Spirit of
Jesus did not allow.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a conflict between being of the world and being
guided by the Spirit.  The world would have us be, or go, one way, whereas the
Spirit is most often leading us to be something different and to go another
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to go the way of the world.  We are constantly
being bombarded by the world’s messages:  “Buy this and you will be happy.” 
“Look younger, thinner, healthier by using this product.”  “Pamper yourself.” 
We succumb to the world.  And the world (especially those who will gain
something from out being part of the world) loves us for being of the world,
and they love even more what they gain from us being of the world.  And if we
dare step out in a different direction, we receive flack.  We are considered
fanatics if we live by Gospel values such as honesty, generosity, kindness, or
servanthood.  Being like the Master will lead to being treated like the Master
– ridiculed, persecuted, despised, and even possibly being killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we are disciples of the Master, we will follow the
Spirit’s lead.  And we are enabled to follow the Spirit’s lead only when we
continue to come again and again and sit at the Master’s feet, listen to His
Word, and put it into practice.  That takes prayer and study.  It demands discipline. 
It requires commitment on our part.  It is not easy.  And we will be tempted
along our faith journey to take the easy way out.  Yet, little by little we can
make a difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An interesting thing happened to me a few years ago.  One of
my co-teachers was having computer problems</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(or so he thought).  He did not think that his email program
was working.  I went to his room and tested it out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was working fine.  He remarked, “I didn’t think it was
working because usually I have all sorts of emails, and when I clicked on the
button to check if I had any new email, nothing happened.  I didn’t think it
was possible</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that it would happen that no one would send me email.” 
Later that day, I made a point of sending him a positive, reassuring email
telling him that I was thinking about him and appreciated him as a friend.  He
wrote me back and thanked me and said, “How pastoral of you to do that.”  I
took that as a compliment of my being a disciple of the Master, the Pastoral
(“Shepherding”) One.  It was a simple thing, but it made a difference.  It let
someone know that they were appreciated and cared for, because the Master, the
GOoD Shepherd, the Pastor, loved and cared. By being open to the leading of the
Holy Spirit, GOD was able to touch the life of another person through my simple
act of sending an email.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the pandemic, I had heard of many people who had gone
out of their way to bring hope and a smile to another, even if it was only
through social media.  Entertainers had given concerts while staying at home. 
Our first responders and essential workers had put themselves in harm’s way
while serving others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another example of someone who reaches out with loving care
is a high school and college classmate of mine who sends me a note on the
anniversary of the deaths of my parents and other key events in my life of
which he keeps track.  He tells me that he is thinking about me and my loved
ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to look at our lives and see if the Spirit is
prompting us to reach out to others.  It does not have to be as dramatic as
Paul’s preaching to the Greeks.  Little opportunities will pop up for us to
share a little GOoD News with another.  There are all sorts of ways we can make
another person feel valued and appreciated.  When we do, we are following the
Master, we are being guided by the Holy Spirit.  The world may say, “Don’t be
ridiculous.  That other person just wasted your time calling you to do
something that isn’t important or that they should be able to fix on their
own.  You shouldn’t waste any more of your time making them feel appreciated or
valuable.”  Yet the Spirit prompts us and says, “Take the time to be present
for the other person.  Reach out to them in love.  Help them know that they are
valuable in your eyes (and therefore in GOD’s eyes).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me give one more personal example.  On my last birthday
I received almost 100 Facebook greetings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most only said, “Happy Birthday, Bob.”  I wrote back to each
one who sent me a message.  I wrote two or three sentences, thanking them and
personalizing each response by recalling something I remembered especially
about the person to whom I was writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Master-Teacher prompts us to keep our eyes and ears –
and heart – open to the Spirit’s prompting.  We can make a difference in small
ways.  Some people (who are operating on worldly value system) will laugh at us
and put us down for our Christian (Christ-like) attitude.  Yet that’s what we
are called to do – be Christ-like.  If we are aware of the presence of the
Spirit, we will also be prevented from going to places where GOD does not want
us to go.  All it takes is work, discipline, and a willingness to learn from
the Master.  (And maybe that last point should be first.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is the guiding
force in my life? Is it the ways of the world or the Spirit of Jesus? How can I
be more attentive to the Spirit’s prompting rather than the world’s push and
pull? What can I do to help another person be more in touch with the Spirit of
Jesus and/or to sense they are loved by GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever present and always seeking
to guide us. Through Your GOoDness, You have first sent us Your Son as our
Master-Teacher Who gives us an example of how to care for others with the love
You have for them. As He preached the GOoD News of Your concern, He met
opposition and ridicule. Yet, through the enabling power of the Holy Spirit,
Jesus kept going, even to the point of being hated and persecuted. Jesus calls
His disciples to continue His ministry. Jesus has empowered His modern-day
disciples (us) through the power of the same Holy Spirit. May we continue to
respond to the movement of the Holy Spirit in our lives. We ask that, through
the Holy Spirit, we may receive the strength, wisdom, and discernment to learn
from the Master and continue His work. We ask this in Jesus’ name, for He is
our Lord and Master, He is Your Son and our Brother, Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>May 25, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sixth Sunday of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Bede the Venerable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 15: 1-2, 22-29;     Psalm 67: 2-3, 5, 6,
8;     Revelation 21: 10-14, 22-23;     John 14: 23-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we are given a glimpse of the process that GOD puts
into place to bring about Light – the divine plan of salvation.  Our First
Reading describes what leads to, and flows from, the Council of Jerusalem that
deals with the issue of Gentiles becoming members of the Church.  Even in the
Hebrew Scriptures, as we see in the Responsorial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm today, there is acknowledgment that all peoples and
all nations will praise GOD. The excerpt from the Book of Revelation presents a
view of the heavenly celebration of GOD’s beloved – the final and everlasting
living out of GOD’s salvific will.  In the Gospel, as Jesus gives His last will
and testimony to His disciples at the Last Supper, He shares what His
inheritance gifts to them will be:  a sharing in the love that unites Himself
to His Abba-Father, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the sense of true
Shalom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading is taken from the fifteenth chapter of
Acts.  It begins with the Antioch</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christians sending representatives (Paul, Barnabas, and
others) to the center of Christians in Jerusalem with the desire of having some
light shone on the issue of what is required of Gentiles who become members of
the Christian Community/Church.  The actual discussion in Jerusalem is left out
of our pericope today that concludes with the sending of envoys to Antioch with
the result of the Council of Jerusalem.  Yet in the letter that is to be
proclaimed in Antioch, we hear how the Holy Spirit has enlightened the leaders
in Jerusalem concerning what is to be asked of those who wish to come into the
Light of GOD.  Those who become members of Christian faith community do not
need to be burdened by all the 613 prescriptions of the Jewish law.  The only
requirements deal with not partaking in pagan rituals, and dietary and marital
issues.  This decree opens the door more fully to the Gentiles who wish to
embrace belief in Jesus and share in the salvation that He brings to all
peoples – the Light that flows from GOD. GOD has revealed the total plan of
salvation – the gift of relationship with the Divine offered to all peoples – even
in the Hebrew scriptures.  The psalm today is one example of that.  Repeatedly
the Responsorial speaks of all peoples and nations giving honor and praise to
GOD.  GOD desires to be in relationship with all individuals.  And the prayer
of praise includes a petition that GOD let the Divine face “shine” on all the
people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The selection from the Book of Revelation describes the New
Jerusalem – the heavenly one – and it shows how GOD’s plan of salvation flowed
from the foundations of both the Jewish beginnings (the twelve tribes of the
Israelites) and the foundation of the twelve apostles, and out to all peoples. 
This new place of GOD’s presence does not need a temple, for GOD’s presence can
be experienced throughout. There is no need for lamps or lights, for GOD is the
source of Light (GOoDness, joy, warmth, peace).  GOD the Abba-Father, united
with the Lamb (Jesus), enlightens all who come into this heavenly city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel passage is part of Jesus’ last words to His
disciples on the night before</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He dies.  He is giving them (and through them, us) what
they/we will need in order to carry on His mission and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ministry.  The words today reveal the unity of purpose
within the Triune GODhead.  Jesus is intimately united</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with His Abba.  And just as He has come to do the will of
His Abba in love, so He is sending out (“apostling”) His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples to do the will of His Abba by their loving one
another.  Jesus realizes that they will need help in doing this.  He knows that
He has been empowered by His union with His Abba through the Holy Spirit Who is
the completion of the GODhead.  So Jesus promises to send the Holy Spirit upon
His disciples to enlighten them and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bring them the Shalom (Peace) that they will need to carry
on His work.  In John’s Gospel, Jesus fulfills this promise on Easter
(Resurrection) Sunday when He greets the apostles with the message of “Shalom”
and breathes the Holy Spirit into them.  It is only when the disciples
participate in the life of the Triune GOD that they are able to proclaim the
message of salvation to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am energized.  I realize
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been given a share in the divine plan of salvation. 
Not only have I been offered a glimpse of what GOD’s plan is, I am being asked
to help bring the message of salvation to others.  I know that I cannot fully
comprehend the “big picture” GOD has for the world, but GOD has shed Light on
part of it and is asking me to reflect that Light to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The image that comes to me is that of a bright light
shining.  I realize that this light is shining on me.  There are a few options
I have in responding to this light.  One is that I can turn away from the light
and try to ignore it. Another is I can remain a black object that tries to
absorb all the light myself.  The third possibility is that I can be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a reflector and allow the light to bounce off me and shine
somewhere else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A reflector does absorb some light even in the process of
allowing the light to be cast elsewhere.  The real power of a reflector is
being able to focus its beam in conjunction with other reflectors to wherever
the designer of reflectors wants the light to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To think about this concept of reflecting light, I recall
hearing how much work goes into creating the reflecting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>surfaces of telescopes and also beams of light, such as in a
lighthouse.  They must be ground, polished, and bent so that the light they
take in is almost completely beamed to a specific point.  The reflecting
surface has to be formed so as to be most perfectly in line with the plan of
the designer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My role is to reflect the Light where the Designer wants the
Light to be focused.  I may have to be rubbed hard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and reworked so that I can reflect more light.  I may have to
bend in a way that is not comfortable for me, so that I can allow the Light to
shine where GOD wants it to shine.  It is only when I am united fully with the
source of Light and with other reflecting surfaces that GOD’s plan of
enlightening the world can be accomplished to the perfection that GOD desires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on my being used by GOD to help enlighten the
world, I am reminded of the words of today’s psalm:  “May GOD let the Divine
face shine upon us.  So may Your way be known upon earth; among all nations,
Your salvation.”  The Light that shines on us is the face of GOD, the Triune
presence of GOD Who wishes all to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be united in the love, life, and peace that flows between
the Abba, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  That is the plan of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s salvation.  And that is what we are privileged to
experience and reflect to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today is: What areas of my
life need to be rubbed and polished so that the Light of GOD can reflect more
perfectly from me? On whom am I being called to let GOD’s Light be focused
today?  What can I do for that/those individual(s) so she/he/they can be more
aware of the Light of GOD’s face shining on her/him/them? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Eternal Light.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have desired to shine the Light of Your Face upon us, especially
in the sending of Your Son and Your Holy Spirit.  Yet we have often chosen to
remain in the darkness of our sins rather than allow Your Light to shine on
us.  And even when we have been willing to come into Your light, we have
sometimes tried to only absorb Your light selfishly rather than reflect it to
others.  Through the continued outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, help us to
follow the example of Your Son, Jesus, Who reflected Your Light upon all those
who came to Him.  Help us to accept the rubs that come into our lives to make
us better reflectors of Your Light.  And may we join with all those who will
eternally give Your praise,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thanks, and glory, for You, together with Your Son and the
Your Holy Spirit, are our Light, our Love, our Shalom,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– our one and only GOD – for ever and ever.  Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>May 26, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Philip Neri (readings from Mon. of 6th Week
of Easter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Marian and James -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Acts 16: 11-15;        Psalm 149: 1b-2, 3-4, 5-6a
and 9b;         John 15: 26 – 16: 4a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings portray two contrasting images (both true) of
what the early Church experienced.  The reading from Acts gives us a glimpse of
the positive spread of the Church in Macedonia.  St. Paul arrives in Neapolis
(meaning “new city” that was near Thessalonika/modern Thessaloniki) and travels
on to Philippi.  The Gospel warns the disciples that they will face persecution
as they are called to give witness μαρτυρετε  – martyreite) and testify
concerning Jesus and His mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, the preaching of St. Paul takes effect
in what is part of modern Europe.  After arriving in Neapolis (near modern Kavala,
Greece), Paul travels on to Philippi, where he converts the first “European
Christian.” This is Lydia, who becomes a supporter of the missionary efforts of
Paul and his traveling companions. The community of faith continues to expand
as the Gospel (GOoD News) is preached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise sung by GOD’s people as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they experience GOD’s blessings in their lives.  Praise is
the appropriate response to GOD’s working in people’s lives. Praising in the
midst of the assembled crowd is even more powerful, for that gives witness to
GOD’s might deeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, as He continues His Last Supper Discourse in today’s
Gospel, gives both a promise and a warning. He promises to send the Holy Spirit
as the Paraclete (or Advocate or Helper).  The role of the Paraclete is to
legally and emotionally defend and protect, support and give testimony
(witness) on behalf of Jesus, and later for His disciples. Jesus also warns His
disciples that they will have to give testimony (witness - martyreite).  Part
of this giving witness will include being a martyr with their lives.  Their
lives will give witness, not just in what they say, or how they act, but also
in the persecution and even death</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they may experience because of their willingness to proclaim
their relationship to Jesus and their commitment to His mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some ways, things are much different today than in the
early years of Christianity.  We may not see the rapid growth of faith that St.
Paul and his companions experienced.  As Americans, we also may not experience
the same type of persecution that Jesus warns His disciples they would have. 
We live in a country (the United States) where religion is seen as part of
life, part of our freedom as Americans.  We may be aware that there are many
Christians who are being martyrs by dying for their belief in Jesus, as groups,
like ISIS, move into certain areas of the Middle East.  There were also reports
that the Russian soldiers targeted some Christians during the Ukrainian War. 
In America, some Christian and Christian churches are facing challenging times,
as we live in a culture that goes against the values proclaimed by the Gospel. 
There have been contentions (both legal and personal) between Christians
upholding the Right to Life vs. others who push for the right for a woman to
choose an abortion (Pro Choice).  A couple of years ago, a California bill
passed the Assembly (CA AB 2943).  Some believe that if the bill were to become
law, it could result in legal issues for preachers who discuss sexuality. 
Passage would lead to more harassment and possible legal challenges against
preaching, literature, conferences and organizations that address sexual
morality, and even make it possible to prevent the sale of Bibles.  Another
bill would force priests to share what they hear in the Sacrament of
Reconciliation, that is totally against the Catholic Church’s rule about the
seal of confession, that forbids priest from revealing what was confessed to
them in Reconciliation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are being called to be witnesses of the faith.  The way
we give witness may not be in the exact same way as Paul or the other early
disciples did.  We have to give witness by standing up for our beliefs and
manifesting our way of life in a world that tolerates us and yet portrays
values contradictory to a true Christian way of life.  That is a challenge for
us.  It </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>implies that we have to set ourselves distinctively apart
from the ways of the commercialized, self-centered world, and we must do it in
a manner that invites others to accept the GOoD News.  Our lives must be a
joyful witness in a way that entices people to want to have a relationship with
the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although our approach to witnessing (being martyrs to) the
faith may be different than that of the first believers in Jesus or even those in
the Middle East and other parts of the world today, one aspect that is not
different is Who is our Supporter and Helper (the Advocate or Paraclete).  The
same Holy Spirit is willing and ready to guide us in our giving witness as much
as the Spirit did for Paul, Peter, and the rest of the first GOoD News
proclaimers.  We just need to frequently (daily, hourly) call upon the Holy
Spirit to be with us, to strengthen us, to guide us in our witnessing to the
faith.  The Holy Spirit will show us how we can live in a way that truly
proclaims the GOoD News of Jesus to the modern world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this time of a world health crisis, climate concerns,
world tensions between nations, the Holy Spirit can show us ways we can reach
out to others and help them as they deal with the repercussion from these
worldly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>issues.  We might be led to send messages and encouraging
true news items.  We can tell others that we are praying for them and their
loved ones.  We can support first responders, medical personnel, and essential
workers, politicians working for true Christian values, scientists seeking ways
to deal with the climate, and worldly political concerns.  We can ask the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit to empower us to care in a positive way for others
and we can focus on GOoD news instead of all the negative news of the last few
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Spirit may move us to be more understanding and loving
to members of our family, especially with those with whom we may be having
problems communicating. The Advocate may give us the fortitude to deal honestly
and lovingly with the people with whom we come in contact in our work
environment. The Paraclete will give us the wherewithal to treat others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in a way that shows we are in relationship with a GOD Who is
Love.  The Spirit of the Risen Lord will be with us, so that our lives give
witness to the GOoD News in face of the bad news that is being proclaimed by
the world around us.  We may be guided by the Spirit to reach out to the less
fortunate both whom we encounter directly and those living across the globe. We
can make a difference in people’s lives in ways similar to the ways the early
Christians did in their time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being witnesses (martyroi) requires that we become as
committed to Jesus and His mission and to the guidance of the Holy Spirit as
the first witnesses of the faith were committed to Gospel and the modern
martyrs in some of Middle Eastern countries and into what is modern Europe. 
That takes time in prayer and reflection on the Word of GOD.  It means we have
to see how we can “proclaim the GOoD News at all times, and if necessary, using
words” (paraphrase of St. Francis of Assisi’s words).  Yet, if we are willing
to make the decision to be His disciples and follow Jesus completely in our
lives, then we will have the gift of the Holy Spirit.  We will then be able to
echo the words of today’s psalm and say, “Let the high praises of GOD be in
[our] throats.  This is the glory of all GOD’s faithful ones.  Alleluia.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  To whom am I being
called to witness my faith in the Lord Jesus? In what particular area in my
life do I need the help of the Paraclete (Holy Spirit) so that I can be a
better witness? Is there some area in my life that needs to be brought more in
line with Gospel values? How can I reassure others of the Holy Spirit acting in
their lives as the Helper, Advocate, and Intercessor?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever present with us.  Through
Your GOoDness, You call us to give witness to the GOoD News Your Son has
brought into the world and shared with us – that You love us and want to have a
relationship with us. We have sometimes failed to be witnesses to (martyrs for)
this message because we have feared the reaction of others, or we have not been
totally committed to spreading the Gospel – GOoD News.  For this, we ask Your
pardon and forgiveness.  We ask that You continue to pour into our lives Your
Holy Spirit, the Advocate and Paraclete, Who gifts us with strength, wisdom,
and power, so that we can proclaim our relationship with You, in and through
Your Son, Jesus. Through the continued presence of the Holy Spirit in our
lives, help us to spend the time we need listening to, and putting into action,
the teachings of Jesus.  Make our lives – the way we treat others – true
testimonies to the Gospel.  And may we always give You the glory and praise for
what You have done, are doing, and will continue to do until we are one with  you,
Your Son, and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>Tuesday of the Sixth Week of Easter (Opt. Mem. of St.
Augustine of Canterbury)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Augustine of Canterbury</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 16: 22-34;          Psalm 138: 1-2ab,
2cde-3, 7c-8;         John 16: 5-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD acts in mysterious ways.  In the First Reading, GOD sets
St. Paul and his companions free from their incarceration by means of an
earthquake.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about His going back to His
Abba-Father so that He can send the Advocate (Paraclete), the Holy Spirit.  The
early followers of Jesus must have been constantly amazed at the workings of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After St. Paul and his traveling mates are arrested and
beaten, they are chained up inside the most protected jail cells (maximum
security) in Philippi (in modern Greece).  Even in their confinement, they sing
praise to GOD.  GOD allows an earthquake to shake the jail, opening the jail
gates, and loosening the chains and stakes holding the prisoners.  GOD also
uses the whole experience to bring salus (healing, safety, salvation) not only
to Paul and his ministerial companions, but also to the jailer and the family
of the jailer.  [In the summer of 2018, I was able to go to Philippi and see
one of the possible sites of the imprisonment of St. Paul.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for the way GOD
responds to the cries of those who trust in GOD.  It is the right hand of GOD
that brings salus to those who call upon GOD’s name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as Jesus continues His Last Supper Discourse,
He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prepares His disciples for His going away.  He informs them
that it is necessary for Him to leave, so that He can send the Holy Spirit. 
The disciples must be quite confused by all the things that have been happening
during these last few days and what will happen over the next few days:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has been welcomed into the city of Jerusalem as the
Messianic hero; He has washed their feet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and given them an example of how the leader is to be the
servant.  His words to them about having to die are quite upsetting, but not as
upsetting as what will happen during the next day when He will be arrested,
tried, mistreated, crucified, and will ultimately die on the cross.  Yet in all
of this, Jesus promises to send them the Paraclete (the Advocate – the Holy
Spirit) Who will strengthen them, give them knowledge and understanding, and
guide them in what they will do to continue the mission and ministry of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we read today’s readings, we see that living as a
follower of Jesus during the early years of the fledgling Church is truly
amazing.  GOD works marvelous deeds to reveal the divine love to those whom GOD
is calling to further the Gospel message.  I often wonder how I would have
responded to all the happenings if I had lived at those times.  I might have
acted like St. Peter, who at times promised Jesus that he is the most faithful
disciple, and then denies His Lord three times at the most crucial time  in
Jesus’ human life.  I might have been like St. Paul, working against the spread
of the GOD’s Reign, only to later change my direction and start to work for
furthering of Gospel message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was once asked, “why don’t we see events as ostentatious
as what happened in the first century of Christianity?”  Maybe it is because we
are not looking with the eyes of faith.  Maybe it is because we have not asked
for the further outpouring of the Holy Spirit which/Who has been promised not
only to the early believers but also to us.  GOD is still willing to work
marvelous deeds.  All we need do is open our eyes and expect to see the great
deeds that GOD is doing.  The medical profession heals people in ways that were
undreamed of just a couple generations ago.  They “created” a vaccine to the
Covid19 virus in record time.  Mass communication has made it possible for us to
know and respond to world crisis (such as the pandemic and poverty and the War
in Ukraine and civil war in Sudan) and natural disasters in record time and
visually see each other via social media. These are miraculous signs of GOD’s
hand at work.  GOD is working through people during these troubling times of
the world in which we live, but we have to look and see the Holy Spirit’s
prompting in the actions of those who trying to help and serve others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I look back on my life, I can see GOD’s presence in the
events that have happened.  GOD has sent the Holy Spirit to me at key moments
in my life, to inspire me and direct me.  It is true, that like St. Peter, I
have fallen into sin and failed to live up to the promises I had boldly made. 
Yet, GOD has seen me through and allowed GOoD to happen in spite of my sinful
ways.  GOD has placed me at certain times and places in my life that I might
share the GOoD News with others who may not have heard the Gospel message
unless I had been there to share it.  Again, it is not my doing, it is GOD’s
doing.  It is when I reflect on the presence of the Holy Spirit in my life that
I begin to see how GOD is still working marvelous deeds.  The Holy Spirit is
still active in the lives of believers today.  The Paraclete is still
strengthening those who are weak.  The Advocate is still enlightening the minds
of believers who need to profess their faith in the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge before me (and maybe before you also) is to
continue to pray for the further outpouring of the Holy Spirit in my life (and
your life).  We need to ask that our eyes of faith be open, our minds be made
receptive, our wills be directed to GOD’s action.  The more we are aware of
GOD’s Spirit with us, the greater GOD’s deeds will be manifested and the more
we will be able to praise GOD.  It is then that we will be able to pray with
the psalmist today:  “When I called, You answered me; You built up strength
within me.  Your right hand saves me.  The LORD will complete what the LORD has
done for me; your kindness, O LORD, endures forever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What blocks or
hindrances are present in my life that prevent a fuller outpouring of the Holy
Spirit?  How can I be more open to the marvelous deeds of GOD that are always
around me?  For what particular manifestation of GOD’s right hand during the
last week can I give thanks to GOD?  With whom will I share the GOoD News of
that event?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever revealing Yourself to us. 
Through Your GOoDness and the words of Your Son, You have promised that You
would send Your Holy Spirit upon us to strengthen, edify, give wisdom and
understanding to us.  We have not always taken that promise to heart.  We have
limited the influence of Your Holy Spirit by not fully responding to the gifts
that have been offered to us.  For our failures to respond to Your gift of the
Holy Spirit, we ask for Your forgiveness and pardon.  Continue to make us open
to the working of Your Holy Spirit in our lives.  Inflame the fire of Your love
within us.  Fill us with wisdom, understanding, right judgment, and GOoD
counsel so that we may serve those whom You have placed in our paths.  And may
we give You all the glory and praise for Your continued acting in our lives
with marvelous deeds.  As always, we make this prayer in the name of Jesus,
Your Son, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who has promised us the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit and Who is faithful to His promises.  It is He Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May 28, 2025 <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Venerable Pierre Toussaint</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 17: 15, 22 -- 18: 1;       Psalm 148: 1-2,
11-12,13, 14;        John 16: 12-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, we are reminded that the GOoD News of Jesus is
meant to be passed on, handed down (“traditionized”).  It is something in which
we have been invited to participate.  We continue in our understanding of the
GOD Who wants us to be joined with Jesus through the power and inspiration of
the Holy Spirit.  Then,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are asked to share with others what we have experienced. 
In the First Reading, St. Paul speaks to the people of Athens.  He speaks of
the “Unknown GOD” for Whom the Athenians have built a shrine.  Paul explains to
them that the Divinity Whom they do not “know” is the one and only GOD Who is
not far from them.  In the Gospel, Jesus once again reassures His disciples
(including us) that the Spirit of Truth will make “known” to them (and us) even
more about Who GOD is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul makes use of a shrine in Athens on the Areopagus
Hill, which is below the Acropolis (see photo to the right which I took in July
2018).  The shrine is dedicated to the “Unknown GOD.”  Paul tells the Athenians
that the GOD Whom they do not “know” is now being revealed to them.  This GOD
is the creator and giver of life.  He also mentions that even though they
continually search for this GOD, this GOD is actually as close to them as the
breath they breathe, for GOD gives them their breath (Pneuma = Ruah = Spirit). 
And they are children of this GOD.  This GOD has been fully made “known” by the
One Who has been raised from the dead – Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul meets some opposition.  Not many of the
“intellectuals” of Athens are willing to listen to him because he speaks of
things that they cannot fathom, such as people being raised from the dead.  A
few accept the GOoD News and become believers.  It does not deter St. Paul.  He
knows that he must continue to announce the message of salvation. Paul is not
distressed over the lack of response from the majority of the Athenians.  Thus,
he moves on to Corinth where he will find a more receptive audience.  He
realizes that sometimes those who claim to “know it all,” have no real
knowledge of what is most important in life – “knowledge” – a relationship with
a GOD Who is revealing the fullness of the GODhead to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as He continues His Last Supper Discourse on
the night before He dies, Jesus reassures His followers that they will come to
a fuller “knowledge” (i.e., understanding of GOD’s plan and a relationship with
GOD) when the Spirit of Truth comes upon them.  The Spirit will pick up where
Jesus leaves off and will add to their ability to understand and spread the
seeds of faith that Jesus has given to them.  That is because this Spirit, the
Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit of GOD, is one with Jesus and His Abba-Father.  The
Spirit is just a further revelation of the GOD Who is not fully known except
through a continued process of divine self-revelation to us and our feeble
minds and a growing in a personal relationship with Triune GOD and with other
believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that in some ways,
even though we have accepted the GOD Who is Abba-Father, Son, and  Holy Spirit,
we still have an unknown GOD.  We can never fully “know” GOD, at least
intellectually.  No matter how long we have been taught, studied, and had a
relationship with GOD, GOD continues to make “known” to us even more about Who
GOD is.  In my own life, having been raised in the faith, educated in a
Christian environment, and devoted myself to studying GOD’s Word, I am still in
awe as I come to fuller “knowledge” (both “understanding of” and a deeper
“relationship with” this GOD).  This struck me when I was at a confirmation
ceremony a few years ago and we ended the celebration with the singing of the
song, Our God Is an Awesome God.  The awesomeness of this GOD continually
overwhelms me.  I sometimes wrongly think that after all these years I would
not come to new insights about Who GOD is, but I do.  As I deepen my
relationship with GOD, I see GOD in a new light.  I experience in an even more
powerful and mystifying way who I am in the sight of GOD.  I am reminded of
another song that says, “Humble [yourself] in the sight of the Lord. . .and He
will lift you up.”  As I am drawn even more into this mystery of GOD, the only
response I can have is that of knowing how much I am loved and known by GOD,
and how much I still need to love and know this GOD.  The more I come to sit at
the feet of the Master and learn from the Teacher and be guided by the Spirit
of Truth, the more I am humbled, loved, and empowered.  I sense the need to
share this with others.  I know that I can never fully express the awesomeness
of this GOD Who is Love, but I want to try to help others come to a greater
“knowledge” (awareness of GOD’s presence and further developing of their
relationship with the GOD Who continues to want to be better “known” by us
mortals).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Our GOD is an awesome GOD.  He reigns from heaven above,
with wisdom, power, and love.  Our GOD is an awesome GOD.”  We cannot fully
understand this GOD Who has not been, nor Who cannot be, known intellectually
even to us who have been and are believers.  Yet, we can “know” (in the sense of
being in relationship with) GOD, but that, too, is an ongoing, never-ending
process.  This GOD is continuing to reveal the awesomeness that is GOD.  This
GOD only wants us (every one of the creatures GOD has made) to be in
relationship with the Divine Awesomeness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced the awesomeness of GOD? What caused me to sense this awesomeness? 
What did this experience do to help me better understand the GOD Who wants to
be “known” by me? How have I shared, or can I share, the awesomeness of GOD
with at least one other person today? This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, totally awesome.  Through Your
GOoDness, we can only begin, again and again, to understand You.  You want us
to grow in relationship with You Who are Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit. You have
continually revealed Yourself to us throughout the ages.  We, as individuals
and as a community, have heard Your Word proclaimed.  We are drawn into a
deeper relationship with You, especially as You have let us “know” You, in and
through the teaching, ministry, and life of Jesus.  Yet even that was not
enough.  You (Abba) and Your Son (Jesus) have sent us Your Holy Spirit to
expand our “knowledge” – understanding and relationship with You.  No matter
how long we have traveled along the path with the Son, we still do not fully
know You.  You have been the Unknown GOD Who wants to be “known.”  Even in
eternity, we will continue to be amazed as we grow in fuller “knowledge” –
relationship, and experience of Who You are.  You are truly awesome.  We praise
You and thank You for wanting us to come into Your presence and “know” You. 
May we always be open to Your further revelation of Yourself to us as Your
children, individually and as a whole.  We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lift up this prayer in the name of Jesus, Who is present
with us, in and through the Holy Spirit, and Who is living and reigning with
You, our GOD Whom we call Abba-Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Madeleine Sophie Barat:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 1: 1-11;      Psalm 47: 2-3, 6-7, 8-9;
Ephesians  1: 17-23   or Hebrews 9: 24-28; 10: 19-23;         </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>  Luke 24: 46-53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just a note:  In Acts 1: 1-11, it says that Jesus remained
with His disciples for forty days after His resurrection. On the fortieth day
Jesus ascended into heaven.  Some communities celebrate Jesus’ ascension today
(on the fortieth day after Easter).  Others celebrated His ascension this
coming Sunday (as many dioceses in the United States).  If you are in a
community which celebrates the Solemnity of Ascension on Sunday, you will use
the Thursday of the Sixth Week of Easter today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus remained with His disciples only a relatively short
period of time after His resurrection.  In the passage from the Acts of the
Apostles, St. Luke says it was forty days.  The other gospels accounts relate
that Jesus only was with His followers on some occasions during those forty
days, not consistently day after day.  Today, we have a couple accounts of
Jesus’ last words to His disciples before He returned to His Abba-Father in
heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question for us is, “what is the meaning of the
Ascension?”  Or more practically, “how am I going to live my life differently
because of the Lord’s Ascension?”  To be able to answer that, we need to look
more closely at the readings for today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles, St. Luke
remarks that after Jesus had spent forty days presenting His Risen Self to the
disciples.  He promised them that they would be “baptized with the Holy Spirit”
and be His witnesses starting in Jerusalem and spreading throughout the world. 
As Jesus ascends into heaven, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples stare into the skies, shocked and perplexed until
two white-clothed individuals ask them the questions, “Why are you standing
there looking into the sky?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from St. Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians speaks
about GOD giving a Spirit of wisdom and revelation to believers so that they
can have fuller knowledge of Jesus and they can realize the hope to which they
are called – a hope of an inheritance with Jesus, a share in His glory in
heaven, and a part in His Body, that is the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The alternate Second Reading from the Letter to the Hebrews
speaks of Jesus’ position now in the presence of His Abba in order to present
our needs to His Abba and to wait until the end of time when He will return to
take all “those who eagerly await Him” back into the heavenly presence where He
is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage today from the end of St. Luke’s Gospel,
Jesus speaks of empowering His disciples so that they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>could preach His name to all nations.  In some of the other
accounts of Jesus’ ascension, Jesus also promises that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He will be with His followers always, even until the end of
time (cf. Matthew 28: 16-20).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this says to me is that we are called and empowered to
continue the work of Jesus.  This is not just the call of the ordained clergy
or parish staff.  It is the call of each and every follower of Jesus.  Each of
us, as disciples of the Master, are given the ability, and responsibility, to
further the spread of the GOoD News.  As</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>members of the Body of Christ (the Church), we are gifted
with what we need to further the mission of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We often ask, “How can I serve in the proclamation of the
Gospel?” We think that because we have not been trained or because we have not
dedicated our lives to missionary work that we are not going to be responsible
for the ministry of spreading the faith.  In some ways we are like the
disciples who today look up in the heaven as Jesus is taken from their sight. 
We are awestruck by what we have experienced.  We often just spend time looking
up to the sky with our mouths wide open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we need beings dressed in white appearing to us
saying, “Why  are you standing there looking up into the sky?”  We need to be
challenged to quit standing around, doing nothing, and to get to work spreading
the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can take a little consolation in the fact that it took
the disciples at least ten days to get motivated.  And it was only after they
received the further outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost that they were
able to get moving in their mission of furthering the Gospel.  What we need to
do is to continue to pray for the coming of the Holy Spirit into our lives. 
The coming of the Holy Spirit, by the way, is not just a one-time thing.  It is
a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on-going process.  The more we are open to the Spirit’s
presence in our lives, the more we will be empowered to be Spirit-filled
individuals and become the missionaries whom we are called to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being missionaries does not mean we have to sell all our
belongings and move to some far away land to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spread the faith, although some may be called to do this. 
Missionaries literally means “those who have been sent” or those “on a
mission.”  Maybe we are being sent as “far away” as our own home.  We may be
called to announce the GOoD News to our family members.  The way we announce
the message is by living lives of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD News.  It may be the hardest audience to whom we can be
sent.  We may truly need the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to announce the GOoD
News, because our family knows who we really are, with all our failings and all
the times we have “missed the mark” (sinned) in living out the Gospel.  It can
be a real challenge to be evangelists (proclaimers of the GOoD News) to our
family, because it is so easy to forget our mission, due to the day-to-day
needs they and we face, both alone and together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is why we need to keep turning to the Lord and praying,
“Send us Your Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of us who are trying to be
faithful.  Inflame in our hearts the fire of Your love.”  What can help us is
the realization that we have been given, and are continuing to be given, the
Spirit of wisdom and revelation which enlightens us to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the hope of the call that Jesus has given us (see the Second
Reading).  If we strive to live out our missionary call, especially to those
whom we encounter each and every day, then Jesus promises us a share in His
inheritance, with the other holy ones, and the surpassing greatness of His
power.  We will share in His ascension at the end of our earthly life and even
more so at the end of time when we will be raised up to be with Him in glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: In what ways am I
like the apostles in my standing around looking up to heaven, wondering what is
happening without doing anything? To whom in my life is it most difficult to be
sent and to minister?  Which gift/fruit of the Holy Spirit (knowledge, wisdom,
understanding, peace, joy, discernment, hope, faith, love, endurance, being in
awe of GOD) do I need the most at this moment in my life? How can I more
faithfully proclaim the GOoD News to those to whom I am sent?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever desirous of our being with
You. Through Your GOoDness, You have called us to share in the mission of Your
Son, Jesus, Who has come to announce the GOoD News of Your love for each and
every person. We often stand in awe looking at the glory of Jesus. Yet, You
call us to not just stand looking up to heaven, but to begin the action of
spreading the GOoD News we have received. You promise to enable us and empower
us by the continual outpouring of Your Holy Spirit. We come into Your presence
today and pray, “Come, Holy Spirit! Come with Your gifts of knowledge and
wisdom, discernment and right judgement, with strength and humility.” We need
to be inspired (“in Spirited”) and made enthusiastic (“in GOD”) so we can
proclaim the values of the Gospel by our living Gospel lives. Give us the
ability to be faithful to the GOoD News, especially as we proclaim it to those
in our families, in our workplace, and wherever You lead us. As always, we make
this prayer in the name of Jesus our Master and Teacher, Who has called us to
be His disciples and Who has promised us the Holy Spirit, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of the Sixth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John of Avila:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Acts 18: 1-8;           Psalm 98: 1, 2-3ab,
3cd-4;       John 16: 16-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nota Bene:         It has been forty days since Easter. 
This is the fortieth day of Easter.  In Acts 1: 1-11, we read that Jesus
remained with His disciples for forty days after His resurrection. On the
fortieth day Jesus ascended into heaven.  Some communities celebrate Jesus’
ascension today.  Others transfer the celebration to the upcoming Sunday.  In
this reflection, I have chosen to reflect on Jesus’ ascension this coming
Sunday rather than today since this is what is done in Archdiocese of Los
Angeles and other American dioceses, especially in the Western US.  I will
provide a separate reflection for the Ascension being celebrated on Thursday,
May 29, 2025.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life is constantly changing. Today we hear about the changes
the St. Paul went through as he had to adjust his life to his ministry. Some
aspects remained the same, others changed quite dramatically for Paul. Jesus,
in today’s Gospel passage from His Last Supper discourse, also speaks about
change and how it will affect His followers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We pick up today’s First Reading from where we ended
yesterday. Paul leaves Athens and travels to Corinth. In Corinth he meets up
with some fellow Jews who have left Rome after</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the persecution of the Jews by Emperor Claudius. Paul makes
friends with these fellow Jews who also practice the trade of tent-making. Paul
feels at home with this married couple (Aquila and Priscilla) because they
share their common Jewish faith and also a common skill. Elsewhere we hear that
Aquila</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and Priscilla are Christians. Paul and his message, however,
are not equally received by other Jews in Corinth. In fact, some of the Jews
reject Paul’s announcement of the GOoD News. Paul realizes that from this time
forward his ministry is to focus on the Gentiles rather than his fellow Jews.
That is probably very hard for Paul. He wants the Jews to accept Jesus as much
as he wants the Gentiles to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, during His final discourse before this
death, Jesus speaks to His disciples about changes that will take place in
their lives because He is going to go away to His death (and later, His
Ascension). He promises that He will return in His resurrection (and
eventually, His Second Coming), but in the meantime, they will weep and mourn
while He is gone. He also promises that their sorrow and grief will turn to joy
as they realize that He is once again with them, and through the presence of
the Holy Spirit, He will always be with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflection turns to changes in our lives. Just as Paul,
Aquila, Priscilla, and the disciples of Jesus had to adjust to changes in their
lives, so we, too, must face, and adjust to, changes. This struck me a while
ago as I chatted with a former co-worker. This colleague was speaking about the
changes that needed to be made in the person’s life. My friend had become
accustomed to a certain way of living, working, and relating to people. The
individual had been happy being a teacher, but he wondered if there was more
being asked of him, particularly by GOD. The friend questioned what GOD was
asking of this person and whether it was okay to desire personal fulfillment
from GOD, besides having the occupational satisfaction of being a GOoD teacher
and a positive role model in the life of students. It seemed that there had
been a great deal of spiritual growth, educational growth, occupational growth,
but personal growth, particular in a long-term relationship was at a
standstill. The individual wanted to know what GOD was asking the person to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also remember talking to my cousin who sold his business,
his home, and moved to his wife’s homeland of Thailand. He realized he could
not continue living here because he could not afford the rent of his place of
business nor fight against big stores that were undercutting his prices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another cousin communicated with me concerning the fact that
our parents’ generation has now totally passed away and that we were now “the
older generation.” My cousin questioned what was being asked of us as
the“elders”or“senior citizens” of our family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, we have all faced rough times over the last few
years with the Corona Virus crisis, climate changes, conflicts throughout the
world, especially in Ukraine and Sudan, violence by individuals in our country,
inflation rates on fuel, food, housing, etc. Many of us who still had jobs were
working more than before either online or in our essential businesses. Others
were facing financial issues due to being unemployed. For all of us, our
lifestyle had changed in challenging ways during the global and local issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is always difficult to face new circumstances and events
that change our lives, whether that be the death of loved one, our own
sickness, changes in our community, moving to new places, a new job situation,
or realizing our position in society and in a family. A lot of my ministry as a
Stephen Minister, has been helping people to deal with the changes they are
forced to make in their lives. Change, even for the better, is not always easy.
We have to adjust to new ways of dealing with circumstances and even different
people. It can be very unsettling and even disturbing. We often ask, “why
couldn’t things just remain the same?” It is particularly frustrating when we
sense the changes are due to evilness or sudden, unexpected changes in the
world, such as terrorists, environmental conditions, political upheavals, the
pandemic, and/or circumstances beyond our control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need something, or more precisely, Someone, on Whom we
can depend to be the Constant in our lives. GOD wants to be that stable element
in our lives. The Lord Jesus wants us to depend on Him, after all, in the end
that is all to which (or to Whom) we will be able to cling. Jesus speaks to us
as He did to His disciples on the night before He died: “I tell you truly, you
will weep and mourn while the world rejoices; you will grieve for a time, but
your grief will be turned into joy.” Truly, this is a vale of tears through
which we walk. Yet, if we remain focused on our Lord Jesus, we will experience
a joy that will never end. The difficult part is remaining focused on the Lord
Jesus as we weep, and our eyes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fill with tears as everything seems to be changing. Yet,
Jesus has to be the center of our attention. With Him as our focal point, we
will be able to face all other challenges and changes that come our way. We
need to realize that, with Jesus, we have salus – wholeness, health,
well-being, salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have to be willing to let go of what we thought were our
security blankets. Everything can change. Friends can go by the way through
moving or death or change of attitude or worldwide conditions. The Lord Jesus,
however, will be there if we lift up our eyes and hearts. We must proclaim, as
our psalm today says, “Sing to the LORD a new song, for the LORD has done
wondrous deeds.” We may not presently see the events of our lives as wondrous
deeds of GOD, but the Lord Jesus will change the difficulties we face into
wondrous deeds. All we need do is to keep our eyes focused on GOD. We will
experience new happenings for which we will want to sing a new song.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is changing in
my life that I am finding difficult to accept? How can I turn more fully to the
Lord Jesus and trust that GOD is my strength and GOD will see me through the
most trying and difficult transitions in my life? What can I do to help other
people who are going through changes in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, our Rock in the midst of a
turbulent torrent. Through Your GOoDness, You wish to bring us a sense of joy
even in the midst of our trials and sorrows. You allow us to experience
instability in our lives to remind us that You are the firm foundation to which
(to Whom) we must cling. We ask that through the continued presence of Your
Holy Spirit in our lives, we will be able to release that to which we had been
accustomed, so that we can hold on to our faith and trust in You. You have sent
You Son to us to remind us that we will have to weep and mourn, but that our
weeping and mourning will give rise to joy as we experience His presence in our
lives. We pray for all those who are facing changing times that can lead to
frustration and even anger. We ask that they may sense Your healing presence in
their lives, so that they will be able to sing a new song to You, giving You
all the praise and glory that is due. We make this prayer through Jesus, our Lord
and Master-Teacher, Who is Your Son and our Brother, Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.

<p class=MsoNormal>May 30, 2025  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of Sixth Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Joan of Arc</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> Readings:  Acts 18: 9-18;         Psalm 47: 2-3, 4-5,
6-7;        John 16: 20-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Giving and sharing life can be a real pain.  This thought
runs through our readings.  We are being called to give life to others, even if
it means pain for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading we hear that St. Paul stays in Corinth
for at least a year and half.  He seems to have a GOoD response from most of
the Gentile people in the community, at least those who accept the faith.  He
does meet some opposition from some of the people in the Jewish sector.  They
go so far as to bring Paul to civil court accusing him of “influencing the
people to worship GOD in ways that are against the (Jewish, and possibly civil)
law.”  The civil magistrate will have nothing to do with this dispute among
religious groups.  Paul eventually realizes that he must move on and continue
his missionary travels.  It is hard for him to say goodbye and have to start
over somewhere else.  It is a real pain for him, but he is willing to follow
the Lord Jesus’ direction, so that others might hear about the life that comes
from Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel’s continuing account of His Last Supper
Discourse, Jesus tells His disciples that they will go through an experience similar
to a woman giving birth.  The pain of labor is difficult, but the woman’s grief
is turned to joy as she sees the life she has carried within her becoming a
life separate from her.  So, in a similar way Jesus’ followers will go through
rough times as Jesus suffers and dies.  Yet when He rises to life, His
followers will experience a joy that no one will be able to take from them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I think about my own life, and
I ask myself a question:  Am I willing to suffer rejection or pain in order
that others might have a more wholesome life? It is not easy to put myself out
in such a way that I might have to suffer.  Yet, that is what I am called to do
as a disciple of the Lord Jesus, my Master, Who was willing to suffer and die
in order that I and all people might have life and joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does it mean for me in a practical way? I must be
willing to sacrifice a little more of my time and energy in order that others
might experience the joy of the GOoD News of Jesus.  Again, that does not mean
that I have to preach the Gospel with eloquent words, but I must provide an
atmosphere in which others can be in touch with a loving Abba-Father, Who
happens to be GOD.  They need to be able to experience the joy and life of a
loving Brother Who has already given His life for them.  And sometimes the only
way in which they will be able to experience that joy and full lifeis in the
way I care for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was talking to one of my co-workers.  I mentioned that I
personally found it hard to understand the attitude of some of the people in
the Middle East.  I know I have not had the lifestyle that they have had to
endure.  As we discussed the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, my
co-worker said:  “The Code of Hammurabi is alive and well in the Middle East.” 
[The Code of Hammurabi gave us the phrase “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth.”]  It is obvious that the concept that flows through the Gospel of
“turning the other cheek” [Matthew 5: 39] or “giving your shirt as well to the
one who asks for asks for your coat” [Matthew 5: 40] is not the operating
principle of so many people in the Middle East (or elsewhere).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father Richard Rohr, OFM, writes about the Cosmic Egg, which
has three domes or layers.  The innermost layer is that of personal interest
that he calls “My Story.”  The next dome is that of group identities and
loyalties, that Rohr calls “Our Story.”  Most people, especially those whose
only relationship is their tribe or group operate within this second dome.  The
third dome is “The Story.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the level of ultimate truth that “saves us from the
illusion of ‘we’ and the smallness of ‘me.’” (Richard Rohr, OFM, Things Hidden
- Scripture as Spirituality, pp. 20-23)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I see that the GOoD News of Jesus is challenging me to think
of giving to others before satisfying my own needs – not that I should never do
GOoD things for myself, but that my first priority should not be selfishly
placating myself.  It is important that we become the best person we can be and
to fulfill</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ourselves, but it cannot be at the expense of others.  This
is operating within the third dome, “The Story.”  We are to live life fully,
but we are not to force others to suffer for our pleasure.  It is not easy –
especially in the world in which we live today when we are bombarded by
advertisements that speak of self- indulgence - “My Story.” or following the
party line - “Our Story.”  You may have also experienced the news during the
pandemic, of people not wearing masks or venturing out in large groups and not
keeping social distancing, because they said, “I should make the choice for
myself of what I do and not be forced to do what some mayor or governor or
doctor says about doing what is best for others.”  Yet the message I hear today
is that I must be willing to give life and joy to others even if it means some
pain for me.  After all, look at the pain our Master-Teacher endured for our
sake.  And Jesus promises today that if we do His will, our hearts will rejoice
with a joy no one can take from us, and our heavenly Abba-Father will give us
what we need. Thus, we will be part of “The Story” that is “GOD’s Story.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  To whom and in what
way can I give a positive sense of life? How much pain am I willing to endure
to bring that positive sense of life to that person?  What loving service can I
perform today that will enhance someone else’s appreciation for a GOoD life? 
How do I strike a GOoD balance between fulfilling my dreams and being of
service to others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever desirous of what is GOoD for
us.  Through Your GOoDness, You promise to give us life and joy.  We so often
misunderstand this to mean that we should seek our own pleasure first.  Yet,
through the example of Your Son, You have shown us that giving life to others
often means pain for us.  We ask to be guided by the wisdom that flows from
Your Holy Spirit so that we can know how we can more effectively bring Your
message of joy and life to others.  Give us the strength we need each day to be
willing to share with others, in some way, the GOoD News You have given us. 
May others experience the joy and life You want them to have by our caring and
serving them.  We ask this through Jesus, our Master-Teacher, Who has given us
an example of loving service, and Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia.  <a

<p class=MsoNormal>Feast of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Replacing the readings of Sat. of the 6th Week of Easter)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Visitation:   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Zephaniah 3: 14-18A     or      Romans 12: 9-16;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah 12: 2-3, 4bcd,
5-6;                                         Luke 1: 39-56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Feast of the Visitation takes precedence over the
readings for Saturday of the Sixth Week of Easter. Today’s celebration recounts
Mary’s visit to her cousin Elizabeth.  It reminds us of the importance of
personal relationships between people and the need to be positively and
joyfully involved in the lives of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two options for the First Reading.  I have chosen
the passage from Romans (12: 9-15) rather than Zephaniah 3: 14-18a. The
selection from Romans for the feast of the Visitation encourages us to share
unconditional love (αγαπη - agape) to one another with mutual affection
(φιλαδελφια - philadelphia - love of friend or relative), to show honor, to
rejoice with those who are joy-filled, and to mourn with those who are sad. 
These words are reflected in the lives of both Mary and Elizabeth.  Both women
are concerned for the other.  They sensed the presence of GOD in each other. 
They are willing to be joyful for the other person and to place the other
person ahead of themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People who are not self-centered seem to be able to detect
the specialness of others.  They are aware of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s movement in the lives of other people.  From the first
moment that Mary hears that her cousin Elizabeth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is pregnant, she knows that she should go and assist her aging
relative.  Even though Mary has just been told that she is to be the mother of
the Messiah, she desires to help Elizabeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel recounts their meeting.  As Elizabeth greets
Mary, Elizabeth and the child within her experience the presence of the Holy
Spirit. Elizabeth is in her sixth month of pregnancy, when a new mother often
feels the movement of their baby in her womb.  John the Baptist leaps within
the womb of his mother, Elizabeth.  Elizabeth, like Mary, does not focus on her
own privileged position of having a child (a blessed and special child), but
she acknowledges the specialness of her younger cousin.  Elizabeth proclaims
that Mary is truly blessed among all women because of the Child within Mary’s
womb.  (Remember that Mary was still early in her first trimester and would not
be “showing” yet.)  Elizabeth respectfully remarks, “And how could this happen
to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary, in turn, praises GOD for the great things that are
happening.  She rejoices in the GOD Who comes to save.  And she announces that
her specialness is not because of her own doing, but because of the
magnificence of GOD Who lifts up the lowly and the humble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we look at people today, we can find very few people
whose lives are marked by the same sort of humble and gracious concern for
others as exhibited by Mary and Elizabeth.  Most people are concerned about
self-esteem and self-betterment.  They seek only what will benefit themselves. 
So few individuals, especially those who consider themselves as important, are
willing to think of others before themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the qualities exemplified by both Mary and
Elizabeth, I call to mind the example of others who have lived an
other-centered life.  I think of people like Saint Teresa of Calcutta (aka
Mother Teresa).  I also think of an individual whose funeral I attended a while
ago.  This individual was remembered as a person who constantly tried to give
to his wife, his children, and extended family, and to his community.  He was
well thought of by the members of his family who spoke at the service and
obviously by many other people who also spoke  about this man – this man who
thought of others.  One of the speakers talked about how this individual
started his own business because he did not like the philosophy of most schools
and businesses in which he had worked. The speaker said something like, “Most
people develop contacts to improve their business – with people being a means
to a better business and more money.  His attitude was the opposite.   He used
his business to better people’s lives.  His consulting business was a means for
him to relate to, and to help people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize as I ponder the selflessness of individuals like
Mary, Elizabeth, Mother Teresa and the friend who died, how much I personally
have missed the mark. Sometimes I can be gracious to people, especially when it
is my choice.  It is much more difficult to give of my time and attention to
others when they are expecting me to be generous in my concern for them.  I
find it particularly hard to think of others when others seem to have little
regard for me and only want what I can do for them, especially when they could
do it themselves.  It is at these times that I have to be more conscious of the
presence of the Holy Spirit in the other person and within myself.  It is
important for me to be able to acknowledge andpraise GOD for what GOD is doing
in the lives of the other person(s) and in my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul’s words in our First Reading are a GOoD examination
of conscience.  As I read over all the marks of behavior that are mentioned, I
focus on the one which I need to work on the most.  The challenge before me
today is to do what St. Paul says in the letter to the Romans:  “Anticipate one
another in showing honor.”  I need to be respectful of others, even when they
are not respectful of me.  That’s the issue on which I need to work. And with
GOD’s help, I can be a servant to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  On which of the
many marks of behavior that are mentioned in the selection from Romans do I
need to focus?  How can I anticipate another in showing honor today?  Who in my
family or in my work environment is in need of my help and reassurance and how
can I “visit” them with my loving presence and attention and how can I remind
them of GOD’s presence with them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever caring.  Through Your
GOoDness, You give us examples of women and men who are role models for our
lives.  Today we focus on Mary and Elizabeth.  These two women manifested a
true concern for others, even at a time in the lives when they could rightfully
focus on themselves.  We thank</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You for the graciousness of these two individuals who cared
enough to go out of their way to anticipate each other’s need and in showing
respect.  Pour within our souls the gifts of patience, mutual affection, and
caring so that we can rejoice with those who are joy-filled and weep with those
who are sad.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus (Your Son and the Son of
Mary), Who has come to us because of Your great love and the obedience and
graciousness of His loving mother, and it is He, Who is living and reigning
together with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.  <a href="#Content"><b>BACK</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>June 1, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seventh Sunday of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from: 
https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/060125-sunday.cfm St. Justin:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-justin-martyr/
Readings:  Acts 7: 55-60;                                           Psalm 97:
1-2, 6-7, 9;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Revelation 22: 12-14, 16-17, 20              John 17: 20-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just a note:  In Acts 1: 1-11, it says that Jesus remained
with His disciples for forty days after His resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the fortieth day Jesus ascended into heaven.  Some
communities celebrated Jesus’ ascension on the fortieth day of Easter, last
Thursday.  Others celebrated the Ascension of the Lord today.  This reflection
is for the Seventh Sunday of Easter for those who celebrated the Ascension of
Lord last Thursday, May 29. 2025.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unity could be called the theme of the readings today. 
Unity demands effort, but unity brings a sense of peace.  In our First Reading,
we hear of the first Christian being martyred.  As St. Stephen is being stoned,
he prays the first prayer addressed to Jesus in scriptures, a prayer to be
united with Jesus through his death.  The Responsorial Psalm speaks of the
unity of all peoples as they praise LORD GOD Who is ruler of all the world.  In
our Second Reading, St. John shares the message of Jesus, the Alpha and the
Omega, Who is coming soon to unite all people.  In the Gospel, Jesus prays to
His Abba-Father and asks that His followers be one, just as Jesus and His Abba
are one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stoning of St. Stephen is the first in a few ways.  It
is the first</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>martyrdom of a believer in Jesus.  During his stoning,
Stephen prays the first prayer addressed to Jesus.  Stephen also, like Jesus
before him, prays for those who are mistaken in their drive to martyr him,
including a certain Saul who will later become St. Paul, the Apostle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the Gentiles.  Stephen senses a connection, a union, with
Jesus and even with those who are part of his persecutors.  His being a witness
(martyros) unites him with all who will be martyrs after him,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>including Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today is a hymn of praise of the LORD GOD Who
rules over all.  Not only does GOD rule over all, but all peoples see</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s glory and raise a song of joy over what GOD does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. John concludes the Book of
Revelation with Jesus’ promise that, as the Alpha (Beginning) and the Omega
(End), He is coming soon to unite all who call upon Him.  The only response we
can say is the prayer, “Come, Lord Jesus!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is part of Jesus’ Last Supper Discourse (John
chapters 13-17).  Today’s pericope is part of Jesus’ prayer for His disciples. 
He speaks of the unity He has with His Abba and asks that the same unity include
His union with His disciples, not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>just at the time of the Last Supper, but all who will follow
Him in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>future, including us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Unity” does not necessarily mean “uniformity.”  Yes, we are
asked to put on the mind of Christ Jesus (cf. Philippians 2).  The key aspect
of “unity” is the focus of looking beyond oneself to GOD and to other humans
and to all creatures.  Our GOD is a union of three persons:  Abba-Father,
Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.  That union is always other-focused.  That is that
type of unity we must seek to establish with our One GOD, and with all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who are children of our One GOD, and all of GOD’s creation. 
We are not to think first of ourselves and what we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>want or what we can get out of being joined with others.  We
must endeavor to reach out and assist others, especially those in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have just celebrated the Ascension of the Lord Jesus. 
Jesus had to leave the earth.  Some may say that might have caused a sense of
being un-united.  But the opposite is true.  Jesus’ earthly departure was to
lead to a greater sense of unity between humans and the One GOD, for at His
ascension, Jesus promised to be with His </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>followers everywhere they went and for all time as they went
out and shared His GOoD News with others and brought them into the Unity of the
One GOD (Matthew 28: 16-20).  And the sign of this continued Unity will be
celebrated next Sunday on Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descends on Jesus’
followers, empowering them to continue the ministry of Jesus by going out
inspired with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, as we come to the last week of this Easter Season, we
are called, commissioned, and sent to bring a greater sense of Unity between
all humans and our Triune GOD, and between all humans, and with all of GOD’s
creation.  We continue the ministry and mission of the Second Person of the
Blessed Trinity Who has always been One with His Abba-Father in the Unity of
the Holy Spirit.  Jesus continues to pray for us and promises to be with us,
especially as the Holy Spirit leads and guides us.  We are to work for uniting
of all peoples with the One True GOD so that we can share in the Unity for all
times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am including a reflection on Jesus’ Prayer for His
Disciples (John 17) at the end of this reflection. I also suggest you read and
reflect on Philippians chapter 2.  May you be guided in your time of pondering
these scripture passages and may it lead you to a great sense of the Unity to
which we are called to have with our One GOD - Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit - and
with all humans and all of creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I sense the Lord
Jesus praying for me so that I can go out and serve and bring unity to the
people in my world without becoming worldly? How have I experienced the GOD
being one with me and me with GOD? What has been the greatest experience I have
had of feeling the Holy Spirit empowering me to reach out and to proclaim the
GOoD News and work for the Unity of all? What else might the Lord Jesus be
asking of me at this point in my life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Abba-Father.  Through the
life, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Your Son, Jesus, You have
shown us what it means to be One within Yourself as the Triune GOD and One with
us.  Jesus was always proclaiming His union with You and Your love for us by
His actions and words.  We pray that You and Jesus will continue to send Your
Holy Spirit upon all Your faithful people so that we can continue the work of
Jesus and share the GOoD News, first by our actions, and as needed, by our
words. Help us to live out our union with You in a way that invites others to
be One with You and with us.  We make</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this prayer in and through Your Son, Jesus, our
Master-Teacher and Lord, Who prayed for us on the night before He died and Who,
together with Your Holy Spirit, continues to intercede for us and empower us to
be faithful disciples.  To You be all glory, honor, and praise, together with
Jesus and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD forever and ever.  Amen. 
Alleluia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Justin:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-justin-martyr/</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 1: 1-11;                                                                            Psalm
47: 2-3, 6-7, 8-9; Ephesians  1: 17-23   or Hebrews 9: 24-28; 10:
19-23;           Luke 24: 46-53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just a note:  In Acts 1: 1-11, it says that Jesus remained
with His disciples for forty days after His resurrection. On the fortieth day
Jesus ascended into heaven.  Some communities celebrated Jesus’ ascension last
Thursday (on the fortieth day after Easter).  Others celebrated His ascension
today, Sunday (as many dioceses in the United States).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are in a community which celebrated the Solemnity of
Ascension last Thursday, you will use the readings from the Seventh Sunday of
Easter today.  I am sending a reflection on those readings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus remained with His disciples only a relatively short period
of time after His resurrection.  In the passage from the Acts of the Apostles,
St. Luke says it was forty days.  The other gospels accounts relate that Jesus
only was with His followers on some occasions during those forty days, not
consistently day after</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>day.  Today, we have a couple accounts of Jesus’ last words
to His disciples before He returned to His Abba-Father in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question for us is, “what is the meaning of the
Ascension?”  Or more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>practically, “how am I going to live my life differently
because of the Lord’s Ascension?”  To be able to answer that, we need to look
more closely at the readings for today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles, St. Luke
remarks that after Jesus had spent forty days presenting His Risen Self to the
disciples.  He promised them that they would be “baptized with the Holy Spirit”
and be His witnesses starting in Jerusalem and spreading throughout the world. 
As Jesus ascends into heaven, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples stare into the skies, shocked and perplexed until
two white-clothed individuals ask them the questions, “Why are you standing
there looking into the sky?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from St. Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians speaks
about GOD giving a Spirit of wisdom and revelation to believers so that they
can have fuller knowledge of Jesus and they can realize the hope to which they
are called – a hope of an inheritance with Jesus, a share in His glory in
heaven, and a part in His Body, that is the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The alternate Second Reading from the Letter to the Hebrews
speaks of Jesus’ position now in the presence of His Abba in order to present
our needs to His Abba and to wait until the end of time when He will return to
take all “those who eagerly await Him” back into the heavenly presence where He
is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage today from the end of St. Luke’s Gospel,
Jesus speaks of empowering His disciples so that they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>could preach His name to all nations.  In some of the other
accounts of Jesus’ ascension, Jesus also promises that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He will be with His followers always, even until the end of
time (cf. Matthew 28: 16-20).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this says to me is that we are called and empowered to
continue the work of Jesus.  This is not just the call of the ordained clergy
or parish staff.  It is the call of each and every follower of Jesus.  Each of
us, as disciples of the Master, are given the ability, and responsibility, to
further the spread of the GOoD News.  As</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>members of the Body of Christ (the Church), we are gifted
with what we need to further the mission of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We often ask, “How can I serve in the proclamation of the
Gospel?” We think that because we have not been trained or because we have not
dedicated our lives to missionary work that we are not going to be responsible
for the ministry of spreading the faith.  In some ways we are like the
disciples who today look up in the heaven as Jesus is taken from their sight. 
We are awestruck by what we have experienced.  We often just spend time looking
up to the sky with our mouths wide open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we need beings dressed in white appearing to us
saying, “Why </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are you standing there looking up into the sky?”  We need to
be challenged to quit standing around, doing nothing, and to get to work
spreading the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can take a little consolation in the fact that it took
the disciples at least ten days to get motivated.  And it was only after they
received the further outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost that they were
able to get moving in their mission of furthering the Gospel.  What we need to
do is to continue to pray for the coming of the Holy Spirit into our lives. 
The coming of the Holy Spirit, by the way, is not just a one-time thing.  It is
a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on-going process.  The more we are open to the Spirit’s
presence in our lives, the more we will be empowered to be Spirit-filled individuals
and become the missionaries whom we are called to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being missionaries does not mean we have to sell all our
belongings and move to some far away land to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spread the faith, although some may be called to do this. 
Missionaries literally means “those who have been sent” or those “on a
mission.”  Maybe we are being sent as “far away” as our own home.  We may be
called to announce the GOoD News to our family members.  The way we announce
the message is by living lives of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD News.  It may be the hardest audience to whom we can be
sent.  We may truly need the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to announce the GOoD
News, because our family knows who we really are, with all our failings and all
the times we have “missed the mark” (sinned) in living out the Gospel.  It can
be a real challenge to be evangelists (proclaimers of the GOoD News) to our
family, because it is so easy to forget our mission, due to the day-to-day
needs they and we face, both alone and together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is why we need to keep turning to the Lord and praying,
“Send us Your Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of us who are trying to be
faithful.  Inflame in our hearts the fire of Your love.”  What can help us is
the realization that we have been given, and are continuing to be given, the
Spirit of wisdom and revelation which enlightens us to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the hope of the call that Jesus has given us (see the Second
Reading).  If we strive to live out our missionary call, especially to those
whom we encounter each and every day, then Jesus promises us a share in His
inheritance, with the other holy ones, and the surpassing greatness of His
power.  We will share in His ascension at the end of our earthly life and even
more so at the end of time when we will be raised up to be with Him in glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: In what ways am I
like the apostles in my standing around looking up to heaven, wondering what is
happening without doing anything? To whom in my life is it most difficult to be
sent and to minister?  Which gift/fruit of the Holy Spirit (knowledge, wisdom,
understanding, peace, joy, discernment, hope, faith, love, endurance, being in
awe of GOD) do I need the most at this moment in my life? How can I more
faithfully proclaim the GOoD News to those to whom I am sent?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever desirous of our being with
You. Through Your GOoDness, You have called us to share in the mission of Your
Son, Jesus, Who has come to announce the GOoD News of Your love for each and
every person. We often stand in awe looking at the glory of Jesus. Yet, You
call us to not just stand looking up to heaven, but to begin the action of
spreading the GOoD News we have received. You promise to enable us and empower
us by the continual outpouring of Your Holy Spirit. We come into Your presence
today and pray, “Come, Holy Spirit! Come with Your gifts of knowledge and
wisdom, discernment and right judgement, with strength and humility.” We need
to be inspired (“in Spirited”) and made enthusiastic (“in GOD”) so we can
proclaim the values of the Gospel by our living Gospel lives. Give us the
ability to be faithful to the GOoD News, especially as we proclaim it to those
in our families, in our workplace, and wherever You lead us. As always, we make
this prayer in the name of Jesus our Master and Teacher, Who has called us to
be His disciples and Who has promised us the Holy Spirit, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.
Amen. Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 19: 1-8;           Psalm 68: 2-3ab, 4-5acd,
6-7ab;          John 16: 29-33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The life of a Christian is not always easy.  Sometimes we
think we have these faith ideas down pat, but then we are challenged.  The
challenge may be when we think we have it all together, but we still fail to be
aware of what it really means to be a believer because we have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not let the Holy Spirit fully come upon us (as some of the
people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in today’s First Reading).  At other times, we may be
tempted to turn our back on Jesus and other believers and run away by ourselves
(as Jesus predicted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would happen to His disciples in today’s Gospel).  No matter
what, GOD is always willing to be there for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage from the Acts of the Apostles, Paul speaks to
some of the people of Ephesus.  They thought they were believers, but they had
only been baptized with the baptism of John the Baptist and had not received
the Holy Spirit by being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and the
Trinity.  After receiving the Trinitarian baptism and having Paul lay his hands
on them, they received the gifts that flow from the Holy Spirit’s indwelling
(or presence) in them.  Paul then remained with them for three months,
continuing to teach them and trying to bring more people to the faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel’s continuation of the Last Supper Discourse,
Jesus deals with His disciples who think they have a handle on the whole issue
of faith.  They think they know it all.  Jesus questions them, “Do you really
believe?”  He predicts that due to His upcoming arrest, trial, and execution,
they will all run away and be scattered.  Jesus, however, does not fear because
He knows He is one with His Abba-Father.  Jesus also reassures His disciples
that even though they will eventually have to be martyrs (“witnesses” to the
point of death), Jesus has ultimately won the victory for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today challenge me to look more closely at my
own faith.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>realize that I have not always allowed the Holy Spirit to
fully work in my life.  I have often thought, “Now I have it.  Now I know what
it all means.”  It is then that something comes my way that shows that I don’t
have it all together.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>maybe someone challenging me about an aspect of my faith. 
It may be when something does not go the way I expect.  I start to doubt.  I
wonder about my relationship with GOD.  I question the presence of the Holy
Spirit in my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus never promised that being His disciple would be easy. 
There are movements in the world that make it difficult to be a believer.  Sometimes
we question or doubt.  We are tempted to presume we have a firm grasp of what
it means to believe, and therefore think we do not need any further guidance
from the Holy Spirit.  Or we may be tempted to say, “This is too much for me; I
give up.”  I have received emails during the worst days of the worldwide
sickness, the change in climate and weather conditions from drought and massive
storms, the upheaval </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and war in Ukraine, the increased costs in almost everything
we buy, and people scared of being victims of random killers.  The people
questioned how a loving and merciful GOD could allow such things to attack the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I should do is once again come to the Master-Teacher
and sit at His feet.  I need to listen to His every word, anxiously straining
to take in everything He says.  I need to pray for the continued outpouring of
the Holy Spirit.  My prayer, not just in this week before Pentecost but every
day, must be:  “Come, Holy Spirit.”  [I am reminded that when I went to
Catholic boarding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>high school, we used to pray before every class, “Veni, 
Sancte Spiritus” - “Come, Holy Spirit.”]  It is only when I am moved by the
Holy Spirit that I start to put things back in perspective.  It is only when I
actively use the gifts and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>harvest that flow from the Holy Spirit (wisdom,
understanding, discernment, patience, love, joy, peace, awe, reverence,
kindness, gentleness, self-control, endurance in the face of suffering, etc.),
that I start to have the courage to face whatever comes my way, for I will experience
that Jesus has overcome everything that the world throws at me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No, it is not always easy to be a faithful disciple.  We are
challenged</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>throughout our journey.  We lack the full understanding of
the ways of GOD.  Jesus knew that it would happen. He predicted it.  Yet, He
also knew what would get us through – the Holy Spirit (the Paraclete, the
Advocate). Let us continue to turn to our Abba Who happens to be GOD and to our
Master-Teacher and ask for the continued gift of the Holy Spirit, today, tomorrow,
on Pentecost, and throughout our life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How often do I
consciously turn to the Holy Spirit and seek the rich harvest and gifts that
flow from the Spirit’s presence in my life? Which gift or fruit of the Holy
Spirit do I need the most at this time in my life (wisdom, understanding, right
judgment, courage, knowledge, reverence, wonder and awe, love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, GOoDness, faithfulness, gentleness, humility, or
self-control)? How can I manifest and give witness today that I have received
the Holy Spirit, and that the Holy Spirit is active in my life?  What can I do
to help bolster the faith of others and reassure them of Holy Spirit’s action
in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all wise and all knowing. 
Through Your GOoDness, You desire that we come</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to a further understanding of You and Your relationship with
us, in and through Your Son, Jesus, by the working of the Holy Spirit.  It is
with the confidence that Jesus gave (and continues to give) us, that we can
pray:  “Send us Your Holy Spirit, the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the
Spirit of right judgment and courage, the Spirit of knowledge and reverence,
the Spirit of wonder and awe in your presence” (Isaiah 11:2).  We ask that we
may be given from the harvest that flows from the Holy Spirit (love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, GOoDness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control
[Galatians 5: 22-23]).  We ask that as our Master-Teacher has taught us, and as
He has promised us the presence of the Paraclete – the Holy Spirit, we may take
what we have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>learned and live it, share it, and teach it to others, so
that we may all be inspired and enthusiastic as we seek to follow the Lord
Jesus on our journey to You, our Abba-Father, Who happens to be GOD.  We make
this prayer in the name of the same Lord Jesus, Your Son, our Master-Teacher,
our Savior, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 20: 17-27;         Psalm 68: 10-11,
20-21;          John 17: 1-11a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings today parallel each other in that they are the
final words addressed to followers of a leader who will soon be leaving them. 
St. Paul addresses the faithful in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), telling them
that he will probably never see them again, at least on this side of death.  
In the Gospel, Jesus prays for His disciples on the night before He dies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the account from Acts, having been guided by the Holy
Spirit, Paul realizes that his ministry-mission to the people in Ephesus and
other parts of Asia Minor is over.  He bids farewell to them, informing them
that he does not fear the imprisonment and persecution that probably await him
when he returns to Jerusalem and beyond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm ties the two readings together by saying that GOD
“controls the passageways of death.”  Both Paul and Jesus know that even though
they face death, it is all for the greater glory and honor of GOD.  Doing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s will, even if it is difficult, gives praise to GOD and
is for the benefit of those whom they serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus concludes (over the course of this
week) His Last Supper Discourse in chapter 17 of John’s Gospel.  This chapter
is Jesus’ prayer to His Abba-Father, asking GOD to be with His disciples as He
takes leave of them through His death and eventual ascension back to the house
of His Abba, Who happens to be GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I recall the many times I have
had to say “GOoD bye” to family and friends, some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of whom I knew I would not see again this side of death.  It
was never easy.  What made it bearable was the trust I placed in a GOD Who
loves.  Separation from loved ones is part of life – part of death and new
life.  Coming to the end of loving service to those for whom we have cared is
not a pleasant activity; even thinking about it can cause emotional strain. 
This has been brought forward during the pandemic of the last few years and
world tensions, when people have not been able to say their proper farewell to
loved ones because of the threat of spreading the virus or meeting their own
death.  Yet, if we can have the attitude of Jesus on the night before He dies,
or that of Paul as he takes leave of those to whom he has given spiritual
birth, we can move forward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul is aware that earthly life is not the be-all and
end-all of existence.  He feels blessed if he has completed the course laid out
for him by GOD.  Sure, he would like to stay in a community of the faithful
whom he had brought into a closer relationship with the Lord Jesus.  Yet,
guided by the Holy Spirit, he knows he must move on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ final gift to His disciple is the prayer of blessing
for His followers.  He prays that they (and we) will experience the closeness
to GOD that comes from continuing His ministry of announcing GOoD News. Jesus
gives glory to His Abba as He hands over His mission to His disciples
(including us).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because of the death of my parents and other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relatives, and close friends and colleagues during the past
couple of decades, I have done a lot of thinking about those with whom I have
been close.  I realize that I will “soon” have to say more “GOoD byes.”  I pray
that my time with them has been a period of helping them realize the full
extent of love that GOD, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our Abba, and Jesus has for them.  What keeps me from
breaking down is the realization that GOD will be glorified not only at the
time of our separation, but when we come together again in the heavenly house
of our Abba Who happens to be GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have been struck with strong feelings during the past few
years as I touch bases with many people whose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>paths crossed mine over the last seven decades.  They have
called back memories of times we shared as we journeyed along the path of
life.  They expressed appreciation for how the Lord Jesus had touch their lives
through my ministry-service-friendship to them.  I realized it was not my
doing, but the work of the Holy Spirit. It is a powerful experience to see how
the Lord Jesus had used the “mentoring” (or “discipling”) I did so many years
ago affect the life of persons even years after I have had to say “GOoD bye” to
the person in face-to-face encounters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us continue to minister to those whom GOD has place
along our path.  Let us pray that they, and we, may come to a greater
acceptance of GOD’s plan.  Let us thank GOD for allowing us to journey with
others as we head to the place that the Lord Jesus has prepared for all of us. 
And let us long for the day when we can give GOD everlasting glory and praise
together in heaven.  Let us join the psalmist today and proclaim:  “Blessed day
by day be the LORD, Who bears our burdens; GOD, Who is our salvation.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>N. B.      I am attaching a link to my reflection on John

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    How well have I
used the time that the Lord Jesus has given me when I have been traveling along
with fellow pilgrims on the way to the heavenly house of our Abba Who happens
to be GOD?  Have I been able to bring GOoD News to them as they journey along
with me?  What can I do to bolster those who are with me on the journey now,
even if we are only traveling together online or for a short time, and also to
give glory and honor to GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving Parent.  Through Your
GOoDness, You desire that all of Your children will someday experience the
fullness of Your reign.  You realize that the path to You is filled with both
joys and sorrows.  You have blessed us with traveling companions as we have
journeyed along the way to You. We thank You and praise You for those who have
accompanied us for part of our pilgrimage.   We thank You especially for
sending Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher, Who prayed for us on the night
before He died, and continues to lift us up to You from His place at Your right
side.  We, like our Master-Teacher, pray for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those whom You have placed in our care.  May they continue
to walk along the path that leads to You.  We make this prayer in the name of
Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who is the Way to You, and Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Angeline of Marsciano:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-angelina-of-marsciano/
Readings:  Acts 20: 28-38;        Psalm 68: 29-30, 33-35a, 35bc-36ab;       
John 17: 11b-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again today, we encounter two individuals in our readings
who have to say their farewells to their disciples.  They realize their time
with their followers is drawing to a close.  They end their sessions with those
who have been close to them for a rather lengthy bit of time by praying with
and for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul bids goodbye to the leaders
and the people of Ephesus and Miletus.  He asks the leaders to continue to
watch over the flock that has been entrusted to their care.  St. Paul speaks of
the hardships and attacks they will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience in the days ahead, once he is gone.  He reminds
them, as he says, of Jesus’ words, “It is more blessed to give than to
receive.”  With that, he prays with them and takes leave of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel (part of the Last Supper Discourse [John
13-17]), Jesus continues His final words to His followers before His death. 
The whole seventeenth chapter of St. John’s Gospel is Jesus’ prayer for His
disciples (which includes us).  Jesus asks His Abba-Father to take care of
those who have been called in Jesus’ name.  He asks that those who will
continue His ministry after He is gone will be made holy in the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These readings, together with the experiences that I have
had over the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>past few years, has given me cause to reflect on saying
“GOoD-bye.”  It is never easy to say our last words to those for whom we have
cared and those with whom we have shared so much time and thoughts.  I have
never done well at saying “GOoD-byes.”  It is hard for me to realize that the
relationships that I have formed are at a point that causes them to change
because of death, people’s separating in distance by moves, changing jobs,
retirement, or because others have chosen to do different things with their
lives and thus will not be as near as they have been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over seventeen years ago at this time of the year, I changed
my position at the school where I had worked.  Although I was still at the same
school,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I left the classroom (at least as much as I had been doing)
and switched to an office.  The room that has been assigned to me for the
previous 23 years was no longer my “home” away from home.  The teachings of
certain lessons were the last I taught.  I cleaned out items that I had
accumulated for nearly a quarter of a century.  It caused me to reflect on the
end of a certain aspect of my life and the beginning of another.  I also had to
say my final greetings, or I was in the process of saying “GOoD-bye” to faculty
and friends who have died recently or who are moving on to other jobs or to
retirement.  Now I am no longer working for the school, since I retired during
the pandemic in the summer of 2020.  Seven years ago, I had to say “GOoD-bye”
to one of my fellow teachers who had been at the school for all the years I had
been there.  He was the last one who had worked at the school before I joined
the staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only thing certain and unchanging in life is not the
proverbial death and taxes, but the love of GOD poured out in Christ Jesus. 
Yes, death (and to a certain extent, taxes) are also a fixed part of life, but
the love of GOD goes beyond death and taxes.  St. Augustine once remarked, “our
souls are restless, until they rest in You, O GOD.”  To put it another way,
“Things are going to change; friends will come and go, but our relationship
with GOD is a ‘for sure’ thing.”  In his letter to the Romans, St. Paul list
all the things that change in our lives or the things that change our lives: 
suffering, hardships, persecutions, famine, nakedness, danger, the sword,
death, life, past, present, and the future.  Then he remarks that none of those
things or absolutely “nothing will separate us from the love of GOD” (Romans 8:
31-39).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One consoling thought for me is that even though I have to
say “GOoD bye” and “farewell” to friends and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>family who have not or will not be part of my life as they
have been in the past, I believe that I will be re-united with them again, all
because of the love of GOD.  I have already experienced this.  Thinking that I
would never see some people again, we have had to say “GOoD bye” to each other,
and then, later, have crossed paths in the strangest of circumstances.  I
received messages from former members of the youth group I directed over 40
years ago.  The Lord Jesus allows us to sometimes make re-connection with those
who had once been a very active part of life.   Thanks to social networking, I
have heard from many friends from whom I had not heard anything for a quarter
of a century or longer.  I have also re-connected with my elementary and high
school classmates, some of whom I had not heard anything during the 57 years
since our high school graduation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of years ago, our Stephen Ministry group had a
guest speaker. She was a woman whose baby died during the last month of her
pregnancy. Unbeknown to the mother, she had chosen her baby’s name on the night
before her little girl died.  She had given her little girl the name of
Trinity.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>grieving mother continues to celebrate Trinity’s birthday
every year and she and her other three children constantly recall Trinity at
special holiday celebrations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are those who have already gone home to be in the
house of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father, Who happens to be GOD.  Even across the door
known as death, they are still close to me, sometimes even closer than before,
because of our being united in the love of GOD.  That does not take away all
the sadness of having to say “GOoD-bye.”  That is why I prefer not to say
“GOoD-bye,” but rather say “A-Dios.”  For as I bid others “A-Dios” I am say “To
GOD” or “In your journeying towards GOD,” thus wishing them a safe journey to
GOD.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am saying also that “In GOD” we will be united, especially
when we all finish our earthly, human pilgrimage, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are one with GOD for all eternity.  So, let us not say
our final departing words to others, let us pray “A- Dios.”  For it is in our
traveling “To GOD” that we are united “In GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Who has/have been
special traveling companion(s) in my journey of faith who no longer is/are able
to journey with me in the same way as he/she/they once did? What have I learned
and experienced during our pilgrimage together that will benefit me and those
with whom I will travel in the future? How can I say “A-Dios” to them and
demonstrate my wish that they complete their journey “to GOD”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  You want us to be
with You in Your house.  At times on our journey there, we get too accustomed
to our surroundings and traveling companions and lose focus on what our destination
is – A-Dios (To [be with You, O] GOD).  We find it hard to come to a point
where we have to let go of a relationship with one or more people who have
journeyed along with us and helped us on our way.  Your Son, Jesus, at the end
of His earthly life, also had to face changes in His relationship with the
disciples. Although He knew He would always be a part of their lives, He also
realized that the way He would relate to them would be different.  St. Paul
faced similar experiences in his ministry.  Through the example of Your Son and
St. Paul, You have reminded us that our focus must always be on heading to
You.  We must say “A-Dios”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to others to remind them and us that our orientation must be
A-Dios – “To [be with You, O] GOD.”  We praise You for giving us those special
people in our lives who have made a difference to us as we have taken the
sometimes difficult steps to You.  We ask for strength to continue along
without some of those who have touched our lives.  We also ask that we may give
inspiration (“breathe the Spirit in”) to others to whom You have allowed us to
minister and serve.  We make this prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus, Your
Son, our Guide and Coach, Who has traveled along the way and prepared a place
for us in Your House, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-boniface</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 22: 30; 23: 6-11;        Psalm 16:  1-2a and
5, 7-8, 9-10, 11;       John 17:  20-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading find St. Paul on trial in Jerusalem. 
Being aware of the differences between Pharisees and Sadducees, Paul emphasizes
that being a Pharisee means that he believes in life after death, and for Paul,
he believes especially in the life of Jesus Who is risen after His death.  This
leads to an all-out dispute between those who believe in life after death (the
Pharisees) and those who do not believe in life after death (the Sadducees).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[An easy way to remember which group believes what is “It is
SAD, YOU SEE, that a Sadducee does not believe in life after death.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The dispute almost ends in physical harm to Paul and some of
the Pharisees and the Sadducees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides the wisdom that Paul exhibits in causing the members
of the Sanhedrin (made up of both Pharisees and Sadducees) to disagree among
themselves, this passage makes me realize how often groups who claim to be of
the same basic faith can disagree about theological issues.  It can be very
frustrating, at least to me, that people argue over issues that are not the key
aspects of their beliefs and miss the major point of being in relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the One Whom they claim as GOD.  The theological and
philosophical differences are not what GOD wants. That is evident in Jesus’
prayer at the Last Supper (part of which is today’s Gospel).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key aspect of Jesus’ prayer is that Jesus is asking His
Abba- Father, Who happens to be GOD, to bless those who faithfully carry on His
ministry of announcing GOoD News of GOD’s love.  Jesus also prays for those who
will be touched by the ministry of Jesus’ disciples.  The key point of belief
as mentioned in Jesus’ prayer is that people come to believe that Jesus was
sent by His Abba Who is GOD, and that Jesus and His Abba are one.  It is also
important to realize, as Jesus prays, that “You [, Abba,] loved them even as
You loved Me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often do we, who call ourselves “Christians,” miss the
point</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Jesus’ prayer.  We argue over issues that are not
essential.  Jesus speaks of His being one with the Abba and the Holy Spirit
(the mystery of the Trinity).  Jesus also emphasizes love as the driving force
of GOD’s message that Jesus has been sent to announce.  That</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the center of our faith.  Instead, we argue about other
issues, whether it be clerical celibacy, ways people are to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be baptized, the number of books in the Hebrew Scriptures
(Old Testament) or how to translate certain passages. Even within our
particular tradition, we have disagreements on the role of women in ministry,
the importance of marriage, the participation of divorced and remarried
persons, the way people are different from us in developing personal
relationships.  We miss the point of Who GOD is and how much GOD loves us.  GOD
loves us more than we can ever know.  In a similar way that Jesus’ Abba has
loved Him, so GOD, Who is our Abba, loves us. We are invited into the
relationship that is GOD – Who is Love.  Pope Francis’ work, Amoris Laetitia
(The Joy of Love), reminds us that we must hold to the teachings of the Church,
but we must care for all with love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I become upset when we want to limit GOD’s love to our human
standards.  Some people think they know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s loving ways better than Jesus knows His Abba’s ways of
loving.  They want to make all sorts of hoops for others to jump through rather
than helping them come into a closer relationship with a loving GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To those people who want to waste their time and energy
arguing about theological and philosophical issues, my response is that I try
to love them as I think GOD loves them.  I listen to them, I try to understand
from where they are coming, but most importantly I care for them as sisters and
brothers in Christ.  I may not agree with all of their points, but I try to
love them as I sense they are loved by GOD.  It does not mean that I water down
my own understanding and my position on my beliefs, but I am not going to allow
our differences to prevent me from loving and caring for them.  I will leave it
up to GOD to set things straight when we are all </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sharing in the fullness of joy and life that Jesus has gone
before us to prepare for us.  (I think some people may find things to be a
little bit different than what they have come to “believe” when we arrive in
the heavenly reign.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I guess one reason I can say this is because of my work in
Stephen Ministries.  Stephen Ministries is an inter-denominational ministry. 
We work at serving the needs of people, not winning them over to our point of
view.  We seek to love and care with the same love we have experienced from
GOD, or as C. S. Lewis describes it, “mere Christianity” (Christianity at its
most basic roots).  We leave it up to GOD to change the minds and hearts of
those who have misunderstood GOD’s teaching.  It is not up to us to force a
theological tenet on them. Yes, we are called to be faithful to the Word of GOD
Who is Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, our first call to faithfulness is to the faithfulness
in the relationship that GOD wants with us and with each and every other
person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us continue to unite ourselves with the Lord Jesus, as
He prays the prayer to His Abba.  This should be the focus of our prayer.  It
is in prayer that we become one with Jesus, His Abba, and all our sisters and
brothers in faith, all through the power of the Holy Spirit.  We should pray
for unity and not seek division.  That is the point of Jesus’ prayer. It should
be ours, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What is the focus
of the way I proclaim the GOoD News of Jesus? Is it just my understanding of
tenets of belief, or is it the loving care that I have received and that I am
been asked to share with others?  Am I more interested in theological issues or
ministry to people?  Who could best benefit from my loving care today?  How can
I profess in action Who my Master is?  How can I encourage others to look
beyond difference in thought and see our unity in Jesus Who is one with His
Abba and the Holy Spirit?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have sent Your Son to us to announce the GOoD News of Your love. 
You have not called us to argue about issues, but to work together to spread
Your Gospel.  Help us to join with Jesus, Your Son, in praying for those whom
You have called to continue the ministry of Jesus.  Let us all, together with
Jesus, pray for all who come to faith in You through the ministry of others. 
You want us to serve our sisters and brothers by sharing the love You have for
them.  We are called to remind them that just as You love Your Son, so You also
love those who follow Jesus.  May we show</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our care for those who particularly need to experience Your
love.  Through the Holy Spirit, may we have the wisdom and understanding of the
Truth and impart it to others in a manner that does not condemn the person. May
we love even the worst sinners, while despising the evil deeds they perform. 
May we be true disciples of Your Son, so that others will come to know Who our
Master is by the way we act – just like the Master.  We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make this prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus, Your Son,
our Master-Teacher, Who prays for us, His disciples, and Who also prays for all
those whom we are called to serve.  It is this Jesus Who is our Brother, and
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of the Seventh Week of Easter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Norbert)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from:  
http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/060625.cfm Saint Norbert:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-norbert/ Readings:  Acts
25: 13b-21;       Psalm 103: 1-2, 11-12, 19-20ab;       John 21: 15-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s First Reading we hear how events are coming
together that will lead to St. Paul being taken to Rome.  GOD has ways of
getting people where GOD wants them to be and doing what GOD wants them to do.
Thus, the circumstances in Jerusalem, Paul’s Roman citizenship, and other
happenings provide the means for Paul’s being sent to Rome, the place where GOD
will use him for the continued spread of the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s Gospel speaks about another man who will eventually
end up in Rome – St. Peter.  This passage takes place near the end of the Risen
Jesus’ earthly time with His disciples.  Jesus asks Peter about the love he has
for Jesus and explains what that means for Peter’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel passage has been interpreted in many ways.  One
way looks at the words used in the passage for terms that are translated with
the English word “love.”  Some scripture scholars say there is no difference to
the way that two different Greek words for “love” are used.  Other scholars see
a great importance to which word is used at what time and by whom.  I will
present the position that the words were particularly chosen to stress the
continuing of St. Peter’s development in his relationship with the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Greek, there are four different words for what we in
English translate as “love.”  Two of these words are used in today’s Gospel
passage.  The two words used today are φιλεω (phileo - I love) and αγαπαω
(agapao - I love).  They both can, obviously, be translated as “love.”  The
word φιλεω (phileo) is usually understood in the sense of loving because one
has a duty of being</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>related to another person, either a family member or
friend.  A form</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of this word is used in Philadelphia, city of “brotherly
love.”  It is a very important type of love.  This is the type of love that
family members have for each other, even if they do not necessarily “like” each
other.  It is a love that comes from a sense of obligation because of a bond or
being in a close friendship/relationship by choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other word for “love” that is used in today’s Gospel is
αγαπαω (agapao).  This is often translated as “unconditional love.”  In 1 John
4: 7, a form of this word is used in the phrase, “GOD is love.”  It is the highest
form of “love.”  It is the type of love that Jesus says His Abba-Father has for
us.  It is the love that caused Jesus to be born, teach, minister, suffer, die,
and rise again.  Aγαπαω (Agapao) is the love that comes from a decision to do
for another without expecting anything in return and without counting the cost
to oneself.  It is the type of love that Jesus speaks about when He says, “No
greater love does anyone have than one is willing to lay down one’s life for
another” (John 15: 13).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having explained the words, let us see how they are used in
today’s Gospel.  Jesus addresses Peter and says,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Peter, do you agapas (do you unconditionally love) Me?” 
Peter responds “Yes, Lord, I phileo You (I love You as a member of Your family
or a close friend).”  Jesus issues a command, “Feed My lambs.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, Jesus repeats the question, “Peter, do you agapas (do
you unconditionally love) Me?”  Peter again responds “Yes, Lord, I phileo You
(I love You as a member of Your family).”  Jesus requests, “Tend My sheep.” A
third time Jesus asks a question.  The word for “love” changes in Jesus’
question.  Jesus says, “Peter, do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>you phileis Me (do you love Me as a member of My family or a
close friend)?”  Peter seems hurt.  He has been asked three questions.  He
responds, “Lord, You know everything.  You know that I phileo You (I love You
as a member of Your family or close friend).”  Jesus gives the final
imperative, “Feed My sheep.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the words were chosen particularly for their special
meaning, this passage takes on an interesting twist, a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>twist that may apply to us.  One way of looking at this
would be that Jesus is asking Peter to show his </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“unconditional love” for Jesus.  Peter, at this point in his
life, can only respond with the love of a close relative or friend.  Peter
cannot make the full commitment of laying down his life for others.  Jesus
again asks for the total surrender by Peter in an act of selfless love.  Peter
again responds with the only type of love that he can promise at this point in
his life.  Jesus finally settles for the second type of love from Peter.  Peter
is hurt, not just by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ questioning, but by his own lack of being able to
give himself totally to Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After each of Peter’s responses, Jesus ask Peter to take
care of His own flock that he entrusts to Peter.  Jesus then goes on to say
that Peter will later have to give himself totally, unconditionally, and
ultimately as a witness (martyros - martyr) to Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From reflecting on this, I realize that I am often like
Peter.  I can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>proclaim my love (philia) for the Lord Jesus.  Yet I find it
hard to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make the full commitment of agape love.  I know Jesus is
asking me to give that unconditional, selfless love (agape).  Yet, I have not
fully grown to the point where I can say that I will always love unselfishly.
Yes, I love the Lord Jesus.  I love my brothers and sisters in the Lord. The
love, however, is still at the philia level.  I want to give more, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am limited in my ability because there is still something
in me that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prevents me from giving unconditionally.  I expect some
return on my loving others, especially the members of my family and those with
whom I work or interact.  My love must be deepened, i.e., changed from philia
to agape type of love.  Obviously, I cannot do it without GOD’s help, since GOD
is agape-love.  I must keep coming back to the Master-Teacher and keep learning
from Him.  With the help of the Holy Spirit, I can strive to be more
unconditionally loving.  This is what I am called to do as a disciple of a
loving Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And one way I can deepen the sense of unconditional love is
the same way Peter did – by his tending to those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>entrusted to his care.  It was by feeding the lambs and
tending the sheep of the flock of Jesus – the GOoD Shepherd, that Peter was
able to change from philia love to agape love.  In his service of others, he
learned how to unconditionally love both the Lord Jesus and those under his
care.  In the same way I, too, can learn to love more unconditionally by my
service of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   With what type of
love do I love my family and friends?  Phileo - love out of sense of
relationship or duty or Agapao - unconditional love? Was there an opportunity
in which I recently failed to show unconditional love?  How have I recently
demonstrated unconditional love for a member of my family or someone with whom
I work or with whom I have come in contact? What can I do to strive to be more
unconditionally loving to those whom I am called to serve?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD and ever-loving GOD. Through Your
GOoDness, You have loved us unconditionally, as seen especially in and through
Your Son, Jesus. You have said that You have sent Your Son into the world
because of Your love for each and every person. Jesus lived a life and died a death
because of His unconditional love for us and for You, His loving Abba-Father.
We ask Your pardon for times when we have not loved at all or not loved fully
and unconditionally. We ask that You continue to send Your Holy Spirit upon us
so that we may have the strength and wisdom to love as You and Your Son have
loved us. As we strive to love others, gift us with the ability to love
completely with agape type of love. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus,
Unconditional Love Incarnate, Who has given us an example to follow, Who is
Your Son and our Brother, and Who is living and reigning with You and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Holy Spirit, our one and only loving GOD, for ever and
ever. Amen. Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Franz Jagerstatter:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-franz-jagerstatter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Acts 28: 16-20, 30-31;            Psalm 11: 4, 5 and
7;             John 21: 20-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we come to the end.  We read the last few verses of
the Acts of the Apostles and the Gospel according to St. John.  It is also the
last weekday (non-Sunday) of the Easter Season.  We reflect on the end of a
special time (the time of Easter, the time of the Apostles).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we close out the Acts of the Apostles, we hear about the
last part of St. Paul’s ministry – the last two years of his life, under house
arrest in Rome.  Paul addresses the Jewish community in Rome speaking about his
being even more faithful to the GOD of the Jews than earlier in his life (when
he was a strict Pharisee and was persecuting Christians).  He asks his
listeners to see Jesus as the hope of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The conclusion of the Gospel of St. John gives us a glimpse
into the life of the author of the fourth Gospel.  He was the beloved of the
Lord Jesus, one who has testified (= gave witness = “martyrized”) to the truth
of what has been revealed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in his Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me as I reflect on the readings is St. Peter’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reaction in the Gospel today. When Peter asks Jesus about
the beloved disciple, Jesus responds,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What if I want him to remain until I come? What concern is
it of yours? You need to just follow me.”  The “concern” of Peter reflects the
human concerns a lot of us have about other people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We so often want to know how we compare to other people. We
want to make sure that we are being treated fairly and equally, or if there is
any inequality, we expect it to be in our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>favor, not the other person.  We sometimes become upset when
others are “apparently” liked by GOD more than we are liked by GOD. 
“Apparently” is from our perspective not GOD’s perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ response is important for us to hear:  “What concern
is it of yours?”  We need to trust in GOD and GOD’s sense of fairness.  Yet, as
humans, we are so often concerned about ourselves and how we are treated.
Rather than rejoicing in how GOD loves and gifts others, we get upset if one
person seems to manifest more talents or gifts or blessings than we have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to realize that it is GOD’s will that everyone uses
the abilities and skills and blessings they have received from GOD for the
edification of one another.  We are not meant to be competing against each
other, but to be working for the common GOoD.  We also need to realize that GOD
will expect more from those who have received more blessings from GOD (Luke 12:
48).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, instead of always complaining about what we don’t have,
or being envious of others who seemed to be more gifted, we should give thanks
to GOD for what we have and see how we can use what we have been given for the
benefit of others.  We should also praise GOD for the talents and abilities GOD
has given to others, especially as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they use those gifts for the GOoD of all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul reminds us that we all have different gifts (1
Corinthians 12 and 13).  He reminds us that the gifts are given to different
people for the building up (edification) of the Body of Christ – the Church. 
We need to reflect on the gifts and abilities GOD has given us and see how we
can use them more effectively in the bolstering of the faith of others.  In
this way we will all be enriched as we share with one another.  This is what
St. Paul did even as he was under house arrest in Rome.  He continued to
proclaim the GOoD News to all who came to hear him speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We should also listen to Jesus’s final message to Peter: 
“Just follow Me.”  If we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and follow where He
leads, we will arrive at our destination – the dwelling place of our
Abba-Father, Who happens to be GOD.  Yes, it is true that we may have to go
through some intermediate places to which we would rather not go, such as Peter
and Paul experienced in Rome.  Yet, if we trust the Lord Jesus and follow where
He leads, we will experience the joys of the place in heaven that Jesus has
prepared for us for all eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I look at the
gifts that others have received from GOD, what is my reaction?  Am I jealous or
envious or do I rejoice in their receiving gifts that edify the Body of Jesus?
When I reflect on my own GOD-given abilities, am I grateful for what I have
received?  How do I use what I have been given for the building up of the Body
of Jesus (the Church)?  How can I more faithfully follow Jesus today in the
building up of His Body?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever caring and always giving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have blessed each of us in unique ways so that we
can help others along the way as we journey to You.  Help us to appreciate the
special talents and abilities of others and not question what they have or what
You have called them to do. Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, helps us
develop the special gifts You have given us so that we can be of assistance to our
traveling companions on the path of faith.  May we give You all the glory and
praise as we see the ways You have graced others.  We make this prayer in the
name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Our Master Who leads us and asks us to
follow Him.  It is this Jesus Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.  Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Acts 2: 1-11;      Psalm 104: 1, 24, 29-30,
34;     1 Corinthians 12: 3b-7; 12-13;      John 20: 19-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>N. B.      I have chosen to reflect on the readings for
Pentecost Sunday rather than the readings from the Vigil of Pentecost and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second Reading from 1 Corinthians rather than Galatians. For
the Gospel I chose the reading from John 20: 19-23. .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate Pentecost – the coming of the Holy
Spirit, the birthday of the Church, the end of the Easter Season. Our readings
speak of the gift of the Holy Spirit and what that means for the Church, i.e.,
us.  Today is all part of the paschal (Easter) mystery.  In fact, the Gospel
reading comes from a Resurrection appearance on Easter Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading from the Acts of the Apostles, Luke
relates the coming of the demonstrable presence of the Holy Spirit.  The
passage says that “they” [Mary, and the disciples of the Lord Jesus (including
other women)] are gathered together behind lock doors as the image to right
pictures the event.  Their Master and Teacher left them ten days ago, when He
ascended into heaven.  They are not sure what they should do.  They are scared
and confused. They have been promised that something special would happen. 
They wait with guarded optimism. [I like the image showing Mary and other women
besides the apostles.  I believe the “they” includes all the disciples
including Mary and other women.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of the sudden they hear something that sounds like a
powerful wind.  They sense the unseen power in their midst. They are
enlightened with tongues, as of fire, appearing over their heads.  Their fear
fades away and they have renewed strength, courage, and wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A parallel event happens in the Gospel.  John gives us
another account of the coming of the Holy Spirit on the disciples of Jesus. 
This takes place on Easter Sunday evening.  Just as in the Pentecost story in
the First Reading, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples of Jesus are gathered together behind lock doors. 
They sense an emptiness due to the absence of their Master and Teacher, Who was
crucified three days before.  They are confused and not sure what they should
do.  They are afraid to even go outside because they might be arrested.  They
have been promised that the presence of the Lord Jesus would be made manifest on
this, the third day since His death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of the sudden Jesus stands before them.  He comes in
power and glory.  They sense Jesus’ abiding presence.  They start to put things
together and realize they have nothing to fear, especially after Jesus speaks
His first word to them: “Shalom!” Jesus then breathes on them and gives them
the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is amazing in both these accounts is the change that
takes place in the lives of the disciples after receiving the gift of the Holy
Spirit.  They become transformed individuals who are willing to step out in
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other more subtle parallels in the two accounts. 
One of these subtleties is the concept of Ruah, the Hebrew word for “Spirit.”
Ruah also has other meanings: “Breath” or “Wind” – a power that cannot be seen,
but whose effect can be experienced.  This Ruah is the Ruah of GOD, the Breath
of GOD that GOD breathed into the hunk of clay –  adamah – at Adam’s creation,
giving him life (Genesis 2: 7).  This Ruah is the Spirit of GOD that (Who) blew
the Red Sea apart at the time of the Exodus (Exodus 14: 21).  This Ruah is the
breeze that (Whom) the prophet Elijah experienced when he was told that GOD was
near (1 Kings 19: 12).  This same Ruah is breathing new life into the disciples
of the Lord Jesus making</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them strong, bold, and determined to carry on the work of
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Spirit of GOD (Ruah YHWH – Πνεύμα του Θεού [Pneuma tou
Theou]) blows where the Spirit wills.  The Spirit transforms and gives life. 
The Spirit is not seen directly, but the Spirit is powerful in the ways the
Spirit manifests the presence of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul, in the Second Reading (from 1 Corinthians) today,
speaks about how the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit affects the Church.  It is by the power of the Spirit
that believers can profess that </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Jesus is Lord.” It is the Spirit Who gives different gifts
of service so the Body of Christ (the Church) can be edified (built up) and
served.  The different forms of service that come with the manifestation of the
Spirit are for the benefit of the whole. We are all united in the common drink:
the drink of the one Spirit  ἓν πνευμα – hen pneuma).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I continue my faith journey, I am more and more impressed
by the presence of the Holy Spirit in my life and the people around me.  I am
aware of GOD’s Spirit with me at times when I am writing these reflections or
listening to a person who is sharing their problems with me.  I might write
something or say something.  I think to myself, “Wow! Where did</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that come from?” I know it is not me who came up with it.  I
realize the power of the Holy Spirit has used me to provide the words to the
person who needed to hear the words that came out of my mouth or onto the
monitor as I write, but the words were not really my words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another example of the presence of the Holy Spirit is the
gathering (assembly – ekklesia – church) of GOD’s people, not because we have
to gather, but because we want to gather.  Years ago on Pentecost Eve, I
experienced that when the faith community gathered for a funeral.  The church
was filled to overflowing. We came together to lift up one of our members who
had died and passed from this earthly life to the place prepared for him by Our
Lord Jesus, in the home of our Abba- Father Who happens to be GOD.  We also
came together as a support to his wife and to the family of the one who had
passed on.  Through the tears and fears, we sensed the presence of the Ruah of
GOD as we sang and prayed and rejoiced in the life of the one who was now
joined with the Risen Lord.  A feeling of empowerment and challenge came upon
us to carry on the ministry of the Lord Jesus as was manifested in the life of
the one who had died, the one who had reflected, in various ways, what being a
disciple of Jesus is all about – loving and caring service of others.  The Ruah
of GOD was evident and alive in the gathering in the church.  We felt the
presence of GOD’s Spirit, comforting, strengthening, consoling, and inspiring
us to remember and continue the work of Jesus, even as we grieved over our loss
of, and physical separation from, one of Jesus’ followers here on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are only a few examples of my awareness of the
Spirit’s presence in my life.  There are many more.  When I am</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aware of the presence of the GOD Who is manifested in any
one of three persons, it is then that I know what it means to be gifted by the
Ruah (the Spirit) of GOD.  The experience comes, and I know that I am in
relationship with GOD.  It is not my doing – it is gift from GOD.  That is what
it means to be spiritual.  It has nothing to do with me (other than my being
aware of it), it has everything to do with the Holy Spirit of GOD.  It is
transforming, empowering, enlightening. It is an awesome experience.  And this
awareness of the Spirit’s presence in our lives is something that each and every
one has been promised.   This is the gift that Jesus has left us.  Let us
continue to pray, “Veni, Sancte Spiritus! – Come, Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced the Holy Ruah–Spirit of GOD breathing life into me? How did I feel
at that moment? What was the result of GOD’s Spirit being made evident in my
life? What gift do I wish to receive from the Holy Spirit at this time in my
life? How can I make use of this gift in the spread of Gospel (GOoD News)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You LORD GOD, ever one, yet also three. Through
Your GOoDness, You manifest Yourself in so many ways, desiring that we be aware
of Your presence in our lives. You come as Creator and loving Parent. You have
come in flesh as our Master and Teacher, Who suffered and died for us. You come
as the Ruah Who blows life into us and empowers us to walk the journey with
others who are on the path to You. You breathe Your very being into our being
and make us holy. We thank You for revealing Yourself to us so we can draw
closer to You. We ask that You continue to come as Holy Ruah–Spirit so that we
can use the gifts You have given us for the edification and building up of the
Body of Christ. May we work together to help one another as we travel along the
path that leads to You. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and
our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brother, Our Master, Who is one with You for ever and ever,
for You are our one and only GOD: loving Abba, Risen Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, and Holy Ruah-Spirit. Amen. Alleluia!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 3: 9-15, 20   or    Acts 1:
12-14;          Psalm 87: 1-2, 3 and 5, 6-7           John 19: 25-34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nota Bene:         On March 3, 2018, Pope Francis formally
announced that the from that year on, the Monday after Pentecost</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would be the Required Memorial of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
Mother of the Church with the readings listed above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings remind us of the role of Mary in the life of
not only Jesus, but also of the Church – the Body of Christ.  We see Mary’s
role in giving birth to the One Who would defeat evil by His dying on the
cross, the platform from which He gave His mother to His disciple (and to all
disciples) and also gave His disciple and all members of the Church to His
mother.  We also have a glimpse of Mary’s role with the early Church as she
prays with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the reading from Genesis, after the sin of Adam and Eve,
GOD speaks of the tension that will exist between the offspring of the serpent
(the [d]evil) and offspring of Eve.  One of Eve’s descendants will give birth
to a Son Who will battle with the offspring of the (d)evil and He will be
injured in the battle, but will win the ultimate victory over (d)evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other alternate First Reading (from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Acts of the Apostles) gives us one view of Mary’s participation
in the beginning of the Church.  She gathers with the apostles and other early
disciples and prays with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is “Glorious things are told of you, O City
of GOD.”  Mary has been linked to the City of GOD because in her dwelled the
GOD-Man, Jesus. As the psalm says, “One and all were born in her, and the One
Who established her is the Most High GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is the account of Jesus’ death on the cross from
St. John’s Gospel.  As Jesus looks down from the cross, He sees His Mother and
His beloved disciple.  He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gives them to each other.  This symbolizes Jesus giving His
mother Mary to the Church and the Church to Mary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With this festival of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the
Church, we are reminded of Mary’s role in bringing forth the Savior of the
World and her position in the Church.  I am reminded of a movie that was
co-produced by Jon Kondrath of ReKon Productions and ODBFilms.  The film is
entitled,  Full of Grace.  The writer of the script spent a lot of time researching
the part Mary played in the early Church and how she must have had a positive
effect in the Church’s growth.  The apostles, especially St. Peter and St.
John, went to Mary and listened to her advice on the early spread of the
faith.  Mary was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>respected in her role of bringing Jesus into human existence
and guiding His early upbringing.  She is also sought</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>out for her thoughts on how the early disciples needed to
guide the young Church in its early years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church has always respected and honored Mary.  Believers
have called upon Mary to intercede with her Son, Jesus, since she has always
been close to Him.  It is the teaching of the Catholic Church that Mary was
assumed into heaven with both her body and soul and is ever at Jesus’ side, and
she presents her motherly concerns for all who believe in her Son and for all
people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are blessed to be able to celebrate this new Memorial of
Mary, Mother of the Church, on the day after Pentecost.  How fitting is it that
on the day after the celebration of the beginning of the Church and the descent
of the Holy Spirit, that we gather and ask Mary to continue to guide us, the
Church, in fulfilling our role of proclaiming the Gospel at all times, and if
necessary, using words.  Mary is a great example of one who did just that.  As
a priest I know reminds his parishioners, we only have four times in the Gospel
where Mary speaks, but her actions model what it means to be the first disciple
of the Lord Jesus.  We can learn from the four occasions </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of her speaking out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first time Mary is quoted is during the Annunciation
when she says, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord.  Let it be done to me
according to your word” (Luke 1: 38).  In this she humbly submits to GOD’s will
of being the Mother of the Savior.  She does not fully understand what it
entails, but she is willing to do what GOD is asking of her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Visitation is the second time Mary’s voice is heard. 
After a short dialogue between herself and her aging cousin, Elizabeth, Mary
then proclaims the beautiful prayer called the Magnificat.  In the prayer she
exclaims, “My soul proclaims the glory of the Lord and my spirit rejoice in GOD
my savior. . .” (Luke 1: 46-55).  She declares how great is GOD and she gives
thanks for all that GOD is doing in her life.  She also demonstrates her
gratitude to GOD and her profound sense of humility by staying and helping
Elizabeth for three months.  She</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who is to be the Mother of the GOD-Man – Jesus, focuses not
on herself but on assisting someone who needs her</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next time we hear Mary speak is when her youthful Son
stays in the Temple in Jerusalem while Mary and Joseph look for Him for three
days.  Her words to Jesus are:  “Son, why have you done this to us? Your father
and I have been looking for you with great anxiety” (Luke 2: 48).  She
demonstrates her loving concern for Jesus and willingness to help Him look
intently on what He needs to focus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary’s last quoted words in the New Testament are at the
wedding feast at Cana.  There she simply mentions that there is no more wine. 
She then speaks to the servants saying, “Do whatever He tells you.”  She knows
that Jesus will assist and that the servers need to do what is asked of them by
Jesus” (John 2: 5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary’s words and her actions throughout the life of her Son,
Jesus, demonstrate her connection with Jesus and with those to whom He
ministers and those who minister in His name.  She is filled with humility and
loving actions.  These virtues continue to be manifested throughout the New
Testament as we hear in today’s readings. And they do not stop there.  Mary is
still interceding for the Body of Jesus – her Son and all who are joined to
Him.  Thus, we can call upon Mary as the Mother of Church (the Body of Christ)
as we celebrate today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How do I see Mary’s
role as the Mother of the Church? What qualities of Mary do I seek to emulate:
humility, servant attitude, praying for others, loving concern, obedience to
the will of GOD, another quality not listed?  For what do I seek Mary’s
intercession with her Son?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, for in Your Divine plan, You
chose Mary to be the Mother of Your Son, Jesus. She is the model of
discipleship-servant-leadership in her willingness to do Your will and provide
loving care for Jesus.  From the cross, Jesus gave Mary to John, and all His
disciples and all believers to Mary.  We honor Mary as the Mother of the Church
and call upon her to intercede on our behalf so that we can be faithful
followers of Jesus.  Help us look to Mary and her loving care and follow her
example of humility, obedience, and acceptance of Your will.  We make this
prayer to You in the name of Jesus, Your Son and the Son of Mary, and through
the intercession of Mary.  To You, loving Abba-Father, through Jesus, in the
unity of the Holy Spirit, be all honor, glory, and praise; for You, the Most
Blessed Trinity, are our one and only GOD for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

Joachima:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-joachima</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 1: 18-22;        Psalm 119: 129,
130, 131, 132, 133, 135;       Matthew 5: 13-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants us to respond by saying “Yes.”  GOD is saying
“Yes” to us in and through Jesus and His ministry. St. Paul tells the
Corinthian community that GOD is the GOD of “Yeses.”   The Gospel passage is a
familiar passages.  Jesus tells His disciples:  “You are the salt of the earth.
. .You are the light of the world.”  We are tempted to say, “Been there, done
that, heard it before.”   Yet, saying “Yes” to Jesus’ statement that we are
salt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the earth and light of the world means that our actions
must reflect the “Yes” that we profess with our mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul recalls the Semitic language
roots of certain words.  The following English words used by Paul in today’s
readings all have the same root (mn) in Semitic languages (Hebrew, Aramaic): 
faith, amen, security, yes, firm. Paul is saying that GOD is the GOD of mn. 
GOD is faithful, GOD is “yes,” GOD is firm, GOD is secure.  GOD is the Great
Amen.  GOD is the “So Be It!”  GOD always is positive in whatever GOD does. 
GOD has promised us a share in the divine life.  We have received the first
payment (the gift of the Holy Spirit through Baptism).  GOD continues to say
“Yes” to us through Jesus.  Jesus is the Great “Yes” Person when it comes to
responding to His Abba-Father.  We are called to respond with our own “Yes,” “I
believe,” “Amen.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Turning to the Gospel, I hear Jesus’ words:  “You are the
salt of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>earth. . .You are the light of the world.”   I am reminded
that I can and should have a positive (“Yes”) effect on others.  I should enhance
the flavor of their lives, and help enlighten their journeying.  Yet, so often
we only leave a bitter taste with people and seem to cast a darkness and gloom
over them.  What can I do bring the richness of their flavor out? I can
genuinely and positively affirm – say “Yes” to – them for the GOoD they do, or
better, the GOoD they are, because of GOD’s love for them and in them.  It
takes work, but we can find something GOoD in others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we look, we can express our appreciation for their being
who they are,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their living out, at least in some way, their being loved by
GOD. Maybe a few examples will help.  I try to thank people for doing what they
are supposed to do.  When a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>student turns in her or his required work, I thank the
student for doing that.  When someone greets me as they pass, I acknowledge
them and express my gratitude that they said “hello” to me.  When someone does
something, I try to honestly and authentically compliment them, even if it is
only for the effort they put forth.  I am acknowledging them for their
existence – their being persons loved by GOD.  When someone (parent, student,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>co-worker, relative, friend) emails me, I usually respond
with an email acknowledging the receipt of their email and thanking them for
writing me, even if they are only requesting something of me, or sending me a
complaint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings are very affirming.  They reminds us that GOD
is the GOD of “Yes.”  GOD desires our wholeness.  GOD is willing to heal and
forgive so that we will give the most complete affirmation of faith by our
praise of GOD’s glory not only now, but also in the reign of heaven.  GOD wants
us to experience the divine Yes of salus (wholeness, health, well-being,
salvation).  The fullness of that salus awaits us in heaven, but we can begin to
experience it right now.  We need to turn to the GOD of “Yes” and ask for
salus.  Our bodies may have to wait to experience the fullness of physical
salus, since they are locked into the limitations of life here on earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is amazing how shining a little light on a situation can
change a person’s attitude.  Taking the time to ask</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people how they are doing before I share my ideas or
requests of them, can make a difference.  How often we </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have something on our minds, we walk up to a person, hardly
acknowledge their existence, and start to tell him/her what we are thinking
about, or we ask them to do something for us.  How much more enlightening and
affirming it is if we honestly check in with them to ask if they have the time
to hear what we would like them to hear.  There are all sorts of ways in which
we can be light to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the key phrase at the end of today’s Gospel is very
important:  “Your light must shine before others, that they might see your GOoD
deeds, and give glory to GOD.”  Our sincere, hospitable caring for others is a
way of giving glory to GOD – of saying “Yes” to GOD.  This is true,
particularly if we say a little prayer or offer our attitude to GOD as a gift
of praise.  Others will be blessed by GOD because of our being concerned for
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants to say “Yes” to what is most important in our
lives – salus (wholeness, healing, salvation).  GOD has promised that to us. 
All we need do is humbly come before the Lord Jesus with a contrite heart and a
desire to be people of faith, people of saying “yes,” – Amen people.  Let us
confidently shout, “Amen, Amen!  I believe! Let it be!  Yes, Lord!  Amen!”  In
this way we will be salt to the bitter tasting world and light in the darkness
of people’s lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How have I
experienced someone else’s being salt (enhancing the GOoD taste in my life) and
light to me (enlightening me with loving care)?  What was the experience like
when they took the time to acknowledge me and make me feel that they cared
about me? How can I enhance the GOoDness of another person and shed light on
his/her being a person loved by GOD? Can I be more affirming (“yes-ing”) of the
GOoDness in that person?  When I am affirming, do I sense the glory being given
to GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, source of all GOoDness and
light.  Through Your GOoDness, You call us to examine our lifestyle in the
Light of Your Love.  We so often hear Your Word and fail to reflect on how Your
Word should affect our lives.  We also take others for granted and fail to
realize how we can be a source of light and enrichment to them.  We say “No” to
You and others and leave a bad taste in others’ mouths, we leave them in the
dark rather than letting Your light shine through us.  Yet, if we turn to You,
You enable us to be salt and light to others, to be people who willingly say
“yes.”  In our being salt and light to others, we allow them to experience Your
blessings in their lives.  Our attitude towards others can also have an
enriching and enlightening effect on us as we experience You in those whom we
meet.  Help us to take the time to savor Your Word and experience Your
enlightening presence in others.  May we be “Amen – Yes” people and follow the
example of Your Son.  For we make this prayer in the name of Jesus, our
Master-Teacher and Lord, Your Son and our Brother, Who is the Great “Yes” to
You, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD for ever and ever.  Yes.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Barnabas:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-barnabas/</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 11: 21b-26, 13: 1-3;        Psalm 98: 1,
2-3ab, 3cd-4, 5-6;       Matthew 5: 17-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s plan includes the proclamation of the GOoD News to all
who will listen and exert a willingness to reach out to others in a clear and
firm way. Today’s readings give us an insight into that plan.  Since today is
the Memorial of St. Barnabas, our First Reading gives us an account of the call
and ministry of Barnabas.  In the psalm we hear that GOD’s message of salvation
is revealed to all the nations.  In the Gospel (for Wednesday of the Tenth Week
in Ordinary Time), Jesus announces that He is the fulfillment of the old
covenant and the institutor of the new covenant (testament).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Barnabas, an early believer in the Lord Jesus, seeks out
Paul in Taurus and brings Paul back to Antioch where they minister together. 
After a year of sharing the Gospel in Antioch, the leaders of the assembly
(church) in Antioch, directed by the Holy Spirit, send out (“apostle”) Paul and
Barnabas to be missionaries and to spread the faith.  There is also a comment
that it is at this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>place and time that followers of this faith for the first
time are called “Christians”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– “Christ-like people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm gives us a foretaste of the spread of GOD’s
message to all the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>world.  Although the Israelites believed they were chosen by
GOD, they also sensed (at least the psalmist did)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that through them, GOD’s message of salvation would be heard
by all nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus announces that He has not come to
destroy the Old Covenant and the Word of GOD as proclaimed by the patriarchs
and prophets.  Rather, He has come to bring all that was promised to
fulfillment.  Jesus condemns those who do not uphold the GOoD News that began
in the Hebrew Scriptures.  He also praises those who teach and share the Word
of GOD with others.  Yet with His coming, and particularly with His death and
Resurrection, He has fulfilled the Old and can bring about the New Covenant
(relationship) with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that GOD is sending</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(“apostling”) us to be ambassador of GOD’s love, forgiveness
and honesty.  An ambassador must fully manifest the ideas of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One Whom the ambassador represents.  An ambassador is not to
act in way that contradicts the intentions of the One Who has sent the
ambassador. That means we are to “walk the talk.”  We are to be people who act
the way we believe, and we are to do it at all times.  If we are Christians –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christ-like individuals – disciples of the Lord Jesus, we
must live in a manner that demonstrates our commitment to the teachings of
Jesus.  If we truly believe that we have received</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness of sins through the death and resurrection of
Jesus, then we should not only live grateful lives because GOD has forgiven us,
but we should model and reflect that forgiving attitude in our lifestyles. 
Thus, if we sense there is any conflict between us and another person,
particularly if the other person is a fellow believer, then we must resolve the
conflict before we continue our proclamation of the GOoD News.  If we don’t,
people will see that we do not act like our Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, like Barnabas and Paul, are called to be ambassadors of
Jesus and to realize that, through the Holy Spirit, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are sent to continue to announce the GOoD News of Jesus. 
If Jesus is the Truth, we are called to reflect truthfulness in all we say and
do.  Our very lives should be messages of blessedness/joyfulness, light to
others, and “enhancers” of the True Bread of Life.  People should not have to
try to figure out the Truth that we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bringing to them.  There should be no question from those to
whom we are sent concerning what our mission and purpose is:  we are
ambassadors of GOD, we speak GOD’s message, even in the midst of the trying
events of their lives and our lives, like the social unrest, killing of
innocent people, or global tensions.  We should not have to emphatically
punctuate when we are speaking the Truth by swearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People should be reminded of the qualities of GOD when they
encounter us and by the way we are treat them. They must know that GOD is
comforting and merciful, and that GOD seeks peace (and reconciliation) in other
people’s lives because we are willing to mourn with others, extend them kindness,
and be peacemakers and reconcilers.  We should manifest the fact that we aware
that GOD has lifted our lives from our former ways of sinfulness to the higher
level of sharing in the life of GOD, even if that means suffering for the sake
of the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That should also include our being understanding and
forgiving of those who have harmed us.  We should not live lives that imply
that we are better or “holier” than others, especially than those who continue
to sin.  Yes, we should be willing to condemn sin, but at the same time show
that we are humble and meek in the presence of our GOD and that we can live as
the children of GOD and members of the Reign of GOD, because we have
experienced the blessedness of being in relationship with the Lord Jesus and
the forgiveness we need for our own sinfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being an ambassador demands that we are fully, honestly, and
completely committed to the One Who has sent us.  That is not always easy to do
so, particularly if we still hang on to old ways of sinfulness and evil.  Yet
the One to Whom we owe our loyalty is asking for complete allegiance.  We must
commit our whole being to the Lord Who has commissioned us as His own
ambassadors.  We must never forget what our GOD has done for us as we bring
GOD’s message to others.  We must be people who speak the Truth in love at all
times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Can people
experience the blessedness of GOD by the way I treat them? How can I live out
my calling to speak the Truth – in love – and be one who is sent as an
ambassador of the Lord Jesus? Whom in my life might need me to speak the Truth
in love and reconciliation to them today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, Most blessed and holy, ever
compassionate and always Truth-filled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through Your GOoDness, You “apostle” (send) us to be Your
ambassadors of blessing and joy, just as You sent out (“apostled”) Barnabas. 
Even though we have chosen to respond to Your invitation to bring Your message</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to others, we sometimes display a lack of total commitment
as we fail to be as merciful and peace-seeking and forgiving as You call us to
be.  For the times we have failed to be Your authentic ambassadors, we once
again ask You to extend Your forgiveness to us and to continue to remind us of
the presence of Your Holy Spirit in our lives.   Through the power of Your Holy
Spirit, help us to be fully committed to the message of our Master- Teacher,
Jesus, Your Son, Who is the Truth.  Help us to bless Your Name with our whole
being, especially after we have been reconciled with anyone who may have
anything against us or with anyone against whom we have any disagreements.  To
You be all glory, honor, praise, and blessing, in and through Your Son, Jesus,
our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one GOD for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Jolenta (Yolanda) of Poland:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-jolenta-of-poland</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: 2 Corinthians 3: 15–4: 1, 3-6;       Psalm 85: 9ab
and 10, 11-12, 13-14;        Matthew 5: 20-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are reminded of two key aspects of being a disciple of
the Lord Jesus.  The first is to reflect the light that comes from Jesus, Who
is the Light.  The second is to be sure we are reconciled with others, and we
do not cause conflict or division with others.  In other words, we are called
to be in proper relationship with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul speaks to the people of Corinth and compares the
Gospel message he is preaching to the message proclaimed by Moses.  When Moses
approached GOD for a message, the glory of GOD was seen in the face of Moses. 
Yet, over time, the glory of GOD faded from Moses’ face.  Moses wore a veil to
prevent the people from both seeing the full impact of GOD’s glory on the face
of Moses and from realizing when the glory of GOD over time was decreasing its
hold on Moses.  St. Paul describes the glory of the Lord Jesus is only veiled
from those who are not able to believe because they have been prevented from
doing so because of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>evil in the world.  For those who believe, the full glory of
GOD shines through the proclamation of the GOoD News.  Thus Paul is not the
source of glory, he only reflects the glory of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up the theme of the glory of GOD shining
upon others.  GOD’s plan is that divine glory be manifested in the world.  With
that glory comes peace, kindness, truth, and justice. These attributes are ways
by which the presence of the glory of GOD is known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His “Sermon on the Mount.” He
challenges His disciples to a higher level of behavior than that of the
religious leaders of His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time.  Not only is murder unacceptable, but no sort of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>division or conflict between a disciple and another person
is not to be tolerated. And if some sort of discord occurs, it must be
addressed, and reconciliation must be sought, before one attempts to come into
the presence of GOD to worship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that following the
Lord Jesus is demanding.  Being a disciple of Jesus requires us to live in a
way that reflects Who the Lord Jesus is and what He desires from His followers
– a positive, edifying relationship with GOD – and with others.  If we are to
reflect the glory of GOD, people must be able to see the love and compassion of
GOD shining through us.  If GOD is a GOD of relationships, then people should
experience what a great thing a holy relationship is.  It is then that people
can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be in each other’s presence and have a sense of GOD’s glory
because of feeling</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>peace, kindness, truth, and justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That requires that we exhibit those qualities in the way we
treat others.  It does not mean that we water down what we believe, but that we
respect where</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a person is in their faith journey and be willing to express
the Truth in ways that will help the other come to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accept the full glory of the Lord Jesus.  They must
experience GOD’s loving care through us in the same way that people experienced
it from the Lord Jesus as He walked on earth 2000 years ago.  Jesus raised the
standards of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>caring and loving to a much higher plane than did the
prophets before His time.  He not only spoke words that called for a more
caring approach of being in relationship with others, but also Jesus
demonstrated that concern for others in His very way of dealing with others. 
His actions touched people where they lived, and His deeds were so inviting
that people wanted to be a part of what He offered.  This was true for most
people, except those whose eyes had been shielded behind the veil of falsehood,
deceit, and selfishness, whether the veil was self- imposed or imposed by
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, as disciples of the Lord Jesus, we must do as He did,
so that others will experience Him in the way we act.  If there are strained
relationships in our lives (whether it be because of us or because of the other
person[s]), we must seek to be reconciled.  All this should be done before we
attempt to stand before the Lord Jesus and offer worship to Him.  For we would
be as big a hypocrite as the religious leaders in Jesus’ time, if we go</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through the outward appearances of rituals and inwardly
harbor hatred of, or envy for, those who cross our paths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, being a disciple of the Lord Jesus is very
challenging.  It demands that we seek to be in a relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with others – establish a friendship that flows from our
being in contact with the Lord Jesus.  With some people it is difficult to have
such a relationship, but with GOD, all things are possible.  This is especially
true if we are fellow believers and the Lord Jesus is the Lord of both of us,
for we will be united in the Lord.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Are there any
relationships in my life that need to be healed and on which I can start the
process of healing by taking the first step? Have I blocked the healing process
by lack of forgiveness of someone who has hurt me?  Is there someone whom I
have hurt and with whom I must seek to restore a relationship? Do I reflect the
glory of GOD to those whom I meet without my even saying a word? How can I be
more proactive in reflecting GOD’s glory to others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, ever loving and caring, You
invite us into a closer relationship with You in and through Your Son, Jesus. 
As we draw ever nearer to You, You also call us to be in relationship with
those around us.  Jesus has set a higher standard of being concerned for others
than merely avoiding murdering or killing others.  Jesus asks that we lovingly
care for and relate to others, not just as passers-by, but as members of the
same family.  In order that we might be able to strive for such a level of
behavior, You sent Your Son not only to proclaim the need for caring for
others, but also to model the way of caring for others.  Helps us to
continually look to Him as our example.  With the inspiration of the Holy
Spirit, may others experience Your glory in and through us as we reach out with
justice, peace, joy, and truth.  As always, we make this prayer in and through
Jesus Christ, Your Son and our Brother, Who is in loving relationship with You
and with all those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whom You have called to be Your daughters and sons.  It is
He who is living and reigning with You and the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Anthony of Padua</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(readings from Fri. of the 10th Week in Ord. Time)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Anthony of Padua:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-anthony-of-padua</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 4: 7-15;         Psalm 116: 10-11,
15-16, 17-18;         Matthew 5: 27-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings speak about the weakness and frailty of
human nature, yet the exalt position to which GOD’s love can raise human
nature.  Saint Paul uses the image of an earthen vessel that can contain a
valuable treasure.  The psalm announces that no human is dependable, yet GOD
sees each person as precious in the divine eyes.  In the Gospel, Jesus comments
about the human laws that have been made to appease humans, yet the divine
calling to which GOD calls mortals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In comparing humans to clay containers, St. Paul emphasizes
that what makes us valuable is not our outward appearance or our own intrinsic
value – for we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are no more than hunks of clay (adamah – in Hebrew).  Our
preciousness comes from what we are able to have within us – the very life and
love of GOD.  Paul enumerates the difficulties he, as a human, has endured. 
Even in mentioning all the negative events (affliction, perplexing situations,
and persecutions), Paul is not dismayed.  He knows that he is united with the
Lord Jesus Who Himself suffered.  In some ways Paul bears Jesus in his
suffering body and is united with Jesus through his suffering.  It is Paul’s
hope (not idle wishing, but conviction) that he will be joined with the Resurrected
Jesus because he has been united with Him in his trials.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist looks at all that is happening with humanity.  
He sees that worldly values only lead to a sense of the lack of dependability
from others. The psalmist holds out a word of encouragement, not from being in
contact with other mortals, but from being faithful to the GOD Who sees each
believer as precious because GOD’s life dwells within him/her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus remarks about the Mosaic law allowing
for divorce. Divorce is not a divine institution, but a human concession based
upon the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>inabilities of mortals to live up to GOD’s plan of
permanency in marriage, a permanency that reflects the unconditional bond of
love that exists between GOD and those who fully respond to GOD.  Jesus once
again raises the standard above that set by the Jewish ancestors in the faith. 
Relationship with GOD, especially the eternal relationship in the next life, is
much more valuable than attachment to human bonds or even to body parts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings leave me both saddened and also hopeful.  Mere
mortal existence is limited in what brings a sense of purpose and joy. 
Trusting in fallible human beings and their fickle ways leads only to
disappointment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and pain.  If all we have is what we experience in limited
human relationships, we will be hurt.  This bad news can be a source of
disillusionment and despair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is, however, GOoD News.  GOD enriches human life with
divine life.  Yes, we are earthen vessels, but we are able to have within us
the treasure of GOD’s own existence.  If GOD is dwelling in us, we become </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>valuable, not in and of ourselves, but because GOD has
chosen to reside within us.  This lifts us up from the base position of being
only hunks of molded clay to being valuable vessels in which GOD abides.  If
GOD is with us, any negative experiences we encounter are insignificant in
comparison to the joy and richness that is within us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we focus on the treasure we carry, we will be able to
echo the words of the psalmist and say, “O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your
servant, the child of Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds.  To You will I
offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, and I will call upon the name of the LORD.  My
vows to the LORD I will pay in the presence of all GOD’s people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I hear Paul’s
words describing himself (and us) as an earthen vessel, what thoughts go
through my mind?  What is it that gives value and meaning to the hunk of clay
that I am?  How can I give proper respect to the other earthen vessels in which
GOD has chosen to dwell?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, source of all richness. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have chosen to enhance our value by dwelling within
us.  Without Your being with us, we are no more than the hunks of clay from
which our bodies have come and to which our bodies will return.  As You have
breathed Your Spirit within us, we become vessels of great value, for You
enrich us with Your presence.  We seek pardon and forgiveness for failing to
appreciate the value You bestow on us by Your indwelling.  We ask that we may
be useful vessels in Your service and bring to others the wealth that You
intend others to have.  May we continue to offer You glory and praise and
thanksgiving for the value You have given us in and through Your Son and the
Holy Spirit.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother
and Savior Who has died and is risen and Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Albert Chmielowski:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-albert-chmielowski</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 5: 14-21;          Psalm 103: 1-2,
3-4, 9-10, 11-12;           Matthew 5: 33-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a disciple of the Lord Jesus requires many things of
us.  Our First Reading speaks about our role in the process of reconciliation
of other disciples and non-believers to the Lord Jesus.  The Gospel calls us to
avoid swearing and challenges us instead to give simple affirmation or negation
statements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul reminds the Corinthians, and us, that because Jesus
has come and reconciled us to His Abba-Father, we are part of the process of
reconciliation.  Yet, we are called to be more than the recipients of
reconciliation – we are commissioned as ambassadors of reconciliation.   As
people who have experienced forgiveness, we are sent out to announce and share
the gift of pardon and forgiveness with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist describes the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reconciliation and pardon that come from GOD.  GOD is full
of kindness and mercy.  Once GOD has forgiven us, GOD separates</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us from our sins.  As far as east is from west, so our
wrongdoings are from us, and so should the gap continue to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Swearing, as a sign of honesty, has been around since
ancient times. Jesus objects to people who swear by GOD and things related to
GOD. GOD is not to be invoked as the guarantee of our honesty.  We should be
people who are dedicated to the truth at all times.  Our affirmations or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>negations should be simply stated and should be based on the
fact that we are always speaking the truth and do not need GOD to be called
upon only at times we really want others to accept our statements as being
truthful and honest.  The fact of our dealing honestly does not need to be
punctuated by swearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that GOD is calling
us to be ambassador of GOD’s love, forgiveness, and honesty.  An ambassador
must fully manifest the ideas of the one whom the ambassador represents.  An
ambassador is not to act in a way that contradicts the intentions of the one
who has sent the ambassador.  That means we are to “walk the talk.”  We are to
be people who act the way we believe at all times.  If we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples of the Lord Jesus, we must live in a manner that
demonstrates our commitment to the teachings of Jesus.  If we truly believe
that we have received forgiveness of sins through the death and resurrection of
Jesus, then we should not only live grateful lives because GOD has forgiven us,
but also we should model and reflect that forgiving attitude in our
lifestyles.  People should be reminded of the forgiveness of GOD when they
encounter us and experience the loving and Christ-like way we treat them.  We
should manifest the fact that we aware that GOD has lifted our lives from its
former ways of sinfulness to the higher level of sharing in the life of GOD. 
That should also include our being understanding and forgiving of those who
have harmed us.  We should not live lives that imply that we are better or
“holier” than others, especially than those who continue to sin.  Yes, we
should be willing to condemn sin, but at the same time reach out a forgiving
and reconciling hand to the sinner, positively inviting the sinner to turn to
the Lord Jesus and to accept GOD’s forgiveness, along with our willingness to
be forgiving in our dealing with the sinner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only are we called to be ambassadors of reconciliation,
but we are also called to be ambassadors of honesty and of a proper
relationship to GOD.  If Jesus is the Truth, we are called to reflect
truthfulness in all we say and do.  We should not have to swear by GOD and all
that belongs to GOD in order to emphasize our point. Our very lives should be
messages of truthfulness.  People should not have to try to figure out the
Truth that we are bringing to them.  When we mean something, we should say
exactly what we mean, but in a loving way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There should be no question from those to whom we are sent
concerning what our mission and purpose is:  we are ambassadors of GOD; we
speak GOD’s message of Truth. Swearing by GOD implies that the only time we
speak the truth is when we swear.  If people know us as people of the Truth, we
have no need to swear to indicate that we are speaking the truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being an ambassador demands that we are fully, honestly, and
completely committed to the One Who has sent us.  That is not always easy to do
so, particularly if we still hang on to old ways of sinfulness and evil.  Yet
the One to Whom we owe our loyalty is asking for complete allegiance.  We must
commit our whole being to the Lord Jesus Who has commissioned us as His ambassadors. 
We must never forget what our GOD has done for us as we bring GOD’s message to
others.  As we do so,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>then we will be able to echo the words of the psalmist today
and say:  “Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all my being, bless</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s holy name.  Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not
all GOD’s benefits” (emphasis added).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I see myself as
an ambassador of the Lord Jesus? Can people sense the presence of GOD when they
are in my presence? Do I use swearing as a way to punctuate my messages so that
people will listen to me and know that I mean what I say? Are others able to
recognize me as a Truth-filled individual? How can I live out my calling to
speak the Truth – in love?  Who in my life might need me to speak the Truth in
love to them today?  This weekend?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, ever compassionate and always
Truth-filled.  Through Your GOoDness, You apostle (send) us to be Your
ambassadors of reconciliation and truth.  Even though we have chosen to respond
to Your invitation to bring Your message to others, we sometimes display a lack
of total commitment as we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speak harshly and unmercifully to others or as we water down
or interpret the Truth from our own perspectives. For the times we have failed
to be Your authentic ambassadors, we once again ask You to extend Your
forgiveness to us and to continue to remind us of the presence of Your Holy
Spirit in our lives.   Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, help us to be
fully committed to the message of our Master-Teacher, Jesus, Your Son, Who is
the Truth.  Instead of swearing by Your Name or that of Your Son, help us to
bless Your Name with our whole being.  To You be all glory, honor, praise, and
blessing, in and through Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Marguerite d’Youville:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-marguerite-dyouville</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:    Proverbs 8: 22-31;      Psalm 8: 4-5, 6-7,
8-9;      Romans 5: 1-5;      John 16: 12-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings present to us a view of the Most Holy Trinity,
whose solemnity we celebrate today.  The First Reading describes GOD the
Creator begetting Wisdom Who takes part in the process of creation.  The psalm
declares the magnificence of creation and the most blessed part of creation GOD
has given to humans.  In the Second Reading, St. Paul speaks about the gift of
salvation that GOD (the Abba-Father) has extended to us in and through the
Jesus Christ (the Son) and poured out upon us by the love that flows from the
Holy Spirit.  In the Gospel, Jesus promises a further share in the life of GOD
by the presence of the Holy Spirit Who completes the relationship with the GOD
Who is Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Hebrew scripture, Wisdom is portrayed as the only-begotten
essence of GOD, Who is co-existent with GOD from before the creation of the
world.  It is the person of Wisdom Who assists in the process of creation,
joyfully and playfully participating in bringing life to the world.  After the
coming of Jesus, His disciples related the personification of Wisdom to the
“Word made flesh.”  Jesus, the only begotten Son, truly has been eternally part
of not only the creation of the world, but the salvific recreation of humanity
through His life-giving death and resurrection.  Wisdom is also seen by
Christians as one of the essential qualities and gifts of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm praises GOD for so wonderfully creating the world
and for taking particular care in the placing of humans as the care-takers and
climax of created beings.  Humans are not worthy of such an exalted position
but have been graced and gifted by GOD with being in relationship with GOD.  It
is all gift on GOD’s part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul in today’s Second Reading describes a further</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“giftedness” bestowed by GOD upon humanity.  Not only are we
part, and the most gifted part, of earthly creation, we have been given the
hope and promise of salvation (justification and peace) in and through Jesus
Christ.  Although humanity had been estranged from GOD through sinfulness, we
now have the hope of having the peace (relationship) with GOD restored by means
of Jesus’ saving act of death and resurrection.  We have hope.  This hope is
not a wishful desire, but a standing firm in, and living out, GOD’s promise. 
GOD has established a new (peaceful) relationship with us, and GOD will bring
this relationship to fulfillment when we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>share in the ultimate glory of GOD.  We can stand on this
promise because we have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit Who has come
and continues to come, bringing the Love that flows between the three person
of, and from, the Triune GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, as part of Jesus’ last will and
testimony, He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promises to share what He has received from His Abba.  It is
available</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to us as we are open to the presence of the Holy Spirit in
our lives.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, guides us in the Truth
(Wisdom).  We continue to grow in our knowledge of Who GOD is, the very GOD Who
is Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mystery of the Trinity is both simple and complex. 
Simply</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>stated, it is that there is only one GOD, yet that one GOD
is three persons:  Abba-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  The complexity comes
from the struggle our mere human minds have when trying to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>adequately understand Who GOD is.  Yet Trinitarian Life is
not meant to be a problem to be solved or an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understanding to be figured out.  The Trinity and our
adoption into the life of the Triune GOD is a mystery to be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lived.  We are invited to participate in the very being or
essence of GOD and have our lives enriched and lifted up to the divine level. 
In the seventy plus years of my life I have intellectually known about the
Trinity.  But better than knowing about and trying to figure out how GOD is one
yet three, I am called to “know” and “be known” by our Triune GOD.  That
“knowing” and “being known” comes only from living in relationship with our one
GOD Who is Abba, Son-Jesus, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The essence of GOD is the loving relationship.  The
relationship between the three persons of the Blessed Trinity is first and
foremost a relationship within the divinity itself.  The Abba relates to the
Son and the Spirit, just as the Son relates to His Abba and the Holy Spirit, in
turn the Spirit is the relationship between Abba and Son.  Yet the divine
loving relationship is so powerful it has chosen to spill out into creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only is all of creation the result of GOD’s loving
relationship, but GOD has also taken an active role in the continuing
relationship with humanity.  Because GOD graced humans with free will (so they
could freely choose to be in relationship with GOD), humans also have the
ability to (and, in practice, often choose to) refuse GOD’s loving
relationship.  Once again GOD’s loving relationship spills out with a desire to
re-establish the loving relationship with those who have refused to accept
GOD’s gift through their human sinfulness.  It is GOD’s desire for a loving
relationship with each human that led the Son to become human in order to save
us through His teaching, ministry, life, suffering, death, and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s re-establishing the relationship between the Divine
Supreme Being and redeemed mortals is not the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>end of the story either.  GOD has not only saved us through
the Son’s paschal mystery (life, death, resurrection), but GOD has also called
us into the very divine relationship by allowing us to be daughters and sons of
GOD through the workings of the Holy Spirit.  We are adopted into the very
essence of GOD’s loving relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This reflection is not meant to fully explain the Triune
GOD.  It is meant to give each of us the opportunity to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflect upon the relationship GOD desires to have with each
of us individually and as members of a faith family. We are being invited to
not only think about what we have been given, but to live a life that reflects
the gift of Triune GOD.  We are called to immerse (plunge - baptizein)
ourselves in the mystery of being blessed by the name of our GOD – Abba, Son,
and Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I “know” and
relate to GOD as Abba- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? Am I constantly trying to
solve the problem of what the Trinity is, or am I able to live the mystery of
the Trinity by relating to GOD as Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit? What does my prayer
life (how I address GOD) say about Who the Trinity is for me? Am I allowing
myself to be “known” by (relate to, experience) GOD? In what way do I make my
“knowledge” of the Triune GOD evident in my daily practice? Can people come to
know GOD better by my living out my relationship with the GOD Who is
Three-in-One?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, uniquely one, yet also a
relationship of three.  Through Your GOoDness, You reveal Yourself to us over
the course of our human history, inviting us to come into Your relationship –
Your essence.  In Your loving parental care, You have created us.  Yet because
of Your giving us the freedom to choose, we have sometimes chosen to not accept
Your love and therefore have sinned.  In Your continuing love, You have sent the
Son to reveal the relationship that exists within Your very being.  By His
life, ministry, death, and resurrection, He demonstrates Your mercy and
graciousness.  In His human nature, He freely chose to be fully in relationship
with the fullness of Your Triune Being and to fulfill Your plan of salvation
through His giving of Himself completely by dying on the cross and rising from
the tomb.  As a further sign of Your love for us, You have given us the Your
gift of another facet of Your nature – the Holy Spirit – so that we could
continue the mission of Jesus by helping to draw more people into relationship
with You Who are Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit.  We want to give You glory, honor,
and praise and exalt in Your Name – Abba, Son, and Holy Spirit.  We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make this prayer, calling upon Your Name from Whom all love
and life originates, and that of Jesus, from Whom all grace and salvation flow,
and the Holy Spirit, in Whom we have life, fellowship, and communion – our one
and only GOD now and for ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Francis Regis:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-francis-regis</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 6: 1-10;        Psalm 98: 1, 2b,
3ab, 3cd-4;         Matthew 5: 38-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cost of discipleship is the focus of the readings today
as I reflect on them.  St. Paul writes to the Corinthians to appeal to them to
reflect on what gifts they have been given and at what costs.  The psalm is
exhortation to praise GOD for the wondrous deeds GOD has done.  In the Gospel,
Jesus challenges His disciples to give more than what is asked or expected of
them by other people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first ten verses of chapter 6 of St. Paul’s Second
Letter to the Corinthians is one sentence in Greek. – talk about run-on
sentences.  The main verb of the sentence is “we appeal.”   Paul is urging the
Corinthians to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>look at what they have been given by GOD – the gift of
salvation that includes faith.  This gift is to be taken seriously.  It has
cost Paul everything – even though, while giving up and suffering much, he has
gained much and experienced great joy.  In this way he is like the Lord Jesus,
on Whom he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>models his life.  Jesus gave up everything:  wealth, power,
fame – even His life – so that we would be enriched and have eternal life.  
Paul expounds on what his (Paul’s) being a servant-minister (diakonos)
entails.  Paul, like his Master-Teacher (Jesus), has endured rough times.  Paul
has gone through afflictions, imprisonments, riots, labors, vigils, fasts, so
that the Corinthians could experience purity, knowledge, patience, kindness,
being in the Holy Spirit, sincere love, and truth.  The paradox of being a
Christian is exemplified in Paul’s life, for in dying to self, he is truly
living in Christ.  In suffering, he does not die; in pain and sorrow, he
experiences true joy; in giving of all he has, many other people are enriched;
and in his having nothing, he has everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm urges singing joyful songs to the LORD.  The
purpose of this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rejoicing is so that GOD can continue to reveal justice and
salvation to all peoples.  GOD continuously demonstrates divine power in the
wondrous deed that GOD performs.  The psalmist, like Paul in the First Reading,
urges believers to ponder the great things GOD has done in order to bring salus
– healing, health, salvation – to all who will accept it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continues His Sermon on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mount, He enhances the teachings of Moses and raises them to
a higher plane.  Jesus calls His disciples not simply to act justly and fairly,
but to act with compassion and love.  If mistreated, instead of demanding
retribution, one should be willing to accept the mistreatment.  If challenged
to give one item, one should give not only what is requested, but more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading today’s scripture passages might lead one to wonder
about the “wisdom” or sanity of being a disciple of Jesus.  In earthly terms,
it doesn’t make sense.  In a world that finds it hard to even treat others</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>justly or fairly, we are being urged to go the next step and
give more than what justice demands.  We may wonder about the reason for this. 
I believe that one of the key words in the readings today is that of diakonos –
servant-minister (used in one form or another in verses 3 and 4 of the First
Reading).  Each of us is called to be a servant or minister – to serve others. 
Servanthood is much different than slavery.  Slavery is a forced doing for
others.  One does not have a choice as a slave.  We are asked to freely choose
to give to others above and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>beyond the call of duty or equity.  We, like Jesus (and like
His servant Paul), are being challenged to do whatever</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is necessary so that others will experience the GOoD News of
salvation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The paradoxical part of this concept of servanthood-ministry
is that in being willing to give totally of ourselves, we will be given more
than we could ever imagine.  We may suffer, and even die, in the service of
others, but we will live eternally.  We may have to deprive ourselves of some
of our wealth, but we be enriched beyond expectations.   We may experience a
certain amount of personal bad news, but we will be heirs of the everlasting
GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yesterday (June 15) was Father’s Day in the United States. 
Many fathers expected to be treated as “king for a day.”  Yet, I remember one
Father’s Day, when one father who was willing to give up at least part of his
day to go to a friend’s house and repair the friend’s kitchen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faucet.  He realized a friend’s need surpassed his own
“right” to be served on his “day.”  He was able to spend some time with one of
his children, who assisted in the repair of the kitchen faucet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am sure that there are many examples of servanthood in
your life experiences.  You probably have benefitted from others who have had a
servant mentality and were willing to do something for you, so that your life
would be easier and more manageable.  There are times, also, when you have
demonstrated the servant role in dealing with family members, friends, or even
happenstance acquaintances.  When you have been either the recipient or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the giver of acts of service, you probably sensed the joy,
the peace, the patience, the power of the Holy Spirit that Paul mentions in his
letter today.  And that joyful experience of servanthood-ministry is only a
foretaste of the blessings GOD has prepared for us in the fullness of the Reign
of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, being a disciple of the Master-Teacher is challenging,
difficult, and sometimes unpleasant.  Yet, the Lord Jesus promises that we will
experience the GOoD News of salvation not because we have done those acts of
service, but because GOD is loving and kind.  It is because we know of the
loving kindness, the acts of Servanthood-Ministry that GOD has done for us,
especially in and through Jesus, that we have the strength and ability to serve
others and minister to them.  It is because we have experienced the wondrous deeds
of GOD that we can go out and extend those same sorts of GOoD deeds to
others.   In that spirit, let us join the psalmist today and say, “All the ends
of the earth have seen the salvation by our GOD.  Sing joyfully to the LORD,
all you lands; break into song; sing praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How have I
experienced someone else being a servant/minister to me? When I have been the
beneficiary of the loving service of another, how have I felt? What does it
mean to me to be a servant-minister? Who might benefit from my being of loving
service today? What can I do to go beyond mere justice and equity to
unconditional compassion and love for others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, ever loving and compassionate. 
Through Your GOoDness, Your great love has led to wondrous deeds.  You did not
need to create us and gift us, but as a sign of Your continued, unconditional
love, Your Son chose to give of Himself.  As we ponder the divine acts of
service to us, we are moved to thanksgiving and gratitude.  As we reflect on
Jesus’ service-ministry of salvation, You have once again revealed Your
graciousness.  Jesus asks us to do more than just express our appreciation for
gift of salvation</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that You have given us.  He has called us, His disciples, to
do as He, the Master-Teacher, has done.  Jesus invites us to share in His
servanthood-ministry.  We thank You also for giving us examples of those who
have answered Jesus’ call, such as St. Paul.  May we respond fully to the
invitation and be willing to give of ourselves in serving others, so that they
too might experience Your gift of GOoD News.  And may we always lift up our
song of praise together with Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and
Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Joseph Cafasso:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-joseph-cafasso</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 8: 1-9;       Psalm 146: 2, 5-6ab,
6c-7, 8-9a;        Matthew 5: 43-48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings encourage us to incorporate GOD’s attributes
into our lives.  St. Paul urges the Corinthians to be gracious (root word in
Greek - χαρις – charis) just as Jesus performed a gracious act and gave up His
wealth (His position in heaven) and became poor (by lowering Himself to be an
earthly human), so that we might be enriched.  Some of the magnanimous
qualities of GOD are listed in the psalm.  In the Gospel, Jesus exhorts His
disciples to be “perfect” as His Abba-Father is perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul address the people of Corinth, inviting them to
give</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>graciously to those who are in need within the universal
(“catholic”) fellowship of believers.  He gives them the example of the
Macedonians (churches in Neopolis [today’s Kavala], Thessalonika [today’s
Thessaloniki], and Philippi - to name just a few) who generously donated to the
needs of others.  Paul, as typical of his writings, uses a play on words with
the Greek root word charis. Different forms of this word can be translated into
English as “thanks,” “grace,” “graciousness,” “gracious acts,” “gifts,” and
“thanksgiving” (eu-charistia).  Because they have benefitted from the graces
given by GOD, the Corinthians (and all believers) are to act graciously in
giving to the collection Paul is taking up to be sent to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the mother church (assembly) in Jerusalem.  Paul describes
the gracious act of Jesus, Who gave up the richness of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>being in heaven at the right hand of His Abba-Father.  Jesus
became poor by limiting Himself to our human nature, so that those who believed
in Him might be enriched by sharing in the fullness of the heavenly inheritance
that Jesus was graciously extending to them.  If GOD has so graciously and
generously done that for believers, then they must show a similar act of
kindness and give thankful graciousness to others.  I am reminded of what one
pastor says:  “We must not just give to a need, we must give because we have a
need to give.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist lifts up a hymn of gratitude and thanksgiving
to GOD in response to the way GOD has treated mortals.  Some of the gracious
acts of GOD are described:  making heaven and earth, securing justice for the
oppressed, giving food to the hungry, setting captives free, giving sight to
the blind, raising the lowly, loving the just, and protecting strangers. 
Because GOD has performed such charitable and loving acts for us, we must give
thanks (eu- charistein) to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His Sermon on the Mount, raising the practice of His
disciples to a higher level than what was required of the followers of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mosaic tradition.  Not only must we love our neighbors (fellow
believers), but also we must love our persecutors, for that is required of the
children of a gracious Abba.  We are called to be perfectly (unconditionally)
loving as GOD was in the sending of the Son and in allowing the Son to be
persecuted and killed as a sign of GOD’s graciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that the standards
to which</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are being held are quite high.  We are being asked to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“perfect” as GOD is “perfect.”  That is an impossible task
for us as mere humans.  How can we be perfect?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people of Islam have as part of the philosophy/belief,
that humans can never be perfect, for only GOD is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>perfect.  So, intentionally in every work of art, they
create an imperfection.  Every Islamic masterpiece has a purposeful flaw in it
so no one can say that it is perfect.  Yet, in the Gospel, Jesus commands us to
be perfect as His and our Abba is perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are we being doomed to failure since we cannot be perfect? I
don’t think so.  I believe that we are called</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>upon to reflect how perfectly gracious GOD is.  We are – to
the best of our own ability and more importantly aided by the grace of GOD – to
reflect the GOD of all charis.  We do not and cannot be perfect in and of
ourselves.  We can, however, enable people to experience a taste of the
perfectly gracious GOD that we have come to know.  GOD will fill our
imperfections with GOD’s own perfection.  People will have the opportunity to
experience the perfection of a loving GOD even in the imperfect, yet genuine,
way we treat them.  GOD will supply the perfection of our reflecting GOD’s
charis (gift) and charisma (gifts).  We are to “incorporate” GOD’s
graciousness, GOD’s unconditional love.  I chose the word “incorporate” that
means we are to show that GOD can be “in” our “corpus” (body) and manifest the
divine attributes of graciousness through our body.  Yes, we will be imperfect
incorporation, but GOD can work through us to bring the divine perfection and
graciousness to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another important aspect of our reflecting and incorporating
GOD’s perfection is that we need to be sure to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>direct the praise, thanksgiving (eu-charistia) to the
Perfect One.  People must know that it is GOD Who is perfect, and gracious, and
worthy of thanks.  If we strive to bring GOD’s perfect charis to others, they
will be blessed by the perfection of GOD and will be able to join the psalmist
today in singing GOD’s praise:  “Praise the LORD, my soul!  I will praise the
LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my GOD while I live.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The  personal  question/action  for today:      How have  I 
experienced  the  perfect graciousness of GOD?  Which individuals in my life
have reflected GOD’s graciousness and allowed me to sense the perfect and
unconditional love of GOD?  How can I better incorporate GOD’s graces into my
life and mirror (although imperfectly) the perfect love that GOD has for
others?  Who might be most in need of experiencing GOD’s perfect graces through
my caring for them today and/or this week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever gracious, perfect in extending
Your graces to us.  Through Your GOoDness, we can praise You and give You
thanks for all that You have done for us individually and collectively.  So
often we have failed to reflect and incorporate Your perfect gifting to us.  We
have not fully appreciated Your gracious acts.  We have failed to give thanks
to You.  Yet, You have not ceased to continue to pour out Your perfect graces
upon us, especially in and through the life and ministry of Your Son, Jesus. 
He was, and is, the perfect reflection – the perfect incorporation, the perfect
incarnation – of Your graciousness. As He reached out His loving and caring
hands to others, He called them to a higher level of behavior, not just loving
those who have loved or could love us, but also loving those who are graceless
in their treatment of us. His death and resurrection were the perfect
reflection of Your graciousness as He laid down His life in perfect obedience
to You, His loving Abba.  Through the guidance of Your Holy Spirit, help us to
reflect and incorporate Your perfect graciousness, and we ask You to fill in
the imperfections of our reflection, so that all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>peoples – friends and enemies – might experience Your
perfect love.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Son and the Perfect Reflection and Incorporation of
You.  He is our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Venerable Matt Talbot:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/venerable-matt-talbot</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 9: 6-11;      Psalm 112: 1bc-2, 3-4,
9;       Matthew 6: 1-6, 16-18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD will not be outdone in generosity.  This thought runs
through the readings today.  St. Paul urges the Corinthians to give abundantly
to those who are in need and to do so cheerfully.  The psalm speaks of the way
GOD lavishly gives to those who are kind and merciful.  In the Gospel, Jesus
urges His disciples to give alms, pray, and fast in a way that does not call
attention to themselves and their acts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading today, St. Paul continues to exhort the
faithful in Corinth to be gracious in their care of the less fortunate.  Not
only are they to give, but they are to give abundantly and with a joyful
heart.  Giving should not be the result of an obligation.  It should flow from
having been graced with so much from a gracious GOD.  Giving is not the cause
of GOD’s favor, but GOD’s favor should be the stimulus to giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is always the author of all GOoD.  “Being GOoD” is not
to win GOD’s blessings.  Rather because GOD is kind and merciful and people
have experienced the magnanimity of GOD, they should want to share what they
have been given.  This should be done with the same joy GOD manifests in divine
giving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm praises the individual who is gracious, kind, and
merciful. Blessedness – being one with the Blessed One – means manifesting
GOD’s love to others.  Being generous begins a cycle, a virtuous cycle (as
opposed to a vicious cycle) in which the more one gives in response to having
been gifted by GOD, the more GOD gifts the human giver.  It is the ultimate
example of “what comes around, goes around.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is the passage heard on Ash Wednesday.  Jesus
once again reminds His disciples that three marks (signs) of His followers are
almsgiving, praying, and fasting.  These three disciplines (practices of a
disciple) are not limited to the penitential season of Lent, but they should be
the regular training and practice of Jesus’ disciples at all times.  Not only
are the three activities important, but the spirit and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mode of implementing them are also important.  One should
perform these disciplines, not so that others will see the person performing
them, but because they are fitting responses to a relationship with the GOD who
sees and knows all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I think about great athletes
or truly outstanding entertainers.  The amount of work, practice, and training
that is involved in becoming a star is not usually seen.  Yet the truly
magnificent performers don’t just perform. They spend hours going over their
routine until they are able to act gracefully with seemingly no effort.  Yes,
it is true that some individuals are given talents naturally, but it still
takes practice and a great amount of repetitive work to develop their art into
graceful presentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the most remarkable individuals, such as the late</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>actor, Gregory Peck, were aware that their talents were
gifts from GOD.  Yes, they put a lot of work into perfecting their talents. 
The truly great individuals, however, are the most gracious in caring for
others and inspiring others.  Again, this flows from their awareness of having
been graced by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What this means to me is three-fold:  1) I must realize the
gifts and abilities GOD has given me; 2) I must enhance those gifts by my
repeated training and discipline; 3) I must use those gifts, not just for my
own benefit, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but for the benefit of others, helping individuals, and
bringing them the GOoD News that GOD has gifted them also.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being able to ascertain one’s gifts, talents, and abilities
is an act of a humble person.  A truly humble person is honest about the
particular skills and abilities one has.  At the same time, the sincerely
honest person realizes that his/her talents are gifts from GOD, the ultimate
Gift Giver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most skills, even those innate ones, must be honed and
refined through practice.  It takes time and effort to enhance one’s abilities
to the point of being able to act gracefully and graciously.  Training involves
the whole person – physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.  The spiritual
part demands that we turn to the Giver of all Gifts and seek divine guidance in
knowing when and how and with whom to use the gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1 Corinthians 12: 7, St. Paul reminds us that gifts
(charismata – talents, abilities, skills) are given for the common GOoD.  We
are gifted not so much that we can gain personal fame, wealth, or prestige, but
that we can edify and build up others.  Part of the responsibility of being
gifted is that we pass on the gifts (or the result of the gifts) we have been
given, so that others can benefit from them also.  If everyone had this
attitude there would be no despots, tyrants, or dictators.  There also would be
a greater sense of community and communal sharing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus promised that if we use a generous measure in giving
to others because GOD has gifted us in the first place, then GOD will use an
even more generous measure to give back to us.  Talk about big dividends and
exponential returns!  GOD will not be outdone in generosity.  I am reminded of
Luke 6: 38 (“Give, and it will be given to you.  A good measure, pressed down,
shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the
measure you use, it will be measured to you”).  The imagery is that if we use a
large measuring cup in giving to others, GOD will use an even larger measuring
container, so much so that not only our containers will be packed tightly with
the gifts, but even the folds of our clothes will be inundated with the
gracious gifts of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The result of our awareness of the gifts we have received,
our disciplined training, and our sharing with others is that we and others
will be aware of the abundance graciousness of our GOD Who will not be outdone
in gift giving.  Then today’s words of Paul will ring true:  “You are being
enriched in every way for all generosity, that, through us, produces
thanksgiving to GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What are some
examples of GOD’s graciousness to me?  What are the special
gifts/talents/abilities I have received from GOD? How have a honed those gifts
GOD has given me by practicing those gifts, through discipline and repeated
use?  How have I been able to enrich the lives of others through the gifts GOD
has given to me? How can I be more conscious of giving thanks to GOD for GOD’s
generosity and graciousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever gracious.  Through Your
GOoDness, You will not be outdone in graciousness.  You continually gift
humanity with Your gifts.  You want us to not only enjoy Your kindness, but to
share it with others so that they, too, can be blessed.  It is in our
acknowledgment of Your abundant gifts and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our using them for the benefit of the whole, that we give
Your thanks and praise.  Yet, too often we have failed to see You as the source
of our talents and abilities.  At other times we have failed to develop the
skills and gifts You have given us because that would take too much of our time
and effort.  Sometimes we have failed to share the benefits of Your gifting
with others and tried to hoard the gifts.  For the times we have failed to
respond to Your graciousness, we seek Your pardon and peace.  Through the
guidance of Your Holy Spirit, help us to look to our Master-Teacher, Jesus,
Your Son.  And through our proper use of the blessings that You have given us,
may we work together for the edification and building up of Your Reign here on
earth in anticipation of the fullness of that Reign in heaven.  We lift this
prayer of praise and thanksgiving to You in and through Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, the Master-Teacher Who has given us the example to follow, and Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 11: 1-11;                Psalm 111:
1b-2, 3-4, 7-8;                 Matthew 6: 7-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The life of a disciple can be challenging.  Being a follower
of Jesus is much more than intellectual mouthing of some tenets of belief.  In
the First Reading, St. Paul expresses his strong feelings dealing with his
ministry to the Corinthians.  In the Gospel, Jesus exhorts His disciples to be
devoted to prayer and to forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his Second Letter to the Corinthians, St. Paul expresses
why he is concerned for the people of Corinth (where he lived for about 1.5
years).  He has invested a great deal of time and effort in ministering to them
so that they could be in relationship with the Lord Jesus.  He, as a loving
father of a bride, has given his beloved</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>offspring (the members of the Corinthian Christian
Community) into the hands of Christ, the Bridegroom.  A parent does all he can
to provide a joyful and peaceful life for his/her child, even if that means
handing over the child to another and thus lessening (at least in time) the
close relationship that one has with the child.  Paul has labored for his
beloved Corinthians, supporting himself and his ministry to them by means of
the generosity of other Pauline communities, particularly in Macedonia
(Philippi, Berea, Thessalonika, etc.).  Paul also defends the authenticity of
his proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus.  He has been true to the teachings of
the Lord Jesus and has not made himself superior to the Lord Jesus, as some
other so called “super-apostles” have.  Paul has been motivated by the love he
has for the Corinthians because He knows GOD loves them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist proclaims that the only fitting response to all
the wondrous and loving deeds of GOD is to praise the name of the LORD in the
assembly of the just.  Once one has experienced the GOoDness of GOD, one is
motivated to share that GOoDness with others so they, too, can experience GOD’s
magnificence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel [which is the ‘meat’ in the sandwich of the
two pieces of bread read yesterday], Jesus emphasizes the importance of prayer
and forgiveness. As He shares the “Model Prayer” [also known as the “Our
Father” or “the Lord’s Prayer”], Jesus links prayer and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness.  As His disciples are shown</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how to call upon Jesus’ Abba-Father as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their own Abba, Jesus portrays the link that exists between
them and His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First comes three affirmations of Who GOD is:  1) the One
Whose Name is holy; 2) the One Whose Reign is to be acknowledged, 3) the One
Whose will/plan on earth should be done just as it is in heaven.  Next, comes
three requests that flow from the relationship with GOD as Abba: 1) the daily
providence of what is necessary, 2) forgiveness, and 3) deliverance from evil. 
Expanding upon the role of forgiveness in the life of the disciples (including
us), Jesus states that there is a condition of our being forgiven by GOD. 
GOD’s forgiveness is to be linked to our forgiveness of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a disciple of the Lord Jesus can be quite
overwhelming.  It means that we are called, as Paul emphasizes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in his letter, to be servants-ministers.  We are not to be
burdensome to those whom we serve, but we should go out of our way so that they
can experience the holiness, the Reign, the will of GOD.  We are to do what we
can to show that GOD meets the daily needs (note:  “needs” not “wants”) of
GOD’s children.  We are to extend the same forgiveness to those who wrong us as
we know GOD extends to us.  We are to help others avoid the evil that is in the
world by our bringing GOoDness to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember what happened to me a few years ago at this time
of year.  I had to repeatedly remind myself that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am called to be a servant to others.  After processing all
the middle school report cards and transcripts (by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:00 am since I got to work about 4:00 am), I embarked on
my ministry to the friend who was still hospitalized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That included going to the friend’s bank and handling
financial affairs, going to the friend’s house to check on things at the
deserted house and checking in with neighbors.  I also went to the post office
and picked up mail before going to the hospital to deliver mail, requested
items, and spend time visiting the recuperating</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>patient-friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I figured the rest of the afternoon would be busy, but I
would probably be able to relax a little in the evening. When I arrived home, I
started to install a new kitchen faucet.  As I was working on that, the auto
repair shop called and said the car was ready.  So, I drove a family member to
pick up the car.  When I returned, I finished installing the faucet.  I wanted
to finish that before the others came to the house.  I also started sprucing up
the house because we would be having company soon (as it turned out sooner than
I expected).  After being down on my hands and knees to wash the kitchen floor,
I vacuumed most of the rest of the house.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after the others returned, we took a different car
into the repair shop.  Upon returning, a little more cleaning.  I also spent
time debugging a computer problem that someone was having with a program she
was using.  As the evening of cleaning was starting to turn into night, another
family member called from his cell</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>phone to announce that the vehicle he was driving would not
stay in gear.  After directing him what to do, and his informing me that he was
having a gathering of his friends at our house, I awaited the arrival of his
friends – the unexpected company I referred to above.  I spent time listening
to the first arriving guest describe his experiences in Europe for the last six
months.  When the family member called to say that he was at the transmission
shop, I left the house and drove to repair facility where the tow truck had
hauled the transmission-less vehicle.  I returned home, the house full of young
adults.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is the point of the saga, you may ask.  Simply, I
sensed that the Lord Jesus wanted me to be of service to many people that day
and I was particularly asked to do so in a manner that would enable others to
know that GOD is a loving GOD Who takes care of us and provides for us.  It was
a challenge to reflect a positive attitude and not loose my patience (which I
did for a couple of moments during the day, especially while working on the
faucet).  I had to remind myself that if others were to know that GOD is a
loving Abba, I must be loving also.  I also had to be forgiving of those who
were not gracious to me.  It gave me food for thought on how loving, kind,
gracious, and forgiving GOD is when all of us expect so much from the Lord
Jesus and His Abba.  I recalled the Lord Jesus is there as the One Who came to
serve and not be served.  How truly grateful I am that Jesus has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>given me yet another glimpse of His Abba and how I am called
to reflect GOD’s love to others!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: In what ways has the
Lord Jesus demonstrated that I must be willing to pay the cost of being a
disciple?  When I sense the needs of others, how do I respond?  Do I extend my
service cheerfully and patiently?  How do I reflect the graciousness,
forgiveness, and loving quality of the Abba, Who happens to be GOD? When I pray
“The Lord’s Prayer” how conscious am I of sanctifying GOD’s name; desiring
GOD’s Reign be done; and seeking to do GOD’s will in my earthly existence? Do I
see how GOD is providing daily bread for me, extending divine forgiveness to
me, and leading me away from evil?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and forgiving
Abba-Father.  Through Your Divine GOoDness, Your Son has allowed us to call You
“our Abba.”  Thank You for demonstrating the holiness of You and Your name, by
giving us experiences of how loving You are.  We seek Your Reign over us, and
we desire to do Your will.  Each day You provide what we need physically,
spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually.  Yet, we sometimes miss Your
self-revelation in the events of our lives and in the message in Your Word.  We
seek Your forgiveness, realizing that we must also be forgiving of others. 
Guide us along the Way that leads us through the dark valley of evil.  Help us
keep our eyes on the Light Who shines upon the path we are to follow.  May we
continue to give You glory and praise in the assembly of our family, friends,
acquaintances, and even our enemies.  We make this prayer in the name of Your
Son, Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 11: 18, 21-30;       Psalm 34: 2-3,
4-5, 6-7;       Matthew 6: 19-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life on earth, especially as lived by a disciple of Jesus,
is not always easy.  In the First Reading, St. Paul describes what he has
endured for the sake of spreading the Gospel.  The psalm is a reminder that GOD
understands, knows, and rescues those who are going through difficult times,
especially those whose hearts in the right place.  In the Gospel, Jesus
comments on what is truly valuable in life and how our actions and attitudes
are affected by what we consider valuable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In writing to the Corinthians, St. Paul wants them to know
the reasons why he has labored so hard and suffered so much.  It is because he
wants the people to whom he ministers to know how valuable he considers their
acceptance of the GOoD News of salvation.  He boasts of the trials and
tribulations he has experienced on behalf of sharing the faith with them and
the other Christians with whom he has shared the GOoD News.  The struggles,
through which he has suffered, are gladly accepted if they benefit others and
enable them to draw closer to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist remarks that GOD is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aware of the sufferings of the holy people.  GOD hears the
cry of those who call upon the LORD and GOD answers their prayers with salus –
healing, salvation, and restoration to fullness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus remarks that where our heart is, there
will our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>treasure be.  If we seek to amass merely earthly
possessions, we will eventually be disappointed, for the material things will
reach their expiration and will not accompany us on our finally journey across
the transitional door known as death.  On the other hand, if we look to a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heavenly treasure house, we will be able to experience the
wealth of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings make me look at what I find valuable.  It is so
easy to be influenced by the lure and advertisement of the world.  The world
urges us to seek great wealth, beauty, and fame, even at the cost of
relationship with family, friends, (and GOD).  GOD asks us what we are willing
to sacrifice (“make holy”) in order to experience the everlasting relationship
with GOD and all that that relationship entails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul, obviously, is willing to risk everything including
his health, welfare, and wealth.  He treasures a relationship with GOD so
highly that he will endure suffering, pain, and persecution.  And he is willing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to do this not only for his own personal relationship with
GOD, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>also for the sake of others and their relationship with
GOD.  Paul wants all those to whom he ministers to experience the blessings of
GOD.  He knows that, like his Master-Teacher, he must bring the message of
GOD’s salvation to others even at great personal expense (financially,
physically, and emotionally).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on my life, I know that I do not always have my
heart in the right place.  I sometimes seek personal gratification in place of
proclaiming the GOoD News to others.  I sometimes become too attached to items
rather than promoting a relationship with others for the sake of spreading the
Gospel.  I realize that it is okay to enjoy things, but if they prevent me from
ministering to others, then I should re-think my attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not promoting that we purposefully go out and get
shipwrecked, or scourged, or seek out dangers (Paul did not seek those out). 
Yet, if hardships come our way as we seek to promote the message of salvation,
so be it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel challenged by the readings today.  I need to reflect
on what I truly find valuable.  I can do that by examining on what I spend my
energy and my time.  I also realize that I must continue to develop my
relationship with the Master-Teacher Who gives an example of caring and loving
others in response to the relationship He has with His Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we are able to honestly say that our treasure is with
GOD, then we will be able to proclaim with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>psalmist today and say:  “I will bless the LORD at all
times; GOD’s praise shall be ever in my mouth.  Let my soul glory in the LORD!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What do I consider
my treasure for which I am willing to do anything, no matter what the cost
might be? Do I sell myself out for things that do not have eternally lasting
value?  How do I give witness to the value of relationships with GOD and with
other people as opposed to the mere value of things?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, giver of promises of life with
You.  Through Your GOoDness, You ask us to look within ourselves to see what we
place as our number one concern and what we hold as truly valuable.  You desire
that we have our hearts rooted in You and Your gift of salvation.  Yet, being
in the world that does not value You or Your message, we are easily swayed to
follow paths that lead to destruction and decay.  Through the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit, help us focus on what is truly worth everything – a
relationship with You and Your Son.  Give us the strength to risk everything,
not only for our own acceptance of the Gospel, but also for the furthering of
its spread to others.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Brother and Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-aloysius-gonzaga</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians 12: 1-10;        Psalm 34: 8-9,
10-11, 12-13;         Matthew 6: 24-34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often we miss the message GOD would have for us because
we are focusing on the wrong issues.  St. Paul, after continual prayer and
revelation from GOD, realizes that the earthly problems and difficulties are
nothing when one considers the awesomeness that GOD has planned for those who
seek GOD.  The psalm refrain is an invitation to “taste and see” the GOoDness
that GOD has in store for those who are faithful.  In the Gospel, Jesus urges
His disciples not to be pre-occupied about earthly matters (such as food and
clothing).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s First Reading, St. Paul boasts of an individual
who has experienced a special revelation of GOD.  In the revelation, the
individual comes into the presence of GOD and tastes of the GOoDness of GOD in
a way that is indescribable and/or not permitted to be described.  Many
scripture scholars agree that Paul is the beneficiary of this manifestation of GOD. 
It has many parallels to the Near-Death Experience that many people who have
clinically died and then come back to life.  Yet the focus is not to be on the
one who has experienced this other-world phenomenon, but on the One Who has
been made it possible and was manifested through the experience.  Paul also
speaks about the fact that his worldly trials and tribulation help to keep his
feet on the ground rather than just existing with his head in the clouds with
its magnificent happenings.  Paul mentions “a thorn in the flesh.”  Some
scholars think Paul was referring to some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>individual who was a real pain in the you-know-where. 
Obviously, Paul had some really rough times with something, or more likely
someone, which or who challenged his ministry.  In the end, Paul realizes that
in his hardships and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>difficulties, GOD is being manifested even stronger, for GOD
is the real center of Paul’s ministry (thus, the center is not focusing on his
problems, his teaching, or himself).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist (continuing where yesterday’s psalm ended)
presents a proposal:  come to the LORD and experience the marvelous gifts GOD
has for those who accept the divine invitation.  Once one tastes (or tries out)
the specialness of GOD, one moves on to a new plane in which GOD becomes the
focus of one’s life.  Being one with GOD brings divine prosperity which is
beyond any expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues the theme introduced
yesterday</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>concerning a person’s heart and the treasure that they
seek.  He tells His disciples that they cannot have more than one thing/person
at the center of their lives.  If mammon (money, wealth, possessions) takes the
focus of one’s intentions, then there is no room for GOD to sit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the throne of one’s existence.  Even focusing only on
one’s physical appearance or having one’s needs met can de-throne GOD from the
center of one’s life.  If too much energy is spent on worrying, then there is
not enough time to spend in being – being in relationship with GOD and with
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, I feel challenged by the readings.  I sense that
I am being asked to re-evaluate my priorities. Sometimes I become overly
concerned about my hurt feelings or about financial matters.  In doing so, I
miss the special ways that GOD wishes me to be in relationship with the Trinity
and with my fellow travelers on the journey of faith. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A while ago, I went through a real period of
self-assessment.  I had to face some of the aspects of my relationship with
some other people.  I realized that what I had been doing was wallowing in
self-pity because someone had not understood what I was going through.  I had
internalized an event as a rejection of me and my worth.  I had focused on my
own hurt rather than trying to see if GOD was trying to give me a message or
relieve me of some pressure.  I had totally missed where the focus of some
circumstances should have been.  Instead, I thought only of myself and my hurt
pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also remember a time not so long ago when I became overly
pre-occupied with financial concerns.  Instead of realizing, as Jesus points
out in today’s Gospel, that I am more valuable to GOD than the beautiful
flowers of the field or the marvelous birds of the sky.  I had been worried
about how things were going to work out in some economic issues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One more example may also help.  I remember talking with a
friend who is about the same age as myself.  He was talking about his future
plans of being able to retire.  I realized that some people are more concerned
about what the future has in store than living in the moment, meeting others’
needs right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not saying that I should not be conscious of my
feelings or what may be ahead of me in the years to come.  I am also not
suggesting that I do not have to take financial responsibilities for myself and
my loved ones. What I am saying is that I need to put it all in perspective –
GOD’s perspective.  I was emphasizing too much on the thorns in my flesh and
emptiness in my pocketbook and what the unpredictable earthly future will be
and not allowing myself to taste the GOoDness of the LORD right here and right
now.  The lesson that is being hammered home to me is that I need to be aware
of, and responsible for, the events in my life, but that I cannot let the
negatives aspects of life consume me.  Instead of being consumed and devoured
by worries and problems, I need to taste and see the GOoDness of GOD.  When I
come into GOD’s presence and shine the spotlight on the Lord Jesus being with
me, then I can realize that GOD is looking out for me and cares for me more
than I can ever imagine.  It is then that I should be able to quote the words
of the psalmist today and say:  “Fear (being in awe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of) the LORD, you GOD’s holy ones, for nought is lacking to
those who fear the LORD.  The great grow poor and hungry; but those who seek
the LORD want for no GOoD thing.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What are my biggest
worries and concerns? How do these issues relate to my relationship with GOD
and my relationship with others? Who or what sits on the throne of my being? 
Am I the center of my attention?  How can I manifest the Lord Jesus’ concern
for me and taste more fully of GOD’s GOoDness? What can I do to help relieve
the undue anxiety in someone’s life this coming week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever caring and always loving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You desire the very best for us.  Yet at times we settle
for less than the very best and focus all our attentions on second-rate things.
For the times we have wasted our time and energy worrying about things that
were not of importance in the long term (eternal) plan, we seek Your pardon and
peace.  May we focus on the life of Your Son, Jesus, our Master- Teacher, Who
tells us not to devote inordinate amount of concern on mundane things.  With
the guidance of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Holy Spirit, helps us to put You and Your Son in the
center of the throne of our lives.  And give us the strength, after we have
spent the proper amount of energy on earthly matters of concern, that we may
lift up our problems to You, knowing that You will take care of us with more
love and attention than You do with the birds of the sky or the flowers of the
field.  We give You glory, praise, and thanks for touching our lives and
helping</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us to put things in perspective – Your perspective.  We make
this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Genesis 14: 18-20;     Psalm 110: 1, 2, 3,
4;       1 Corinthians 11: 23-26;      Luke 9: 11b-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On this day, we celebrate the Lord Jesus’ giving of His Body
and Blood to us, in reality, by His freely chosen death and resurrection, and
sacramentally in the Eucharist. Years ago, this solemnity was called by its
Latin name Corpus Christi – “Body of Christ.” Our readings remind us today that
newer name for this celebration is the Body and Blood of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings give very different insights into the
celebration of the Body and Blood of Christ. The First Reading describes the
gifts of Melchizedek, the priest-king of Salem (Shalom - peace). The gifts were
bread and wine. The Responsorial Psalm describes David’s Lord (his descendant
who will be more important than David himself) who will be both king and
priest. The passage from 1 Corinthians is the first written account of the
celebration of the first Eucharist at the Last Supper and its application to
the regular worship service of the early Christians. The Gospel is the pericope
of one of Jesus’ multiplications of loaves in order to feed the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Melchizedek was one of the kings during the time of Abraham.
He was King of Salem (king of Shalom/peace). Not only was he a king, but he
also was a priest. Nothing is known of his origins or his history in the Old
Testament other than the verses in Genesis. He offers Abraham, the chosen one
of GOD, bread and wine. In turn, Abraham gives him a tithe (10%) of his
possessions. Melchizedek is seen as a prefigurement of Jesus in many ways.
Jesus is truly the King of Shalom/Peace, since He has come to re-establish the
peace-relationship between GOD and us, the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is the priest, king, and prophet par excellence. Jesus
takes the gifts of bread and wine, transforms them into His own Body and Blood,
and gives them to us as our food. Jesus, like Melchizedek, has origins and
history that are beyond the normal scope of knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm is the prayer of David. In this
prayer, David hears</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the LORD GOD call upon one of the descendants of David and
call him “Lord.” This person will be like Melchizedek of old – priest and king
– and will rule as King of Jerusalem and more. This descendant of David will be
able to be called not only descendant of David, but also the begotten one of
GOD. It is no</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wonder that this psalm is applied to Jesus, the King of
Peace, and only begotten</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Son of GOD, Who is the King and the Priest (and the
Prophet).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s Second Reading from St. Paul’s First Letter to the
Corinthians was written less than 30 years after the death and resurrection of
Jesus (circa 57 AD). It is the first written account that exists of what took
place at the Last Supper and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what continues to be the core of the Eucharistic celebration
of Paul’s day, and ours, too. Paul begins by saying that he is handing down
(traditio) what has been handed down to him by Jesus. That tradition was what
Jesus did at the Last Supper, on the night before He died. Paul describes the
action with which we are so familiar: “that the Lord Jesus. . .took bread. .
.giving thanks, broke it and said, ‘This is My body that is for you. Do this in
remembrance of Me.’” Paul concludes this section by proclaiming, “For as often
as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord
until he comes.” It is in our sharing in this Eucharistic (“thanksgiving”)
celebration that we truly continue the proclamation of the death</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel presents one of the many accounts of Jesus
feeding the multitude by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>multiplying bread. It is seen as a foretaste of His feeding
His disciples with His own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Body and Blood. The actions of Jesus are the same as those
related by Paul in today’s Second Reading, and to the actions we use in our
Eucharistic celebrations today: Taking bread, looking up to heaven, blessing
(saying a benediction),</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>breaking, and sharing. By taking the bread Himself, Jesus is
personally involved in the action of feeding and nourishing the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people. In looking up to heaven, He shows His unity with His
heavenly Abba-Father. In blessing the bread, Jesus demonstrates His “saying
well” (Latin bene dictio) of not only the bread but also what is implied in the
bread – the feeding of the people. And finally in His giving and sharing, He
shows that He continues to bestow His gifts on others. Then Jesus </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has His disciples be a part of His action by their
distribution. [Side note about leftovers: the 12 baskets of leftovers would be
over 300 dry gallons of food.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the gift that Jesus gave us – the gift of
salvation through His giving of His Body and Blood both sacramentally and
physically on the cross – I am once again in awe at the magnificence and
perfect plan of GOD. Jesus was very much aware of the Hebrew (and other
nation’s) significance of a covenant – a relationship that binds people, often
celebrated with a meal. He also realized the power of zikaron – remembering and
re- enacting and making present again. Jesus wanted His disciples to celebrate
His saving death and to remember</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how He had brought about our salvation. Obviously, they
could not offer another perfect sacrifice, since His perfect sacrifice was a
“once and for all” sacrifice. Yet, in zikaron (remembering and re-enacting),
they were able to make present the Lord Jesus’ giving of Himself – His Body and
Blood. They were able to take up the bread and the cup and He would be present
with them again as they proclaimed His death until He comes again. They would
be able to be one with Him at His table and receive Him once again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How awesome is our GOD Who allows us to bind ourselves again
(re-ligio) by remembering and re-enacting the saving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>moments of our salvation. We renew our blood covenant – the
New Covenant in Jesus’ Blood – whenever we come together and give thanks
(eucharistein). We proclaim His death and resurrection as we await His return.
We zikaron (remember and re-member) Jesus’ gift of Himself and take Him into
our very being. The words of Jesus in John 6: 53-57 become so meaningful to me:
“Jesus said to them, ‘I tell you the truth, unless you eat the Flesh of the Son
of Man and drink His Blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats My Flesh and
drinks My Blood has eternal life, and I will raise that one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>up on the last day. For My Flesh is real food and My Blood
is real drink. Whoever eats My Flesh and drinks My Blood remains in Me, and I
in him. Just as the living Abba sent Me and I live because of the Abba, so the
one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How well do I
proclaim the death of the Lord through my participation in the Eucharistic
celebration?  Can people sense my communion (union with) with Jesus as I
receive the Bread of Life and drink from the Cup of Salvation? When I leave
church after participation in the Eucharist, do I continue to proclaim the
death and resurrection of Jesus by the way I treat others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all-knowing and full of wisdom.
Through Your GOoDness, we come into Your presence and continue to marvel at
Your awesomeness. You have always desired to be bound with people in a loving
and life-giving relationship. Throughout history, You have offered covenants to
those whom You call, binding them with sacrificial rites using blood and bread.
Yet, because the participants in these covenant relationships were merely
human, they failed to have a perfect bond. In the fullness of time, You sent
Your Son, truly divine and truly human, to make the one and perfect sacrifice –
the sacrifice of Himself. In being both the perfect priest and the perfect
victim, both human and divine, He established a new and perfect covenant with
humanity through His giving of His very self – His Body and His Blood – on the
cross of salvation. Yet desiring that His disciples be able to remember
(zikaron) Him and proclaim His death and resurrection and be united with Him,
He gave them a way. On the night before He died, while celebrating the Old
Covenant feast of Passover, He took bread and gave it to His disciples, saying,
“Take and eat; this is My Body.” And during the final cup of blessing at the
Seder supper, He passed around the cup of wine while saying, “Take and drink,
this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the cup of My Blood – the Blood of the New Covenant, to
be shed for the multitude. Do this in remembrance (zikaron) of Me.” We truly
give You thanks (eucharistein) today for Your allowing us to be united with (communio)
Jesus as we come to His table and share in His Body and Blood. We lift up this
prayer of thanksgiving (eucharistia) in the name of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Master-Teacher, Who is

<p class=MsoNormal>Monday of the Twelfth Week in Ordinary Time</p>

Genesis 12: 1-9;         Psalm 33: 12-13, 18-19, 20 and 22;        Matthew 7:
1-5</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Blessed are those who are chosen by GOD.”  That concept is
obvious in the First Reading and the Psalm. The Gospel implies a proviso: 
“Along with blessing comes responsibility.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next few weeks on weekdays, our First Reading
(except for major feasts) will be from Genesis.  Today we begin the story</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Abram (whose name will later be changed to Abraham) and
the promise of blessing that GOD extends to him.  Abram hears the LORD’s call
to leave his homeland and journey out to a new land that GOD will show him. 
GOD will not only bless Abram and his descendants, but Abram will be a source
of blessing for many other people and nations.  GOD has chosen Abram.  Abram
responds in obedience and therefore is blessed even more abundantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessings flow to others because of Abram’s response to
GOD’s blessing.  Thus, GOD makes a triple promise:  land, descendants, and source
of blessings for others as he shares what he has (his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faith) with others.  As we will hear in the days to come,
this triple promise is repeated multiple times (Genesis 12:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2-7; 13: 2-3, 15-16; 15: 5-8; 17: 4-8).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The refrain from the Responsorial is “Blessed the people the
LORD has chosen to be [GOD’s] own.”  Obvious from the psalm is the thought that
GOD has blessed the nation of Israel.  A more subtle message that can be
gleaned from the psalm is that GOD is willing to bless all nations.  Any person
or any nation who “fears” GOD will be blessed.  “Fearing” GOD means to
acknowledge Who GOD is and respond appropriately.  GOD is awesomely almighty. 
Responding to the mighty LORD includes admitting that one is dependent upon GOD
and needs GOD’s help.  GOD will bless those who faithfully call upon GOD for
help.  And that becomes a blessing to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel presents Jesus’ admonition to His followers that
they must be responsible – that is, they must be “able to respond” to the
blessing that GOD has given them.  GOD has already blessed the disciples of
Jesus.  Future blessings will depend on how they respond by extending their
blessings to others.  If they are understanding and gracious givers to others,
GOD will continue to be understanding of them and will graciously give even
more to them.  They must also be aware of their own faults and failings and be
willing to improve themselves before they can criticize the faults of others. 
With blessings comes responsibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize how gracious GOD
is.  GOD is willing to bless and gift anyone (including you and me) who turns
to the Lord Jesus.  Yet, I cannot just take GOD’s blessings and be complacent
with that.  I must respond to the blessings I have received by extending those
blessings to others.  Blessings are meant to be shared.  And when blessings are
shared – used for the GOoD of the whole or at least some of the whole – GOD
extends even more blessings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often people hoard “blessings.”  They keep the GOoD
things they have in a safe place, away from others, thinking that they have the
blessings for themselves only.  They store the blessings away, hoping to use
them someday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An analogy came to me.  It is like someone receiving a
special treat – a favorite pie, for example.  So that the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>person does not have to share it with others, the person
hides the treat, waiting for the day when he/she will be able to enjoy the
treat alone.  Because the person is never alone, the treat begins to spoil. 
Eventually when a moment comes when the person is finally alone, the treat has
become moldy and is not fit to eat.  How much better it would have been if the
treat had been shared with others so more people could have enjoyed the treat
and it would not have gone to moldy waste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is always willing to give blessings.  GOD is the GOD of
all blessings.  GOD is waiting to extend the divine gifts to people. 
Individuals must be willing to ask for GOD’s gifts.  And once the gifts are
received, they must be shared and used responsibly.  GOD is more than anxious
to give even more blessings to those who share what they have been given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How much different the world would be if people realized
that giving of gifts to be shared is how GOD acts. Yet, being caught up in the
selfish nature of human existence, people think only of themselves and refuse
to share the blessing that GOD has given them.  GOD continues to watch for
opportunities to shower divine blessings on people.  All they need do is call
upon the LORD and be willing to respond to GOD’s gifts.  Thus, the psalmist
says today:  “See, the eyes of the LORD are upon those who fear GOD, upon those
who hope for the LORD’s kindness, to deliver them from death and preserve them
in spite of famine.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    What are some of
the blessings I have received from GOD?  How have I handled these blessings? 
Have I hoarded them and used them only for my own benefit or have I been
willing to share them with others so others could benefit from the blessings
also? Am I always being responsible for what the Lord Jesus has given me?  Who
could know better GOD’s blessing by my sharing a blessing with them today? 
This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever gracious and full of
blessings, You desire to shower Your blessings upon people who call upon You. 
You desire to be for them the GOD of blessings, if they are willing to be Your
people.  You chose to bless those who seek Your blessings, and You expect those
whom You bless to use their blessings not only for their own GOoD, but also for
the GOoD of others.  Yet, we have failed to accept Your blessings and use them
as You would have us use them.  We have sometimes sought to be self-sufficient
rather than call upon You.  At other times we have received Your blessings and
selfishly stored them away until we could use them in ways that were not part
of Your plan.  We seek Your forgiveness for not being gracious receivers of
Your blessings and not fully responding to those blessings.  With the guidance
of Your Holy Spirit,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help us to seek the blessing You desire us to have and to
use them for the spread of Your GOoD News.  We make this prayer in the name of
Jesus, Your Son and Your greatest blessing for us, Who continues to bless us
through His words and ministry, His death and resurrection, and Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solemnity of the Birth of St. John the Baptist</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nativity of St. John the Baptist: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/nativity-of-saint-john-the-baptist</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 49: 1-6;     Psalm 139: 1b-3, 13-14ab,
14c-15;     Acts 13: 22-26;     Luke 1: 57-66, 80</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note:     Today we celebrate the Birth of John the Baptist. 
Within the Catholic tradition, we celebrate the birthdays of only three
persons: Jesus (December 25); Mary, His mother (September 8); and John the
Baptist (June 24).  These are the only persons who came forth from their
mother’s womb sinless (without original sin).  These are three key persons in
the history of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings speak about St. John the Baptist’s unique role of
being called from before his birth to do the will of GOD. For John that role
was as the person who was to prepare the way for the Messiah – the Christ.
Isaiah 49 is the second of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Servant of GOD passages in Isaiah. Although this passage is
usually considered to be a reference to the Messiah, it also has obvious
applications to John the Baptist and his being called from the womb of his
mother, Elizabeth. Psalm 139 also speaks of GOD having “formed my inmost being”
and having “knit me in my mother’s womb.” The passage from Acts reminds us of
John’s role as herald of the coming of Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and his baptizing as a sign of repentance. The Gospel gives
us the account of the birth of John the Baptist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Isaiah 49, the Servant of the LORD realizes the unique
position he has, having been called from before his birth and given a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>special name by GOD. Before John was conceived in the womb
of Elizabeth, his father, Zechariah, was told of GOD’s plan that the elderly,
childless couple</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would have a son whom they were to name John, (Hebrew,
Yochanan meaning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“the LORD is gracious”) (cf. Luke 1: 10ff). Like the
suffering servant in Isaiah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49, John was to be a servant through whom GOD would reveal
divine glory. John would also be able to identify with the words of Isaiah 49:
“Though I thought I had toiled in vain, and for nothing, uselessly, spent my
strength, my reward is with the LORD.” As John the Baptist ended his ministry
by being thrown in jail by King Herod, he sent some of his disciples to Jesus
to ask, “Are You [, Jesus,] the One Who is to come, or should we look for
another?” (Luke 7:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18-20). John ultimately was made glorious in the sight of
GOD and raised to high position, just as the servant in Isaiah 49. Jesus spoke
highly of John saying: “I tell you, among those born of women, there is not one
greater than John; yet the least in the Reign of GOD is greater than he”
(Matthew 11: 11). [I will discuss</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the last part of the verse below.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm 139 (one of my favorite psalms) echoes some of the
same themes as Isaiah 49, particularly the calling of the author from the womb
of his mother. It speaks about GOD’s knowledge of, and design for, the person.
John was truly known by GOD and designed for the unique position of being the
forerunner (precursor) of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sermon by St. Paul (in the reading from Acts) speaks of
the privileged position of John the Baptist as the herald of the coming of the
Messiah – Jesus the Christ. It also emphasizes the recognition by John of his
subservient role to Jesus (“Behold, one is coming after me; I am not worthy to
unfasten the sandals of His feet”). John prepared the people by challenging
them to repent before the Messiah came. And when the Messiah/Christ (Jesus)
came, John</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pointed Him out and took a back-seat role (cf. John 3: 30:
“He [Jesus the Messiah] must become greater, I [John] must become less”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today relates the birth and naming of John the
Baptist. It was truly a joyous time as the elderly Elizabeth gave birth. At the
naming of the infant, the relatives think the boy should be called after his
father (Zechariah) or another family member. Elizabeth, however, (being true to
the announcement from the angel)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>declares his name is to be John. When they communicate with
the muted Zechariah, he writes, “His name is John.” As</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zechariah makes known his message, his tongue, which was
muted for disbelief nine months before, is set free and he </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>proclaims his prayer of praise, the Benedictus (“Blessed be
the LORD, the GOD of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israel. . .and you, my child [John] will be called a prophet
of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare the way of the
Lord, to give GOD’s people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness
of their sins. . .” Luke 1: 67-79 [omitted from today’s Gospel]). The Gospel
ends by saying that John grew and became strong in the Spirit and lived in the
desert until he began his public ministry to Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John’s calling began before his conception in the womb of
Elizabeth. The angel Gabriel announced his birth to his father, the old priest,
Zechariah (Zachary). He was given the name of John. Biblical naming signified
special calling. He was to be “the graciousness of GOD,” because he would
announce GOD’s graciousness in the coming of the Messiah – Jesus. When Mary
(pregnant with Jesus) visited her cousin Elizabeth at the beginning of
Elizabeth’s third trimester, John leapt for joy within Elizabeth’s womb. The
Church has taught that this event caused John to be set free from original sin,
and thus be able to be born sinless. Jesus brought salvation to his cousin
while both were still in utero.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does all this mean for us? First of all, each and every
one of us has been called</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by GOD from before our birth. We may not have had an angel
announcing our birth to our parents as John’s parents had. Yet, we are called
to life by GOD and given a role to play in GOD’s plan. Unlike John, we are not
the greatest person born of woman. Yet, we can be part of those who are greater
than he was before he achieved his final place in the Reign of GOD. We are
called to be a part, even if it is the least part, of the Reign of GOD, if we
work at the mission that GOD has for us – preparing for the way of the Lord
Jesus’ coming to ourselves and to others. John achieved his place in the Reign
of GOD by living, and ultimately dying, for the Lord Jesus. That is our destiny
also, if we help others come to know the Messiah, the Lord Jesus, the Christ.
As we draw closer to our Master-Teacher and bring others to Him also, we will
be able to say with John the Baptist: “Jesus must increase in the lives of
people, while we decrease in importance and value.” Our value (as John’s value)
comes only from Jesus and our relationship with Him. Let us realize our calling
to be servants of the Lord Jesus, announcing forgiveness of sins, pointing to the
Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I see my
role as a herald of the GOoD News of Jesus? What thoughts and feelings do I
have when I realize that I have been called by GOD from before my birth? What
can I do to remind others of the “graciousness of GOD” (Yochanan/John)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever inviting. Through Your
GOoDness, You called Your servant John the Baptist from before his birth to be
the herald of Your Son, Jesus. He was willing to devote his life to helping
others prepare to receive the Messiah. He proclaimed the need for people to
reform their lives in order to follow the Christ (Messiah) when He came. We
thank You for the example and ministry of John the Baptist. You have chosen us,
also from before our birth, to share in the important mission of preparing
others for the coming of Jesus into their lives. We are privileged to be called
to this special role. We know that like John the Baptist, we, in and of
ourselves, are unworthy to have any relationship with Jesus, but because of
Your divine graciousness (Yochanan – GOD is Gracious), we can serve our sisters
and brothers and help to lead them to Jesus. Through the gifts of Your Holy
Spirit, continue to remind us of our need for repentance and strengthen us to be
heralds of the GOoD News of Jesus the Messiah. We make this prayer in the name
of Your Son, Yeshua-Jesus (“GOD Saves”), Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Jutta of Thuringia:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-jutta-of-thuringia/
Readings:  Genesis 15: 1-12, 17-18;         Psalm 105: 1-2, 3-4, 6-7,
8-9;        Matthew 7: 15-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes we don’t see the full and immediate effects of our
faith relationship with GOD.  It often takes time.  If we have patience, GOD
will fulfill all the promises made to us and will give us more than we could
ever imagine.  The First Reading is an account of the covenant (relationship)
made by GOD with Abram.  The psalm reminds us that GOD never forgets the
covenant relationship that GOD has made.  Jesus, in the Gospel, urges His
disciples to bear the GOoD fruit that is the result of being in relationship
with Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Genesis presents GOD making (literally “cutting”) a covenant
with Abram (Abraham) in few different chapters.  The covenant is basically the
same: because of Abram’s acceptance of GOD’s promised inheritance, GOD will
bless Abram and his descendants, and they will be become a great nation
possessing the promised land, and Abram and his offsprings will be the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>source of blessing for others.  Today’s account of the
relationship-covenant portrays the ritual of “cutting” or splitting animals in
two.  One or both of the two parties (in this case GOD and Abram) move between
the split animals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>signifying a similar fate (being split in two) will result
to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one who breaks the covenant agreement.  GOD’s presence
moving between the bisected animals is the smoking fire pot and flaming torch. 
Not told in these verses is that Abram probably walked between the “cut”
animals also.  Some scholars would say that if the covenant was unilateral –
GOD alone being bound by the covenant – then Abram would not have to walk
between the split animals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist recalls that GOD is always faithful to the
relationship- covenant that GOD made with Abraham and his descendants.  GOD
will remember the covenant forever (not just for a thousand generations (the
Hebrew word can mean a time period longer than a generation).  A “thousand” – a
huge number in ancient times – would be comparable to “infinite,” a word that
would not have been in ancient Hebrew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus ask His disciples to look beyond
external appearance.  More important than superficial coverings or attitudes is
the “fruit” of one’s action.  If the “fruit” of one’s life is growth-filled and
positive, it speaks loudly of the person’s real orientation and
responsibility.  The product of one’s action does not produce GOoDness or
reward.  It is the awareness of the source of life (GOD)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the divine gifts already given that enable the GOoD
fruit to be borne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One key thought that strikes me from the readings is the
starting point of all that is GOoD.   GOD is the origin of all that is GOoD. 
GOD only produces GOoD.  The covenant that GOD offers Abram is GOoD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abram’s response to GOD’s GOoD covenant produced GOoD fruit
– not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>just in Abram’s offspring, but in the world.  GOD continues
to produce GOoD fruit.  The best fruit which GOD gave to us was the divine Son.
Jesus is not just the fruit of the womb of Mary, He is the fruit of GOD.  No
greater fruit has been or could be produced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to invite us to “taste and see” the GOoDness
that is offered.  If we accept the GOoDness of the LORD, then we will also
produce </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD fruit as a response to the GOoDness we have tasted and
seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This continues to challenge me to come to the Lord Jesus and
feast on all the GOoDness that Jesus offers.  I do that by reading the Word,
contemplating the Word, and receiving the Lord Jesus sacramentally.  That is
the Food that/Who nourishes me and allows me to bear GOoD fruit in response to
the GOoDness I have received from the GOoD GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What GOoD allows
me to bear GOoD fruit? What GOoD fruit do I bear?  Can people experience the
GOoDness of GOD through my bearing GOoD fruit? Who might benefit most from the
GOoD fruit that I bear and how can I help them taste and see the GOoDness of
GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of all GOoDness.  It is
from Your GOoDness that You continue to offer a covenant relationship to us,
even though we are not worthy of Your GOoDness.  You ask us to “taste and see”
Your GOoDness, especially as manifested in Your Son, Jesus, and His life,
teaching, ministry, death and resurrection.  Help us to acknowledge You as the
origin of all that is GOoD in our lives.  May we always give You thanks and
praise as You empower us to bear Your GOoD fruit.  We make this prayer in the
name of Jesus, Your Son and Your greatest GOoD for us, Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Raymond Lull:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-raymond-lull</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 16: 1-12, 15-16;        Psalm 106: 1b-2,
3-4a, 4b-6;        Matthew 7: 21-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A call for obedience to GOD flows through the readings
today.  The English word, “obedience” comes from the Latin words ob - audire
that means “to listen to. . .”  We hear about the obedience of Abram’s servant
in the First Reading.  The psalm calls blessed those who observe what is right
and do what is just.  In the Gospel, Jesus call His disciples to more than an
intellectual consent to being in relationship with Him.  He asks that they
“listen to” Him and act upon what He says and teaches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account from Genesis, that is today’s First Reading, may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sound strange.  Because Sarai (later to be called Sarah)
could not bear children, she gives her servant (Hagar) as a concubine to Abram
(later to be called Abraham).  Through Hagar, Sarai would give children to
Abram.  This was a common practice of Abram’s day and age.  Sarai seems to lack
self-confidence and also to lack trust in GOD.  She feels like a failure in
producing children.  Then Sarai becomes annoyed with Abram and Hagar because
Hagar seems to be gloating in her position as the bearer of Abram’s child. 
Abram empowers Sarai with permission “to do whatever” she wants to Hagar. 
Sarai makes Hagar’s life so miserable that Hagar runs away, even though she is
pregnant.  GOD’s word comes to Hagar and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promises Hagar a special place in GOD’s plan for both her
son and his offspring if she returns to Sarai.  The name given to the son of
Hagar is Ishmael meaning “GOD listens.”  Obediently Hagar returns to Sarai and
Abram.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is interesting to me is that it is from Ishmael (the
son of Abram and Hagar) that the Arabic and Islamic people trace their lineage
back to Abraham.  So, from the time of Abraham (the father of both the Jewish
people and the Islamic people), the ancestors of the Jews and Muslims have been
quarreling with each other.  According to this passage in Genesis, GOD even
describes Ishmael as “a wild ass of a man, whose hand is against everyone, and
everyone’s hand against him; in opposition to all his kin shall he encamp.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm seems to bridge the readings.  It speaks about
those who observe what is right.  Hagar does what GOD commands in her returning
to Sarai and Abram.  Abram is also righteous in his obedience to GOD’s will. 
In the Gospel, Jesus will speak about what righteousness entails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus describes what is essential to enter
into the Reign of GOD.  It is more than saying the right words and declaring an
allegiance to the Lord Jesus.  It requires the believer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to live out one’s belief by seeking to do GOD’s will. 
“Listening to” the Lord Jesus and acting (“obedience”) is what anchors one on
the Rock (Jesus).  If one has a foundation on the Rock, then even tough times
and stormy conditions will not be able to destroy a person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflection today centers on how important it is to obey
GOD’s plan for one’s life.  Seeking to do GOD’s will is more important than
being able to trace one’s lineage back to Abraham, the father of faith in the
one true GOD.  Jews can do that, Muslims can also.  Yet, it does not seem that
they always “listen to” and act upon (“obey”) what GOD would have them do.  GOD
wants all of the children of the LORD to respond and do what GOD wants.  GOD
desires that all people accept the GOoD News and live it out by loving </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others and welcoming them into the Reign of GOD.  If the
members of the three monotheistic (“belief in one GOD”) religions would really
“listen to” their GOD, they would work together and care for each other and do
GOD’s will.  Yet, as typical with children in the same family, they can only
see GOD’s plan from a very narrow perspective, their own perspective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does this mean to me personally? I sense that I must
faithfully “listen to” GOD’s Word, particularly as proclaimed by the Son of
GOD, and act upon that Word.  Yes, I must be caring for others who also call
upon the GOD of Abraham.  If I have true love and concern for others, however,
I will want them to come to know GOD as revealed by Jesus.  I will work to make
the GOoD News understandable to them.  That does not mean that I will water
down Jesus’ teachings, but I will be obediently faithful (and faithfully
obedient) to them by living a life that reflects Jesus’ ministry and that
invites others to listen and respond to the Gospel as Jesus preached it.  I
should strive to proclaim the Gospel in a way that others (whether they be
nominal Christians, Jews, Moslem, or non-believers) can sense that I am not
just mouthing words.  They should be able to say of my convictions and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my authority (that are not mine at all, but the Lord Jesus’)
that I, like Jesus, teach, live, and act with a power and authority that is not
like that of others, but has true connection with one true GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is not an easy task.  Yet, if we realize that it is GOD
Who is calling us to respond and we can be faithful and obedient servants of
the Lord Jesus, then we will be able to rejoice as more and more people draw
into the true relationship with GOD, in and through Jesus.  We will then be
able to echo the psalmist today and say, “Visit me with Your saving help, that
I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, rejoice in the joy of Your
people, and glory with Your inheritance.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What type of
listener am I?  Do I only listen to what I want to hear and act only in ways I
want? Do I truly listen to GOD and seek to do what the Lord Jesus wants, even
if it leads to others’ mistreatment of me? Can people see my obedience to GOD’s
Word by the way I treat them?  Does my living out GOD’s Word invite others to
come, taste, and see the GOoDness of the LORD? What can I do today to reflect
to at least one other person the joy of being one of GOD’s people who hear
GOD’s Word and respond accordingly?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the one and only GOD.  Through
Your GOoDness, You have called people to “listen to” and respond to Your plan
from ancient times.  You called Abraham to a unique relationship with You as
the one and only GOD.  Through Abraham, You have offered a special relationship
to his descendants, both those of the slave woman (Hagar) and the free woman
(Sarah).  Yet, their descendants have often failed to truly hear You and obey
Your divine plan.  Through Your Son, Jesus, You have called others to “listen
to” and obey Your will.  Many, including us at times, have listened only to
what they/we have wanted and not fully responded. For the times we have not
been obedient to Your calling, we seek Your forgiveness and pardon.  Through
the power of Your Holy Spirit, helps us truly open our ears to the Word, and
act upon the Word, as spoken through Jesus, Your Son, for He is Your Word
Incarnate.  Enable us to live lives that invite others to come to Him as the
Way to You.  May we always obediently follow Jesus, for He is Your Son, our
Brother, and our Master-Teacher, Who leads us back to You in Your Reign in heaven,
where He is living and reigning with You and the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just a note about today’s feast:  It is a moveable feast in
the Roman Catholic Church’s calendar.  It is always celebrated on the third
Friday after Pentecost.  The purpose of the feast is to honor Jesus and His
Sacred Heart.  In most Western cultures, the heart is a symbol for love and
devotion, so today’s readings focus on the love GOD has for those whom GOD has
called to be in relationship with the GODhead.  This loving relationship is
linked to the image of the GOoD Shepherd Who not only makes sure that sheep are
fed, and the lost and wayward sheep are found, but He is willing to lay down
His life for the sheep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading comes from the section of the prophet
Ezekiel in which words are addressed to those who are entrusted with the care
of GOD’s people.  Since the culture was well aware of the pastoral role of
shepherds, the imagery of shepherding the flock had a great significance.  GOD
is promising to take care of the divine flock since the local shepherds have
not cared for the sheep as GOD ordered them to do (as seen in the verses that
precede today’s verses).  GOD will not only lead the flock to their homeland,
but the LORD will be sure that the flock is well fed and protected from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anything that could harm the sheep.  GOD provides rest,
security, and healing for all the sheep.  GOD promises that One will come Who
will shepherd the divine flock as if the One was shepherding just as GOD would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is the familiar Psalm 23 in which the
psalmist declares that the LORD is the Shepherd Who leads the sheep to safety
and allows no fear or harm to come upon the sheep. The sheep will receive plenty
of food, even in the sight of the enemy of the flock.  Nothing will be able to
separate the sheep from the love that the Shepherd has for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Reading describes the attitude of GOD toward
those whom GOD loves in and through Jesus.  St. Paul asks the Romans to think
about what it takes for an individual to be willing to lay down one’s life for
another.  It is rare that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anyone risks his/her life for another.  It might be possible
for someone to give up life for the sake of a loved one.  Yet, Jesus was
willing to give up His life while we were enemies of GOD because of our
sinfulness.  This proves Jesus and His Abba-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father’s great love for us.  Jesus died for us and our sins
in order that we might realize the great love GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is from Luke’s description of Jesus as the
Shepherd Who is willing to search out the lost and bring them back into the
safety of the flock.  The image is that this Shepherd is willing to risk
everything to rescue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who stray away from the flock.  The pericope also
reminds us that we should rejoice when the wayward sheep is brought back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on Jesus and today’s feast of His Sacred Heart,
I am reminded, through the readings, how much Jesus and His Abba love each and
every person, including me.  GOD has more than gone out of the divine way to
search us out and bring us to safety, relaxation, and nourishment.  Nothing can
separate us from the love </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of GOD poured out in Jesus.  Jesus has been willing to lay
down His human life in a painful death in order to bring me into a closer
relationship with Himself and His Abba.  I do not deserve the love that GOD has
bestowed on me in and through the death and resurrection of Jesus.  I truly
have been out of sorts with GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through my sinfulness.  Yet, it is because I have alienated
myself from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Lord Jesus that GOD has seen fit to send the GOoD
Shepherd in search of me.  The Shepherd risks everything to bring me back from
the clutches of death, back into the life of the divine flock, and thus, we are
given the best food and protection possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only should I rejoice in GOD’s saving me, but I should
also take great pleasure that the Lord Jesus continues to search out all the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wayward sheep.  What is even more unbelievable is that the
Lord Jesus is asking me to not only rejoice in the return of all the strays,
but also GOD is asking me to join in the search of those who are away from the
divine flock.  I am called to imitate the GOoD Shepherd and show His divine
love for others.  It is then that I need to echo the words of the psalmist
today and address my Shepherd and say:  “Even though I walk in the dark valley,
I fear no evil; for You are at my side with Your rod and Your staff that give
me courage.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How can I manifest
the love that flows from the Sacred Heart of Jesus?  What can I do to help
shepherd the flock of the Lord Jesus and to lead them to a better understanding
(experience) of GOD's love? Who is most in need of the love of the Lord Jesus
today and how can I help him/her/them experience that love?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, our Father – our Abba.  Through
Your GOoDness, Your Son has come to us as the GOoD Shepherd Who seeks to
restore Your flock to the close relationship with You.  Jesus has walked</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>among us in search of all of us who have strayed from the
security and safety of Your presence.  For our wayward journeying, we seek Your
continued forgiveness and pardon.  Help us to hear the voice of Your Son as He
calls out to us.  Let us realize what He has been willing to endure in order to
bring us to You.  May we go out and minister and serve those whom You have
entrusted to our care so that they will know the great love You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have manifested in and through Your Son and His death and
resurrection.  May we rejoice as more and more of Your flock return to the
blessings of Your presence.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, the GOoD
Shepherd, Who has opened His Sacred Heart and poured out His loving blood for
us.  He is the One Who is reigning and living fully with You and Your Holy
Spirit, in the realm to which we are called, for You are our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[Just a note about today’s Gospel reading: it is taken from
the Memorial of the Immaculate Heart of Mary.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith and respect by mortals can lead to great deeds being
done by GOD.  The First Reading is a prediction of the birth of Isaac, the son
of Abraham and Sarah.  GOD fulfills the divine promise to give an offspring to
Abraham.  The Responsorial is the prayer of Mary known as the Magnificat (the
Latin word that begins the prayer “My soul magnifies [proclaims the greatness
of] the LORD. . .”)  In this prayer Mary praises GOD for fulfilling the
promises made to Abraham.  The Gospel shows both the trust and faith Jesus and
His mother had in GOD’s plan and how Jesus continued to be obedient to His
earthly parents, while Mary treasured all these things in her heart.  Mary, in
turn, demonstrates that she is the first disciple of Jesus and learns more
about His role</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>while she demonstrates her other responsibility in caring
for her Son — GOD’s Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True to the culture of his time, Abraham offers hospitality
to three strangers who pass his tent pitched near the tree (terebinth - oak) of
Mamre.  At first, Abraham does not realize that the strangers are the LORD GOD
and angels.  Abraham goes out of his way to provided hospitality by providing
“a little food.”  He tells Sarah to take almost three measures of flour (about
90 pounds) in order to prepare rolls.  Abraham, himself, chooses a tender
choice steer to be slaughtered and prepared for the guests.  Obviously, it
would not be a fast food meal for Abraham’s guests, but more food than three
visitors (together with Abraham and Sara) could have eaten at one meal. 
Abraham serves his visitors himself rather than have one of his own servants
serve them.  After the three have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>enjoyed the generosity of Abraham, they issue a promise that
the ninety-year-old Sarah will give birth to a son within a year’s time.  As
the hundred-year-old Abraham hears this prediction, he realizes that the LORD
is the guest he has been serving.  Sarah, who has been listening in the tent
beside the place where the guests are feasting, laughs to herself and doubts
the words of the strangers.  Then when Abraham is questioned about her
laughter, she denies her lack of belief in the prediction.  In contrast to what
we hear today, in yesterday’s first reading, it was Abraham who laughed and
thus the son is given the name Isaac (which means “laughter”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast to the doubts of Sarah, the Responsorial
presents the joyful affirmation of GOD’s power and fulfillment of promises as
proclaimed by Mary.  She realizes that GOD is to be praised for all the great
things that happen, especially the ways that GOD brings the divine promises to
life,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>literally, in the conception of Jesus within her womb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel demonstrates Jesus’ obedience not only to His
Abba- Father’s will but to the human parents GOD has given Jesus to watch over
Him as He grows up.  Jesus is obedient.  Jesus, Mary (His mother) and Joseph
(His adoptive father) have learned how important it is to trust that GOD will
take care of those who seek to do what GOD wants them to do. They realize that
they must reflect and treasure all that GOD has done and will continue to do in
their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder the readings, I think of my life and how I am
called to be like Jesus and Mary as they process what is happening in their
lives and what it means for the mission of sharing the Word of GOD with others.
He, in His youthful human exuberance, believes He should begin by interacting
with the Jewish leaders in the Temple.  He believes that He </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should be about His Abba’s business.  Mary and Joseph do not
realize that Jesus is not traveling with the caravan. According to some
scripture schools, Jesus is at the point of becoming a Jewish man and not just
a child.  As a child, Jesus used to travel with the women and young children
when traveling to and from Jerusalem.  Yet as a young man (a boy became a man
around the age of twelve), Jesus can be traveling with the men in the caravan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not until the end of the first day of travel, as the
pilgrims gather in their basic family unit, that Mary and Joseph realize that
Jesus has been traveling neither with Mary (and the women and children) nor
with Joseph (and the men and older boys).  At the dawn of the next day, Mary
and Joseph hasten back the one-day journey to Jerusalem.  After a probably
sleepless night, they search for Jesus on the third day, and they find Jesus in
the Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the experience, Mary reflects on what has happened and
turns the events over in her heart.  Probably, Jesus also reflects on His days
in Jerusalem and begins to realize how and when He will begin His ministry of
announcing the GOoD News of His Abba.  He comes to the awareness that it is not
the right time to fully proclaim the Word of GOD.  When the time comes, He will
announce the Gospel whether it is convenient or inconvenient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of a song that I have heard many times.  The
title is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where Do I Go.  Part of the lyrics say:  “Where do I go when
I need a shelter? Where do I go when I need a friend? Where do I go when I need
some helping? Where do I go? Back on my knees again.” Falling down on our knees
in the presence of our GOD and humbly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seeking GOD’s help is what we need to do again and again. 
It is then that we will be able to go forth and proclaim the Word by our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>actions, and our words if necessary.  And at some point, we
will also realize, as St. Paul does at the end of his Second Letter to Timothy,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that if we have done all we could have done, then we will
receive the crown of righteous that has been prepared for all who have shared
the Gospel with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often do I fall
on my knees in humble submission to the Lord Jesus and reflect on what GOD is
doing in my life? Do I proclaim the Word of GOD only when it is convenient and
comfortable, or do I give witness to the Word even when it is challenging?  Am
I willing to reflect on the events of my life and treasure how GOD is working
in my life, as Mary did?  To whom might I be called to minister today? This
weekend? Do I rejoice and praise GOD that I have been chosen to continue to
proclaim the Gospel to them even when it is inconvenient for me to do so?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever patient and always willing
to share Your GOoD News with us. Through Your GOoDness, You call us, the
disciples of Your Son, to preach His Word at all times, in GOoD times and bad. 
We often want to take the easy, glorious way of sharing the Gospel.  Yet, we
are called to announce the message and teach the truth particularly when we do
not fully understand what we must do (as Sarah did in today’s First Reading)
and we meet opposition. We need the guidance of Your Holy Spirit so that we
will know the best way to correct, reprove, and appeal to others. We also need
to take the time to reflect on how You are moving mightily in our lives, as You
did in Mary’s life with Jesus.  Continue to give us the patience we need,
especially when we are faced with those who do not want to acknowledge Your
truth. We give You all the praise, honor, and glory, as we sing Your mighty
deeds. As always, we do all of this in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Master-Teacher, Who is to be praised together with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saints-peter-and-paul</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Acts 12: 1-11;       Psalm 34: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7,
8-9;       2 Timothy 4: 6-8, 17-18;       Matthew 16: 13-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul. 
The First Reading and the Gospel focus on St. Peter, while the Second Reading
centers on St. Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading gives us a glimpse of some of the trials
that St. Peter experiences in standing up for His relationship with the Lord
Jesus. We hear how he is imprisoned for preaching about the “Name.”  GOD still
has many plans for Peter, so Peter is set free from bondage to continue his
ministry of leading the Church by his proclaiming the Gospel (GOoD News) of
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up on theme of the story of an angel
(messenger) of the LORD rescuing the one who faithfully follows the LORD.  We
proclaim:  “The angel of the LORD will rescue those who fear the LORD.”  GOD
answers those who seek to do GOD’s will.  Sometimes GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>literally frees those who are imprisoned.  Even if physical
deliverance is not provided, GOD always provides the strength necessary to face
the challenges that accompany those who follow the path of the Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul, in his letter to his apprentice (Timothy),
declares the fact that he (Paul) has done what GOD has asked him to do.  He
senses the end of his ministry and realizes that he has kept the faith, in
fact, he has spread the faith.  Paul knows that GOD will reward him, not
because Paul did a decent job, but because GOD keeps the divine promises and
brings those who seek the Way of the Lord Jesus into the promised reign of
heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from Matthew’s Gospel is St. Peter’s declaration
of faith in Jesus and Jesus’ proclamation of Peter’s role in the edification of
the Church.  All those who, like Peter, profess their belief in the Messiahship
and Divinity of Jesus will also be part of the building up of the Church – the
Body of Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can remember as a child hearing the stories of St. Peter
and St. Paul.  I looked up to these super-heroes as much as I did to Superman,
Hop-along Cassidy, Zorro, Davy Crocket, and the other heroes of my youth.  In
fact, I held them in higher esteem because they seemed almost perfect, after
all they were saints!  I almost believed that they were dropped out of heaven
as perfect saints.  Yet as I grew and began to read scriptures and biographies
more closely, I realized that these two men, St. Peter and St. Paul, were quite
flawed in their lives. They did not always act like super-heroes.  That led me
to wonder why Jesus would choose such individuals to be the key building blocks
in the structure of His Church.  Couldn’t Jesus have picked some other “more
perfect” characters to be our role models?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wisdom of GOD is once again manifested in the very fact
of choosing sinful, errant individuals to be the cornerstone of the living,
human and divine, edifice known as the Church.  If Jesus would have chosen
persons who were almost flawless, we would not have been able to as easily
identify with them, thinking they and their lives of holiness were way beyond
our reach.  Jesus selected a rough fisher who often acted without thinking
matters through, in order to show us that GOD can use even coarse stones to
make a beautiful structure.  In fact, it seems, that GOD prefers the rough
rocks so that GOD can chip away at them and shape them into the form needed so
that the edifice will have a firm foundation.  Jesus, the Rock of Salvation,
chose a man named Simon bar Jonah, and selected him to be part of the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>structure’s foundation, upon which all the rest of us would
be built.  Jesus gives this fisher the name Cephas (in Greek Πέτρος [Petros])
meaning “the rock” – the rock on which the Church would be built.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So also, Jesus chose the ultra-conservative and traditional
Jewish Pharisee and tent-maker (Saul of Tarsus) to announce the message of
salvation to those who were not Jews and who were made out of a different material
than the believers of old.  Thus, Saul of Tarsus become Paul, the Apostle to
the Gentiles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both Peter and Paul had to go through a lengthy process in
order to grow in their understanding of, and their relationship with, the GOD
Who had called them to be the foundation of this new structure of GOD’s
revelation. That should give us hope and strength.  We also have to go through
a lengthy process.  We need to have our rough edges chipped away and our
hardness molded into a form and a shape that can build on the faith of those
who have gone before us and become the stable layer upon which others may be
added to this living building of faith known as the Church – the Body of
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to come to know the Lord and Savior, whom St.
Peter and St. Paul grew to know and proclaim, we, too, will become part of the
Communion of Saints – for that is our calling and destiny.  It is a process
that takes a lifetime, yet a process that has already begun.  We are saints, at
least in the rough.  We can have a similar effect on others as did St. Peter
and St. Paul.  Like them, as we grow in our relationship with the
Master-Teacher, we will sense the need to share our faith with others so they
too can be part of the edifice of GOD’s holy and living temple.  Let us thank
GOD for giving us the very human, and yet the very saintly, role models in the
lives of St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I see the
life and ministry of St. Peter and St. Paul as compared to my own life and my
call to be a servant to others?  Am I strengthened in my faith as I realize how
the Lord Jesus transformed these sinful individuals into useful parts of the
structure of the Church of GOD?  What rough edges in my life does the Lord
Jesus need to shape into a form that GOD can use to continue to build up and
edify the Church?  How can I help inspire and affirm other people and their
roles as building blocks in the edifice of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, full of wisdom beyond our
understanding.  Through Your GOoDness and the ministry of, and calling by, Your
Son, You have chosen individuals like St. Peter and St. Paul to be instrumental
in the spread of Your Gospel.  You have selected individuals with whom we can
identify, giving us hope and courage that we can share in the sanctity of a
personal relationship with You as they did.  They were not flawless or sinless,
yet they were able to rise above their frail humanity and human limitations,
with the help of Your grace.  They were willing to follow the way of Your Son
in announcing the GOoD News of Your forgiving and healing love.  They
proclaimed this message because they had experienced it firsthand in their own
lives. We thank You and give You glory and praise for picking two very human
persons to be the main building blocks of Your Church.  We are grateful to You
for transforming these individuals, and us, into usable parts of Your edifice. 
We lift up this prayer to You in the name of Your Son, Jesus, for He is our
Savior and Lord, our Master and Teacher, the Foundation Stone and Capstone, Who
is one with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. 
Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Genesis 18: 16-33;         Psalm 103: 1b-2, 3-4,
8-9, 10-11;        Matthew 8: 18-22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Genesis account of Abraham haggling with the LORD
concerning the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah shows not only the Middle
Eastern propensity to barter, but more importantly (as the psalmist today
reinforces) the mercy of GOD.  The Gospel, in an apparent contrast, presents
Jesus as demanding a stricter adherence to His call than the filial obligation
to bury one’s dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham has a closer relationship with the LORD after he has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>entertained the LORD and two divine messengers (angels). 
GOD reveals to Abraham the divine plan to destroy the “sinful” Sodom and
Gomorrah. Abraham, concerned about his nephew Lot and his family, presents a
case for the saving the people of the two cities if enough GOoD people can be
found in the cities.  Starting at the number of GOoD people being fifty, he
works his way, politely yet respectfully, down to ten.  Ultimately Abraham
trusts in the mercy of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist echoes the sentiments of Abraham that GOD is
merciful and kind.  We are reminded that GOD does not treat us as our sins
deserve, otherwise there would be no hope for any of us.  Yet with confidence
we can come into the presence of GOD knowing that GOD is full of compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as two prospective disciples seek to follow
Jesus, He challenges them that being His disciples (disciplined and committed
followers) demands more than what they may be willing to accept.  They</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>give excuse about why they can not follow Jesus at this
time.  Jesus informs one that He has no place to call His own, thus there is no
earthly fringe benefits promised for joining the Union of Disciples.  To
another, Jesus demands a higher sense of allegiance than that of taking care of
the sacred family duty of burying the dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In seems that the readings are a bit at odds with each
other.  In the Hebrew Scripture (Old Testament) passages, we hear about the
mercy and kindness of GOD and in the Gospel account, we experience the demands
of being a disciple of Jesus.  These readings seem contradictory to most
people’s understanding of the GOD of the Hebrew Scriptures and the Jesus of the
Christian Scriptures.  As I was trying to make sense of the different readings,
I came to the understanding that Jesus does ask a lot of His disciples, but He
and His Abba are also merciful and kind.  Jesus sets the goal quite high, yet,
He also realizes that we may not always be able to achieve the goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I thought of my role as a teacher.  I expect a lot of my
students.  Even though I have been a computer science</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and a Latin and Greek instructor, I expect the students to
use proper English, spelling, punctuation, etc.  I demand ethical behavior.  I
set high demands, but I also am very generous and understanding of the mistakes
and imperfections of the students.  I may mark their errors so they are aware
of their mistakes, but as long as they generally try to do their best, they
should be able to earn an A in the classes.  I usually challenge the more
gifted students to reach a little further within themselves than the less
enabled students.  I am also willing to assist those who genuinely are seeking
to do their best but are struggling with the understanding and/or the workload.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus does set high expectations of His followers.  He wants
His disciples (including you and me) to do their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(our) very best.  He is there to support us as we struggle
through the hard times, but He keeps the goal high to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>enable us to stretch ourselves to our full potential.  And,
when (not if) we fail, He is there to lift us up with compassion, kindness, and
mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I think that
the Lord Jesus sometimes demands too much of me?  Do I see the demands as a
goal to strive for, not necessarily something that I will always be able to
attain?  How have I experienced the compassion, kindness, and mercy of GOD,
particularly when I have not been able to reach the high standards to which GOD
is calling me?  How can I challenge others to strive for the lofty goals that
GOD places before them and yet also reassure them of the compassion, kindness,
and mercy of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever kind and merciful.  Through
Your GOoDness, You desire to have an ever- increasing relationship with us. 
Through Your Son, You call us to a higher standard, to reach our potential.  At
times we have chosen the easy way out and not given our all to being disciples
of Your Son.  For those times we seek Your forgiveness and pardon.  Through the
power of Your Holy Spirit, empower us to stretch ourselves to fully follow Your
Son and make our relationship with You and Your Son the number one priority in
our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Savior and Brother, our Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 19: 15-29;                 Psalm 26: 2-3,
9-10, 11-12;                     Matthew 8: 23-27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fear, lack of faith, natural/supernatural calamities – our
readings cover all sorts of disasters.  In the First Reading, Abraham’s nephew,
Lot, is told to flee the city of Sodom before the LORD rains down sulphureous
fire upon it and Gomorrah.  In the Gospel, Jesus and His disciples are caught
in a violent “storm” at sea.  Failing to trust in the Word of GOD is manifested
by those who face such disasters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In readings of yesterday, we heard Abraham trying to bargain
for the safety of his nephew, Lot, and Lot’s family. Thus, because of the faith
and persistence of Abraham, GOD allows Abraham’s nephew and his family to leave
the sinful cities of the Aqabah or the Plains – the region around where the
Dead Sea is today.  The LORD warns them to trust in divine providence and not
to look back at the destruction that will be befalling Sodom and Gomorrah. 
Some scholars believe that an earthquake shook the area and caused the bitumen
in the region to burst out in flames.  It must have been a tremendous sound,
smell, heat, and shaking feeling.  Lot’s wife, either because of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>curiosity or not being able to believe that she and her
family would be spared, turns around and is turned into a pillar of salt.  Even
to this day, in the area to the south- east side of Dead Sea are geological
formations made partly out of salty material which the indigenous people point
to as what is left of Lot’s wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist, in a similar predicament to Lot, prays for
mercy from GOD so that he will not have to deal with the sinful and evil people
around him.  With GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there is safety for those who seek to do GOD’s will.  GOD is
truly gracious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, after a busy time of teaching and healing,
Jesus heads down to the sea with His disciples in tow.  After Jesus climbs
aboard a boat, He falls quickly asleep, trusting that His Abba-Father will see
Him (and His followers) through whatever He has to face.  As the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples travel across the sea, a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>terrific act of nature befalls them.  The Greek word
(óåéóìüò - seismos) used for the “storm” is the same as that for an
“earthquake.”  The tossing and rolling motion of the sea and violence attached
to it is truly sea-shattering (as opposed to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>earth-shattering).  Yet, Jesus sleeps peaceful in the boat
until His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples wake Him and beg Him to do something.  Before doing
anything, Jesus chastises them for their lack of faith.  He then calms the
angry sea, and the disciples are once again amazed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am reminded that natural
disasters are often called “acts of GOD.”  Does GOD really purposefully cause
earthquakes, fire storms, hurricanes,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tornadoes, and turbulent seas in order to scare the “heck”
out of us? Are we forced to experience such calamities so that we will trust
GOD more? Will GOD punish us with such phenomenon simply because we don’t trust
GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My own thoughts are that these phenomena are natural,
geological, meteorological occurrences that happen. Yes, the timing of them can
be signs to us of awesomeness of GOD’s power.  GOD has built in such phenomena </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into the creation that GOD has made.  Yes, GOD can use them
to cause us to reflect, but GOD doesn’t cause them to be “mean” to us.  GOD is
a loving GOD Who wants us to trust in divine providence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the fact that Jesus was able to peacefully
sleep in the boat that was being tossed about in the storm.  Jesus trusted in
the ultimate protection of His Abba.  He chides His disciples for not having
the same sort of faith in Him and His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, how often do we get upset and fearful when our boat
(either physical or emotional) gets rocked with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>little waves.  When things get rough, we call on the Lord
Jesus to help us by some extraordinary means, rather than trusting that GOD
will see us through the tough times.  We, like the disciples in the boat with
Jesus, want to “wake up” the Lord Jesus and have Him do something – for us –
and do it quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to have the trust of the psalmist who knows where to
stand – on the level ground of being in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD’s presence.  It is then that he is able to bless the
LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I sometimes
blame GOD for the natural occurrences that are part of living on earth? Am I
overly fearful of storms and earthquakes betraying my own lack of trust in
GOD?  How can I deepen my reliance upon the Lord Jesus in the midst of
physical, spiritual, and emotional tempests that affect my life? What can I do
to bring a calming sense of trust in GOD and GOD’s presence as other are tossed
about by the hardships that they face?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, always providing for us, even in
the midst of our stormiest and most shaky times.  Through Your GOoDness, You
invite us to deepen our trust in You.  For the times we have failed to place
confidence in You and Your loving protection, we seek Your pardon and peace. 
Guide us and bless us through the direction of Your Son and the gifts of Your
Holy Spirit.  May we always stand amid the assembly and bless Your Name.  We
ask that we may be more faithful to living out Your call to bring the message
of peace and justice to others.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son,
Jesus, our Savior and Brother, Who is living</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Oliver Plunkett:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-oliver-plunkett/
Readings:  Genesis 21: 5, 8-20a;             Psalm 34: 7-8, 10-11,
12-13;             Matthew 8: 28-34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today remind us that the LORD GOD is in
charge.  Ishmael, the son of Abraham by the slave woman (Hagar), realizes how
much GOD is in charge of Ishmael’s life.  The psalm proclaims that GOD hears
the cry of those who are the Anawim (poor, disenfranchised, outcasts).  In the
Gospel Jesus demonstrates His power over demonic forces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from Genesis is a parallel account to the story
of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sarai being envious of the relationship between Hagar and
Abraham and despising Abraham’s child from that relationship (Genesis 16).  It
seems a bit confusing in that according to some of the other passages in
Genesis, Ishmael would have been in his early teens at the time of birth of
Isaac.  Yet in today’s passage, it sounds like he is still just a little child,
hardly more than a baby himself.  Hagar and her son, Ishmael, are banned from
the family to which Ishmael rightly belongs. It is not because of Ishmael’s
negative behavior that he is exiled and disowned by his father, Abraham. 
Ishmael seems not to have been harmful to his younger half-brother Isaac, but
Ishmael played with Isaac, and in a positive way.  Yet, because of the jealous
rage of Isaac’s mother (Sarai/Sarah), Ishmael and his mother are separated from
Ishmael’s father, Abraham.  Abraham, too, is saddened to send</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>off his son.  The passage demonstrates GOD’s love not only
for the descendant(s) of Abraham through Sarah (formerly Sarai) but also for
the descendants of Abraham through Hagar, particularly when they cry out in
trust to GOD.  GOD promises Abraham that Ishmael will be come the father of
many people.  The followers of Islam trace their relationship back to Ishmael
and his father, Abraham.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a reminder that GOD hears the cry of the poor</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(disenfranchised, Anawim), and GOD comes to their aid.  This
is true of Hagar and Ishmael as they cry out to GOD in the First Reading.  GOD
cares for those who seek divine help.  I recall the song that John Foley, S.J.
created from this psalm.  His song is The Cry of the Poor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel account</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presents Jesus traveling into a Gentile region (to the
southeast of the Sea of Galilee).  Here He encounters two demoniacs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(persons possessed by demon[s]).   The evil spirits are
somewhat aware of Who Jesus is.  They fear His divine power and realize that,
in the final scene of the drama</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>between GOoD and evil, GOoD is going to win out.  They do
not want the final scene to be played out at this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that GOD is in
control.  GOD takes care of those who need divine help. GOD will ultimately win
the victory over evil.  Those thoughts give me a sense of both hopefulness and
a certain amount of trepidation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hopefulness comes from knowing that no matter how bad
things are, GOD is still there with, and for, me. At times I may feel rejected
and set apart on my own as did Hagar and her son, Ishmael.  I sometimes don’t
feel that I deserve the rejection I receive from others.  It is then that I
realize that GOD is with me in a way similar to the way Hagar and Ishmael were
aware of GOD’s presence with them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My feeling of trepidation comes from the fact that even
though Jesus has won the ultimately victory, there are still going to be
skirmishes between GOoD and evil.  And I may be, if I am not already, caught in
the midst of the conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Providentially (not luckily), the hopefulness outweighs the
fear.  There is more power in GOD than in the forces opposed to the divine
will.  And, like the psalmist, Hagar and Ishmael, all I need do is call upon
the LORD, trusting in the LORD Who is awaiting my prayer as the Responsorial
proclaims today:  “GOD hears the cry of the poor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced being oppressed and at my wit’s end? Was I able to cry out to GOD,
believing that GOD would respond to my call for help?  How did I experience
GOD’s presence at that time?  What can I do to assist others when they are near
the point of despair and call out to GOD for help?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all powerful and all loving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You never abandon those who call upon You with faith and
trust.  So often we forget about Your love for us and think we have to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>face our worst trials alone, without help.  Yet, You are
always listening for our cry for help.  If we trust You, You will demonstrate
Your loving power in mighty ways, maybe not always the way we want, but in ways
that are for our best.  We thank You for sending us Your very best – Your Son,
Who demonstrated Your care for others both in simple and profound ways,
especially through His suffering and death and resurrection.  With confidence
in Your care, we lift up this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Savior
and Brother, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Thomas, the Apostle:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-thomas-the-apostle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ephesians 2: 19-22;       Psalm 117: 1bc,
2;       John 20: 24-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we focus on the Apostle known as Thomas, a.k.a.
Didymus (or “Twin”).  He is often referred to as “Doubting Thomas.”  Our First
Reading reminds us that it was on the foundation of such individuals as the
apostles that the edifice of our common faith (the Church) has been built.  The
psalm urges praise of GOD for allowing the divine message to be proclaimed to
all the world.  Today the Gospel (presenting the account of Thomas’ reaction to
the Rising of Jesus) uses the name Thomas four times (of the eleven times the
name is mentioned in the New Testament).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his Letter to the Ephesians, St. Paul uses the imagery of
an edifice to refer to the Church.  The foundation of this building consists of
the apostles and prophets – those who are “sent” (apostlein) by GOD and those
who “speak for” (propheteuein) GOD.  It is upon the bases of apostolic and
prophetic tradition that the building of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is laid.  The crowning point of this building is none
other than Jesus.  He is the cornerstone (basis) and the keystone/capstone ἀκρογωνιαος
[akrogoniaios] “high” or “extreme” and “corner” - culmination and what/Who
holds together) of this structure.  St. Thomas played his part in this
edification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is interesting that as far back as the psalms (e.g.,
today’s Psalm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>117), there was a sense that GOD was to be glorified by all
peoples. Yet, the Jewish faith, as such, was very limited in its outreach.  It
was not until the apostolic days that monotheism (belief in the one and only
true GOD) was spread out to all the world.  The apostles took their title of
apostle literally, for they recalled Jesus’ words to “go out to all nations. .
.” (Mt 28: 19) and thus they believed that they were “being sent” to spread out
from Jerusalem to all the known parts of the world so that GOD could be
glorified by all nations, lands, and peoples.  We,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as members of Church (the edifice of GOD), continue in the
apostolic tradition.  We need to realize that we, too, are being sent out to
announce the GOoD News so that all peoples everywhere will give glory to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only in today’s Gospel, but also throughout the other
parts of the Gospel, Thomas, rather than being doubting, is actually very
pragmatic. He wants to have proof for his faith.  He shows a similar
practicality in John 14.  In that chapter, Jesus informs His disciples that He
is going to prepare a place for His followers.  Jesus reminds the apostles that
they know the way that He is going.  Thomas remarks, “Lord, we don’t know where
you are going, so how can we know the way?”  Thomas wants clear, exact directions. 
He wants to make sure that he really understands everything.  It is not that he
doubts what Jesus is teaching His followers. Thomas is saying, “Show me.”  (Was
he from Missouri - the “Show Me” state in the United States?)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the end of today’s Gospel, Thomas proclaims his faith in
one of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>most powerful statements about Jesus in the whole Bible: 
“My Lord and my GOD.”  Thomas proclaims that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is truly the Master of his life and one with the LORD
GOD of creation and salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a Bible Study I attend, we were discussing how people
come to faith.  Faith comes in different ways, at different times in different
people’s lives.  For some people, faith is something very concrete and real. 
It flows from personal experiences of the presence of GOD in their lives. 
Others are able to accept GOD’s word, confident that GOD will fill in the gaps
in their understanding.  The most important thing about faith is that it is a
relationship with GOD.  It is a result of GOD gifting us with divine life. 
Faith is not the product of our activity; it flows from the graciousness of
GOD.  Our activity should flow from our GOD-given faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I read the readings for today, my thoughts go back to
years past when I was a part of youth retreats.  I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>think, for many on the retreat, it was their first
experience of the presence of the Lord Jesus in a deeply touching way.  It was
made possible because the staff of other teenagers (together with the adults on
the team) were willing to be apostles and prophets (to “be sent” to the peers
and to “speak” GOD’s Word).  Faith became not just a list of things that they
could rattle off, but faith was also a personal relationship with a GOD Who was
manifested in the lives of other members of the edifice known as the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know at times in my life I, like Thomas, have wanted to
have proof that Jesus was (actually, is) alive and active in my life.  It is
not that I doubt that GOD loves me, I just want a little reassurance.  Yes,
Jesus says that those are blessed who have not seen and yet believed.  I,
however, along with Thomas and many others, just want to have a little extra
evidence of the hand of the Lord Jesus, even if I do not “see” the Lord.  I
want to experience His presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Thomas was bolstered in his faith, he (along with the
other spirit-filled apostles) went out to share this faith with others. 
[Thomas apparently went as far as India to share his faith.]   He was able to
testify about the risen Lord Jesus because he had experienced Him.  We, like
Thomas, should be willing to be “sent out” to share our experiences of GOD with
those whom we encounter.  Our own experience of questioning and coming to a
confident recognition of GOD’s movement in our lives should fortify us as we
let others know about our relationship with GOD.  And GOD does provide the
motive for our faith, just as GOD did for Thomas.  There are certain events in
our lives, especially as we look back, where we can say, “Yes, I was especially
aware of GOD’s presence at that moment.”  Those experiences can help in the
building up of the house of faith.  And it is those experiences that lead us to
proclaim our faith in Jesus as we say, “My Lord and my GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When I think of my
faith, do I see myself as a doubter, a demander of proof, or an unquestioning
believer? How does my reaction to faith determine the way I see myself as part
of the apostolic tradition – that is, a person called upon and sent out to
proclaim the GOoD News? Does my own faith help me deal patiently, yet firmly,
with those to whom I am being sent? How can I be more apostolic in my mission
to others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, always desirous to reveal
Yourself to us.  Through Your GOoDness, You continually gift us with reminders
of Your presence in our lives.  We sometimes allow our stubbornness to block
our full belief in Your touching of our lives.  We often want proof to support
our faith.  Your Son, Jesus, reminds us that the more time we spend with Him
listening to and reflecting on His words, the more we will be aware of Who He
is and Who You are, for as we come to know Jesus, we grow in relationship with
You.  Jesus has come</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to demonstrate Your divine caring and love for us.  He, the
Risen Lord, is the proof that You are alive and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>active in our lives.  We pray that we may be more aware of
the gifts of discernment, knowledge, and wisdom that flow from Your Holy
Spirit.  May the Spirit inflame our hearts with the courage to be sent out
(apostlein) to others to announce Your GOoD News.  And we pray that we may join
peoples of all nations, languages, and times in praising Your glory.  We make
this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Risen Lord, the Master Who
teaches us and sends us forth in His name, for He is living and reign with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Elizabeth of Portugal:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-elizabeth-of-portugal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 23: 1-4, 19; 24: 1-8, 62-67;      Psalm
106: 1b-2, 3-4a, 4b-5;        Matthew 9: 9-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mercy, faithfulness, and relationship with GOD take center
focus in our readings today.  Abraham shows the faith he has in GOD and GOD’s
giving to him the land in which he dwells.  The psalm praises the mercy and
kindness of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus proclaims that He has come to establish
a relationship between sinners and GOD, the GOD of healing and forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading combines a few stories together.  First,
we hear about the death of Sarah.  What is important about this passage is it
leads to the first owning of property by Abraham (and his descendants) in the
land promised to him (and them) by GOD.  Next, we hear about the dying</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>request of Abraham that a wife be found for his son, Isaac,
not from the indigenous people of Canaan but from his ancestral people.  This
is important to have the separation from Canaanites.  Although Abraham’s
relatives in Ur and Haran were not necessarily monotheistic and believers in
the one and only GOD in Whom Abraham</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>believed, they were of the same tribal lineage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for the mercy GOD has
shown to those who do the will of the LORD.  Abraham was truly faithful and
thus he and his descendants were blessed with mercy and the fulfillment of the
promises made to him and them.  The Hebrew word which is translated as “mercy”
is [c]hesed.  It is one of the two main characteristics of GOD.  It can be
translated as “loving- kindness,” “grace,” “mercy,” or “enduring love.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel relates the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>call of the tax collector named Matthew.  In response to
being called by Jesus, Matthew throws a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dinner party for Jesus and other tax collectors and known
sinners. (Tax collectors were considered public sinners by their fellow Jews
because they made money at the expense of their fellow countrymen and worked
for the foreign government which was oppressing the Jews.)  The self-righteous
religious leaders complain to Jesus’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples about Jesus’ associating with known and public
sinners. Jesus mentions that the sick, not the healthy, have need for a doctor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Americans, today we celebrate the 249th anniversary of
the Declaration of Independence in, I am reminded of the blessings which we
have been given by GOD to live in this country of freedom and democracy.  I am
also reminded (thanks to an old email with a commentary by Paul Harvey [the
commentary appears after today’s reflection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on a separate page and also in Video for the Day]) that our
country was founded by individuals who based their Declaration of Independence
on their relationship with GOD and the religious and moral implications of that
relationship with GOD.  Our country was a new “promised land” to be given to
those who were faithful to the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blessings bestowed by GOD just as Abraham of old was
faithful and grateful to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also recall that in many ways, we are like the religious
leaders in today’s Gospel.  We complain about the way our country is being
run.  We are often self-righteous in our attitudes and actions and forget that
GOD is the source of mercy and forgiveness and that we should turn to GOD in
praise and thanksgiving for what GOD has given us and given others.  We forget
that all of us, except the native Americans, have our ancestral roots in other
places, yet we are not willing to allow other “foreigners” to come to this land
and find the freedom that our ancestors found here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is faithful.  GOD will continue to bless those who seek
the divine will especially through the practice of peace and justice.  We as
individuals, and as a nation, are the ones who have been unfaithful.  We think
that freedom of religion means freedom from religion, and we want to separate
church and state so far that we will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not allow the Ten Commandments to be publicly displayed and
we desire to take “under GOD” out of our pledge of allegiance.  We think that
justice means we have to tolerate everyone doing anything he/she wants, even if
it is destructive of family values and community well-being, or it goes against
the religious values of our founding ancestors.  We want to water down the
principles on which this nation was built so as not to impose upon those who do
not wish to have a relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also reminded how much those who founded this nation
relied on GOD in their determination of what this country was to be like.  No,
there was not to be an established religion in the sense that everyone had to
be a Baptist, or a Lutheran, or a Catholic, or a Jew, or a Moslem, or an
atheist.  We were to be a people “under GOD” who could relate to our GOD from
our various and rich traditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel a real need to pray today for our nation, the United
States of America.  It has been led away from the foundation on which it was
founded.  Yes, I am an American citizen, but I am first and foremost a member
of the community of faith, the family of GOD.  My first allegiance is not to
the flag, but to the GOD Who overshadows the nation symbolized by the flag.  I
realize that I am in need of the GOD of mercy, and I pray that the GOD of mercy
will extend that gift to me and to our country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even though today’s psalm spoke about the people of Israel,
GOD’s first chosen people and nation, I will use the words of the psalmist to
pray for the United States and its people:  “Blessed are they who observe what
is right, who do always what is just; Remember us, O LORD, as You favor Your
people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I been
faithful to the GOD Who inspired the founding members of the United States to
create one nation “under GOD”? How can I be more supportive of the principles
on which this nation was originally created? For what personal and national
sins do I need to continue to seek GOD’s forgiveness? How can I help others
realize that this nation was conceived on the proposition that all people are
created equal and have certain rights given to them by GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever merciful and always just. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have desired to gather Your people into a nation who
would worship and praise You.  You continually shower Your blessing on those
who seek to be a nation “under You.”  We thank You for calling Your people of
old, the descendants of the faithful father of believers, Abraham.  We also
thank You for blessing the faithful founding fathers of our country who sought
to provide a place where people could worship You in freedom.  We have not
always been faithful – we have sinned against You and others, both individually
and as a nation.  We come together during this week when we celebrate the
anniversary of our political independence and seek Your mercy.  Although we
continue to declare our independence from other countries, we should also
announce our dependence on You. May we realize that we are the sick who need
the healing touch of Your Son, Jesus.  For our true freedom and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>liberty come ultimately from His death and resurrection.  To
You we offer this prayer of praise and thanksgiving in and through Jesus, Your
Son, for He is the true Liberator and Savior, Who is living and reigning with
You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I were the Devil I would gain control of the most
powerful nation in the world; I would delude their minds into thinking that
they had come from man’s effort, instead of God’s blessings; I would promote an
attitude of loving things and using people, instead of the other way around; I
would dupe entire states into relying on gambling for their state revenue; I
would convince people that character is not an issue when it comes to
leadership; I would make it legal to take the life of unborn babies; I would
make it socially acceptable to take one’s own life, and invent machines to make
it convenient; I would cheapen human life as much as possible so that the life
of animals are valued more than human beings; I would take God out of the
schools, where even the mention of His name was grounds for a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lawsuit; I would come up with drugs that sedate the mind and
target the young; I would get sports heroes to take on the job to advertise
them; I would get control of the media, so that every night I could pollute the
mind of every family, the backbone of any nation; I would make divorce
acceptable and easy, even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fashionable. . .If the family crumbles, so does the nation;
I would compel people to express their most depraved fantasies on canvas and
movie screens, and I would call it art; I would try to convince the people that
right and wrong are determined by a few who call themselves authorities and
refer to their agenda as politically correct; I would persuade people that the
church is irrelevant and out of date, and the Bible is for the naive; I would
dull the minds of Christians, and make them believe that prayer is not
important, and that faithfulness and obedience are optional; . . .come to think
of it. . .I guess I would leave things pretty much the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Genesis 27: 1-5, 15-29;         Psalm 135: 1b-2,
3-4, 5-6;         Matthew 9: 14-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We should rejoice in the plan of salvation as GOD reveals
it, through the apparently negative, and also the extremely positive,
experiences of life.  Our First Reading relates a story of dishonesty and
cheating, yet GOD’s hand is seen even in such events.  The psalm urges praise
of GOD.  The Gospel reveals a reason for being people of joy:  because the Lord
Jesus is with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading seems a bit strange to us as Christians. 
Jacob, the younger of the twin sons of Isaac, lies and cheats in order to
receive the blessing of inheritance from his old, poor-sighted, and dying
father.  Jacob is led to do so at the prompting of his mother, Rebekah, who has
always doted on the younger twin who is not as husky and strong as his older,
tougher brother, Esau.  A couple of things need to be said about the reading: 
first, the blessing of inheritance once given cannot be revoked; secondly, Esau
had sold Jacob his birthright when Esau had returned unsuccessfully from a hunt
and Jacob gave food from his pasture; thirdly, and most importantly, this story
is not told to hold up dishonesty and cheating as models to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be imitated by the faithful, but to show that GOD’s plan of
salvation can be worked out in spite of the weak, conniving, and sinful actions
of mortals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm builds on the third point.  GOD is to be praised
for allowing Jacob to be the source of blessing for the ancestors of
Israelites.  (Remember that Jacob</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>went through a name change and became Israel, the father of
the twelve sons [tribes of the Israelites].)  GOD is able to use the misguided
actions of mortals in order to bring the divine plan of salvation to the Chosen
People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel presents an encounter between the disciples of
John the Baptist and Jesus.  John (and some of the Pharisees) had preached an
ascetical lifestyle of penance, fasting, almsgiving, and prayer.  Jesus’ ministry
seemed to focus on rejoicing and celebrating.  When questioned about the
difference in approaches, Jesus compares His presence among His disciples to
that of bridegroom among friends.  While the guest of honor is present,
rejoicing should be the focus.  Once the guest of honor leaves or is taken
away, there will be time for more ascetical practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I read the scripture passages for today, I am left
wondering about my own life and its place in the plan of salvation.  In some
ways, I can see myself more like Jacob.  I have not always done what was
expected of me.  Yet, the LORD has, at times, used me in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>order to further the spread of the Gospel.  GOD is able to
manifest the divine plan even through, or may especially because of or in spite
of, the weakness of the human instruments, like Jacob and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I do not advocate the Skoptsy philosophy made famous by
Rasputin.  According to that philosophy, only through sinning do we understand
the forgiveness of GOD.  Therefore, according to Rasputin and the Skoptsy
philosophy, we should purposefully sin so we can be forgiven.  And Rasputin was
known for his perfecting (or should I say imperfecting) his sinfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on how GOD has worked in my life, I am able to
join the psalmist today and praise GOD for allowing the divine plan to unfold
in the lives of sinful individuals like myself.  I realize the focus should not
be on us, as instruments of GOD, but on GOD Who uses the imperfect tools in a
masterful way.  If we focus just on ourselves, then it would be equivalent to
praising the pen that a skillful writer uses or praising the paint brush that a
master artist uses.  GOD can use us with all our imperfections to write the
beautiful and moving story of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation in and through His Son, Jesus.  GOD, the divine
artist, uses us, imperfect brushes, to paint the Master’s peace/piece of
salvation – the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also feel challenged to strive to become an even better
instrument in the hand of GOD.  I should strive to better myself, not just for
my own sake, but rather for the sake of GOD and the proclamation of the GOoD
News.  Then I can rejoice in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presence of the Bridegroom Who is with me and I can lift my
voice with the psalmist and say:  “Praise the LORD, for the LORD is GOoD, sing
praise to GOD’s name, which we love.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I feel when
I realize that I am called to be an instrument that GOD uses to tell the story
of salvation and paint the “Big Picture” of GOD’s work among us? What can I do
to be a better instrument in the hands of GOD? What part of the “Big Picture”
can I help bring to someone today?  This weekend?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and forgiving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You enable us to see Your divine hand at work in spite
of the sinful actions of mortals.  We have been guilty of dishonesty and
cheating, and yet You have been willing to forgive and still announce Your GOoD
News story in the telling of our sinful episodes.  You, the Great Writer of all
history, perfected the storytelling in the person of Your Son, Jesus.  He came
to bring the Glad Tidings and the reason for rejoicing by His very presence
among us.  We thank You for never giving up on us and using us, the weak and
imperfect instruments that we are, in the relating of Your Strength and
Perfection.  We lift up this prayer of praise in the name of Your Son, Jesus,
our Brother and Savior, our Master-Teacher, Who gladdens us with His presence
now and in the fulness of Your Reign in heaven where He is now living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Maria Goretti:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-maria-goretti</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 66: 10-14c;                       Psalm
66: 1-3, 4-5, 6-7, 16, 20; Galatians 6: 14-18;                      Luke 10:
1-12, 17-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The call to, and the joy of, discipleship seem to play
center stage in our readings today.  The passage from Isaiah speaks of the joy
that comes from a relationship with GOD.  The Responsorial Psalm continues the
theme of rejoicing as one contemplates the great things that the LORD has done
for, and through, the Chosen Ones of GOD.  In the selection from his letter to
the Galatians, St. Paul writes of boasting in the cross of the Lord Jesus as he
mentions that he has been crucified to the world and the world to him as he
continues his ministry.  In the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel, Jesus sends out seventy-two disciples on their
missionary journey.  The second part of the Gospel (which is part of the
expanded reading) presents what happens when the disciples return from the
mission and describe their joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a beautiful use of imagery, the author of this section of
the Book of Isaiah describes the joy of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at being
nourished and nurtured first by the Holy City of Jerusalem and then by GOD. 
Just as a mother allows an infant to feed from her breasts, so the people of
Jerusalem will be nursed and comforted by the City of GOD, and, in reality, by
GOD.  One is left with a sense of peace, security, joy, and comfort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The joyfulness of the First Reading is echoed in the
Responsorial as the psalmist urges the whole earth to rejoice as all people
learn to reflect on the tremendous actions by GOD on behalf of those called by
GOD.  Joyful praise is the fitting response of those who have seen, and been a
part of, the marvelous deeds that the LORD does for the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul declares that he can boast
not because of what he has done, but because of what GOD has done in and
through the death of Jesus on the cross.  Not only has Jesus suffered and died
in order to unite the world to His Abba-Father, but Jesus has thus united His
disciples with the world, linking them as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a crucified person is connected to the cross through the
process of crucifixion.  Paul</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experiences the unity of purpose of Jesus’ death and those
who have been saved by His death.  Paul even proclaims that he bears the mark
of Jesus on his body.  He has suffered for the cause of salvation and is
therefore linked to the salvific event of Jesus’ suffering, death, and
resurrection.  This is not to say that Paul’s suffering causes salvation.  That
is only done by Jesus.  Paul joyfully and boastfully experiences suffering as
he furthers the message of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus commissions seventy-two of His
disciples to go out in pairs to proclaim the Gospel (GOoD News) message to the
towns where He will be visiting.  They are to act with complete trust in GOD,
not taking extra provisions, but relying on the power of the GOoD News for
their sustenance.  They will be taken care of by those who joyfully accept
GOD’s message of salvation.  They should also refuse to deal with any who
reject the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the excited disciples return, they relate the
experiences they have had in seeing “their” power over evil. Jesus refocuses
their attention to what is important, not the marvelous deeds they have done
(for it is not they who have done it, but GOD working in and through them), but
on the fact that the signs that they have performed show that they have their
names written in heaven, that is, they are in relationship with GOD and they
are doing GOD’s will on earth just as it is being done in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings I am caught up with the joy and
excitement of the call to discipleship.  It can lead to a truly enthusiastic
response as we realize and experience the marvelous deeds GOD works as Jesus’
disciples </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(including us) go out in His name and proclaim the GOoD
News.  I am also reminded that the reason for celebrating is not the miraculous
events that are being experienced, but rather the relationship that they
signify.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A comparison might be useful.  Two days ago, Americans
celebrated Independence Day.  In the evening people gathered to watch firework
displays.  The aerial flashes of bright colors led to the people’s expressing
their awe.  Yet the spectacular fireworks were really not what the holiday is
all about.  The fireworks were the ways we express the meaning behind the
celebration of our independence.  Our independence and freedom and our relationship
to the ideals of America were what we should have been celebrating.  The
fireworks were just signs of who we were called to be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar way the deeds that are done in the name of the
Lord Jesus, even though they may seem spectacular, are not (or at least should
not be) the reason for our joy.  The freedom as redeemed individuals and our
relationship to the Lord Jesus and His Abba is what should be at the center of
our joy.  The fact that we are called to be united with the suffering and death
and resurrection of Jesus and thus part of His saving work is what makes being
His disciples so special.  It should cause us to rejoice and be glad.  We have
been invited to be in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with the Master-Teacher and His loving and
nurturing Abba through the presence of their Holy Spirit in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more we realize and actualize the relationship that GOD
is offering us in and through Jesus, the more we can rejoice, and
coincidentally, the more we will be able to see GOD’s hand at work in our ministry-service. 
We, as Paul describes, must continue to boast in the cross (and resurrection)
of Jesus.  We have been united with Jesus, and through our relationship with
Jesus, we are called to go out and proclaim the GOoD News by our discipleship
and ministry-service.  We are called to be crucified to (be compassionate and
suffer with) those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whom we are called to serve as we are united with Jesus Who
has redeemed us and them.  This should be the source of our joy.  This should
be the reason for our celebration.  If there are “fireworks,” that’s okay, but
that is not what we are about.  We are being sent out to proclaim the GOoD News
of the Lord Jesus.  And in doing so, GOD will continue to nourish, nurture, and
provide for us more than a mother does for her newborn.  Let us “cry out to GOD
with joy!” as we proclaimed in the Responsorial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my reaction
when I see the marvelous “fireworks” which happen when the message of Jesus is
being proclaimed? Do I focus on the spectacular displays, or do I give thanks
to GOD Who has worked them in my life? How can I more effectively proclaim the
GOoD News of Jesus to those whom I meet this day, this week? Do I trust GOD
enough to proclaim the Gospel message without worrying about all the
incidentals?   Do I see GOD as a nourishing and nurturing Parent Who provides
for me in all circumstances?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving provider of all that we
need.  Through Your GOoDness, You draw us to Yourself and allow us to be fed
from Your very self.  Once we have received what will sustain us, You send us
out as disciples of Your Son, Jesus.  We are called to announce His message of
salvation.  You provide signs of Your presence with us as we proclaim Jesus’
death and resurrection.  At times we focus more on marvelous deeds that You
work rather than on Your relationship with us and those whom we serve.  For our
misguided attention, we ask Your forgiveness.  Continue to pour out Your Holy
Spirit so that we have the wisdom to keep our focus on what we should be
viewing and doing.  We want to give You all the glory, praise, and honor as we
unite ourselves with Your Son, Jesus.  For He is our Master-Teacher and Lord,
and He is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 28: 10-22b;              Psalm 91: 1-2,
3-4, 14-15ab;                Matthew 9: 18-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trust in GOD runs through our readings.  Jacob has an
encounter with GOD that leads to his affirming his trust in GOD.  The
Responsorial describes GOD as a refuge and a fortress, the object of one’s
trust.  In the Gospel, Jesus performs two miracles because of the trust/faith
that individuals have in Him and His healing power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On his way to find a wife from his ancestral clan back in
Mesopotamia, Jacob comes upon a place, most likely a sacred place to the local
people. Since the sun has already set, he decides to sleep at the place.  During
his dreaming in this “holy” place he has a vision of a “heap” or “ramp” or a
“ladder” (similar to the Babylonian ziggurat) that ascends into the heavens.
Angels (messengers) of GOD travel up and down the stepped structure. Jacob
experiences the presence of GOD in this Beth El (“Abode of GOD”). Jacob
promises to continue to trust in GOD and to erect a memorial at this place when
he returns from his mission to find a wife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist urges one of the faithful to have trust in GOD
and then the psalmist</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presents GOD’s response to that trust.  The psalmist first
urges the individual who is aware of the presence of GOD to trust in GOD and
proclaim a relationship with GOD, Who is the only security one needs.  GOD
promises to be with the one who calls out in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Gospel passage presents a miracle sandwiched between two
parts of another miracle. An official seeks Jesus’ help when his daughter dies.
Obviously, he has faith that Jesus can restore the child’s life.  While Jesus
is on the way to the official’s house, a woman who has been suffering from
bleeding for twelve years, approaches Jesus. She believes that if she touches
the hem of Jesus’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>garment she will be healed.  Because of her faith in Jesus,
she is healed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Jesus arrives at the home of the official, He is
ridiculed when He implies that the girl will “wake up” from her death and live
again.  Even though the crowd lacks faith in Jesus, the official still
believes, and because of that, the girl is restored to life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the scripture passages today, I realize I
need to examine my own level of trust.  I am asked to believe that GOD is
present and active in my life and that great things can (and do) happen the
more I place my trust in GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue celebrating American Independence Day from
three days ago, I think it is appropriate for us who are Americans to realize
that we are never independent from GOD, and that we, as Americans, should be
true to our motto:  “In GOD we trust.”  Trust is much more than saying
particular statements.  Trust implies that we act how we believe.  It is then
that we give witness to the relationship we are called to have with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was listening to a radio broadcast a while ago that spoke
about the healing power of faith.  Yes, GOD can and does provide healing for
those who cry out to GOD.  Some people have experienced that healing during the
pandemic that started five years ago.  Faith is an essential part of divine
healing, but GOD is not a vending machine in Whom you deposit a little bit of
faith and out pops a miracle.  First and foremost, faith is a relationship with
the Almighty [that is, GOD, not Bruce nor Evan nor the Dollar].  If we approach
our relationship with GOD with the sense that GOD will gives us what we truly
need and what is best for us, GOD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will respond, and GOD will do it appropriately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Expectant faith is what GOD desires us to have.  We should
expect (and look forward to) the hand of GOD moving in our midst, working
wonders, often through the ordinary events and people in our lives.  It is
still GOD working, and the more we have the faith relationship with the Lord
Jesus, the more we will be able to recognize GOD’s presence each and every day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do I have enough faith? No, I am still growing in faith.  Do
I expect to have GOD answer my prayers? Absolutely.  Will I get what I ask for?
Not necessarily.  Faith is not necessarily something that is demonstrated by
outward manifestations.  Faith is the growing relationship I have with a GOD
Who loves me and provides for me.  Just as other relationships are fluid and
not always measurable, so it is with my faith relationship with GOD. Yes, there
are signs of the relationship, but how I interpret the signs may be different
than the way the signs are given by the Other Member of the relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s response to my faith is that which is given in the
psalm today:  “Because they [the individuals who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>trust in GOD] cling to Me, I will deliver them; I will set
them on high because they acknowledge My name.  They will call on Me, and I
will answer them.  I will be with them in distress.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my trust
level with GOD? How much do I really trust GOD? Does my life reflect the trust
relationship I am called to have with GOD?   Do I manifest my trust in GOD in
the way I live as an American (or other nationality)? What can I do to help
others to live out the motto, “In GOD we trust”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever faithful and worthy of our
trust.  Through Your GOoDness, You continue to reach out Your healing hand to
those who seek a relationship with You.  You always answer our prayers, even
though we may not get exactly what we ask from You.  You always give us what is
truly best for us.  The greatest gift You have given us, was truly the very
best – Your Son, Jesus.  Throughout His earthly ministry, He demonstrated Your
desire to bring us salus – healing, well-being, salvation.  As with other
relationships in our lives, our faith relationship with You is dynamic.  We ask
that through the guidance of Your Holy Spirit, we may grow in a positive way in
that relationship.  Give us the wisdom and strength to spend time with Your
Son, our Master-Teacher, so that we can learn from Him and be His faithful
disciples (disciplined learners).  Bless us as a nation who not only have the
motto, “In GOD we trust,” but who also live out that trust in our daily lives. 
We make this prayer in His Name, Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who
is living and reigning with You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Gregory Grassi and Companions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-gregory-grassi-and-companions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 32: 23-33;        Psalm 17: 1b, 2-3,
6-7ab, 8b and 15;        Matthew 9: 32-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s presence is manifested in various ways.  In the First
Reading, Jacob experiences the face of GOD after wrestling with a divine being,
The Divine Being.  The psalm reassures us that in justice we can see the face
of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus reaches out with compassion so that people can
know how loving GOD is and that GOD is with them, especially during times of
hardship and difficulties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s passage from Genesis gives us the origin of the name
“Israel.”  Jacob wrestles with a Being who blesses Jacob with a new name: 
Israel – “one who struggles with GOD.”  Jacob takes the encounter as a sign of
GOD’s blessing, for Jacob/Israel has seen the face of GOD and is still is alive
to tell about it.  Jacob has struggled to understand and experience GOD.  Now
he has a better understanding of Who GOD is because he has seen GOD face to
face.  This was in opposition to the thought of the times that those who see
GOD do not survive the experience.  This passage is also used to explain the
origin of why the Israelites do not eat the sciatic muscle of animals since
Jacob’s sciatic muscle was injured in his struggle with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial picks up on the words of seeing the face of
GOD in the verse that says:  “Hide me in the shadow of your wings.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in justice shall behold your face.”  Seeing the face of GOD
could be taken as an euphemism for being in GOD’s presence or being in
relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues to minister to the crowds
because He had pity on the people who were like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sheep without a shepherd. From this passage and many other
passages, Jesus is seen as compassionate, and His compassion is what moves</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Him to perform miracles.  He also realizes that in His short
earthly ministry, He cannot physically reach out to all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those in need, so He asks His disciples to pray for more
workers in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s harvest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I read the scriptures for today, what strikes me the most
is the compassion of GOD.  GOD truly cares for all creation, especially human
beings.  Although GOD has created humans and blessed them with life and with
being made in the divine image, they need more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>than simply having life.  They need direction and guidance,
like sheep needing a shepherd.  GOD the Abba-Father has sent the best Shepherd,
Jesus.  Jesus sees people hurting, suffering emotional, physical, and spiritual
ailments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He reaches out His loving hand to bring them salus –
healing, well-being, salvation.  Jesus performs miracles not to “wow” the
people, but because people need to experience GOD’s presence with them.  Once
their needs and concerns are addressed and they have no more stumbling blocks
to their awareness of GOD’s presence with them, they are able to see the face
of GOD and live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ compassion does not end with His death, resurrection,
and His return to the right hand of His Abba- Father.  Jesus wants all peoples
to experience the reality of the presence of GOD.  Yet, some people are not
able to appreciate the presence of GOD because they need to sense being loved
and cared for by human hands.  Thus it is that Jesus implores His disciples to
pray that more laborers are sent into the vineyard of GOD, since there were,
and still are, so many people suffering and hurting and needing care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the story of the little girl who is afraid
of the dark.  On the first night she is to sleep without a night light, her
parents reassure her that she has nothing to worry about because GOD was with
her.  They turn off the light in her room and let her try to go to sleep.  In a
few minutes she cries out for her parents, who return to comfort her.  After
this cycle is repeated a few times, the parents ask her, “Why are you afraid?
Don’t you know that GOD loves you and is with you?”  The little girl responds
that she knows GOD loves her, but she remarks, “I want to be loved and held by
someone with skin on.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of us at times in our lives needs to be the lover with
skin on. We need to extend the compassion of a loving GOD, and enable people to
experience the presence of GOD by the way we care for them.  GOD is truly
present with all people at all times, yet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sometimes GOD chooses to manifest the divine presence in the
compassionate way people treat each other.  Let us be open to GOD’s revealing
of the divine presence both to us and through us, and let us continue to pray
with the psalmist today and say to GOD, “Show Your wondrous mercies.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
struggled with GOD, wanting to be able to see GOD face to face? What have I
learned from my struggle with GOD? How have I experienced the face of GOD when
I needed to be aware of the divine presence with me?    How can  I  best  be 
a  worker  in  GOD’s  field,  helping  others  experience  the compassionate
hand and loving face of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and compassionate. 
Through Your GOoDness, You not only have created us and given us life, but also
You continue to care for those who call upon You.  In the fulness of time You
clothed Your Son with human skin and allowed Him to reach out His human (as
well as His divine) hands in caring for Your people.  As Jesus walked this
earth, He was moved with human and divine compassion to help relieve the hurts
and pains with which people suffered.  He miraculously touched their lives with
Your presence and allowed them to see Your face as Jesus smiled on them.  Being
limited in His human body, He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>commissioned His followers to pray for, and be, workers in
Your field, to bring the abundance that You desired all to have.  We thank You
for those who have touched our lives with Your compassion and we pray that we
may be faithful laborers and compassionate care-givers so that all may see Your
face and live the fulness of the life You intend.  We come as Your children,
sisters and brothers of Your Son, to give You all the praise and glory that is
due You, in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the Compassionate
Master and gentle Teacher, Who gave us the example of loving service through
His ministry, life, death, and resurrection, and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 41: 55-57;  42: 5-7a, 17-24a;      Psalm
33: 2-3, 10-11, 18-19;       Matthew 10: 1-7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD can never be outsmarted or outguessed in the way of
saving people.  The passage from Genesis tells how GOD used the one-time slave
to provide for famine-struck individuals and nations.  The Responsorial Psalm
praises GOD for thwarting the deviant plans of mortals.  In the Gospel, Jesus
selects and commissions twelve lower class individuals to lead a first-rate and
most important process of announcing GOD’s gift of salus (healing, salvation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading is the encounter between Joseph and his
brothers who had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sold him into slavery.  Obviously, they do not recognize him
because now he is not a slave, but second only to Pharaoh.  They also do not
realize that Joseph understands their conversations because Joseph speaks
through an interpreter. Joseph is moved with love and forgiveness for his
brothers, but he also wants to be able to see his younger brother, Benjamin. 
Today’s passage starts half way through, and omits quite a bit of, the story of
Joseph.  The key point, which is picked up by the Responsorial, is that GOD can
use the negative plans of individual (and nations) and turn them around to
further the divine plan.  When Joseph was sold in slavery by his brothers, they
thought they would never see him alive again and that they were thus free of
the dreamer who had a vision of his brothers and other family members falling
down in homage to him.  GOD turned around the plight of Joseph and therefore
raised up Joseph so that he would be a source of blessing for the children of
Jacob-Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm urges a turning to GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for mercy.  The psalmist aptly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>proclaims that GOD foils the plans of people and brings
about salvation for the chosen people, even those who have tried to work
against the plan of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus calls forth and commission His twelve
apostles.  He then completes the process and makes GOoD on their new function
of apostles by “sending” (apostelein) them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>out to announce the GOoD News to the house of Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I read the readings today I am touched by the simplicity,
and yet awesomeness, of the plan of GOD.  GOD is able to not only create
something out of nothing, but to make what seems to make no sense into divine
wisdom.  What seems like a complete tragedy when Joseph is sold into slavery by
his brothers turns into a way that GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>takes care of the Chosen People.  No one would have dreamed
that a slave would become second in command of Egypt and be responsible for the
feeding of not only the Egyptians, but also the children of Israel, when a
famine strikes the Middle East.  No one would have dreamed that except GOD and
the dreamer to whom GOD gave the vision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similarly, who would have thought that twelve men from
diverse, mostly uneducated backgrounds, would </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>become the building blocks of GOD’s Church.  Who would have
picked four fishers, a tax-collector, and other individuals from the
hill(billy) section of Galilee to lead a world-wide spreading of GOD’s GOoD
News? No one would have picked such a band of misfits, no one except the Son of
GOD in the flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That gives me a sense of purpose.  If GOD can transform a
slave into a leader who saves at least two important nations, then GOD can
transform me into a useful tool in announcing the Gospel to one or more
individuals.  And if Jesus can empower a bunch of low caste individuals to
become key movers in the divine plan of salvation, GOD can empower me to do
what I can to make the salvific plan known to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded that GOD is source of all GOoD.  GOD can make
even apparently negative or unimportant experiences turn into means of
furthering the divine plan.  I am part of GOD’s plan.  Through me, GOD’s
message of salvation can reach some people.  The focus, however, is not to be
on me, but what GOD can do, using me.  GOD wants me to assist in this plan. 
GOD has empowered me and chosen to need me.  For my part, I must do the best job
I can in proclaiming the divine message, and then I must trust that GOD will
sanctify my efforts and make people open to the divine message that is being
presented by such a meager instrument as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>myself.  And once I have done my best to present the message,
if the message is not accepted, it is not me they reject but GOD Who works
through me.  I must still praise and give GOD all the glory.  The same is true
for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   In what ways have
I sensed GOD using me to bring the GOoD News to others? How can I be more
attuned to GOD’s calling me to be an instrument in the spread of the Gospel?
Whom can I reach today, reassuring them of GOD’s loving care?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, all-knowing and completely wise. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have a plan for people to share in Your love for
ever.  You are able to use imperfect, sinful individuals and negative events to
bring about Your divine will.  Although we have missed the mark (sinned) in
many ways, and we have failed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to live up to what You have desired for us, You are willing
to forgive us and start over as we turn ourselves more fully toward You, in and
through Your Son.  Continue to send Your Holy Spirit upon us to empower us to
be the best instruments in Your divine hands.  And help us always to point back
to You and give You all the glory and praise as we see others draw closer to
You.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and
Brother, Who continues to call workers into the field of salvation to announce
the GOoD News.  It is He Who is our Master-Teacher and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-veronica-giuliani</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 44: 18-21, 23b-29, 45: 1-5;      Psalm
105: 16-17, 18-19, 20-21;         Matthew 10: 7-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The benevolence of GOD is manifested in today’s readings. 
The story of Joseph continues as he reveals himself to his brothers.  The
psalmist retells the story of Joseph focusing on GOD’s fulfillment of the divine
plan of providing for the Chosen People.  In the Gospel reading, Jesus
“apostles” the twelve with the “mission” to proclaim the GOoD News and He
commands them to trust that GOD will provide for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s reading from Genesis is the conclusion of the passage
in which Joseph’s brothers return to Egypt with their youngest brother,
Benjamin, Joseph’s full brother (son of Joseph’s mother).  Today’s pericope is
the Reader’s Digest version and conclusion of the whole passage.  If one would
read the whole story, we would hear that after the brothers have purchased the
provision a second time, they leave.  Joseph has ordered that their money be
returned and that his own silver goblet be placed in Benjamin’s bags.  When</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the brothers are stopped and their bags searched, Joseph’s
silver goblet is found in Benjamin’s bag.  The brothers are shocked and
dismayed.  Judah, in whose care Benjamin has been placed, is willing to be
punished in place of Benjamin, thus becoming a goel or “redeemer.”  It is at
this point that Joseph reveals himself to his brothers.  He explains that he is
not angry with them for their selling him into slavery.  He recognizes the
providence of GOD in the act, because if Joseph had not been led away to Egypt,
the children of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jacob/Israel would have suffered the effects of the famine
striking their part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist praises the forethought and kindness of GOD who
was able to save the Chosen People even though the ten brothers of Joseph had
sold him into slavery. GOD’s providence surpasses the evil plans of mortals. 
GOD is kind and merciful and forgiving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus “apostles” (“sends out”) the twelve on
their “mission” (job for which one is “sent”).  They are to proclaim the GOoD
News and trust in GOD. They are to take no extra supplies, money, nor travel
accessories.  Those to whom they are being sent will receive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them with shalom (peace) because they announce the message
of the Prince of Shalom.  Since they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>come in the name of the Lord of Shalom, those who are open</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the message of Jesus will lovingly receive them and take
care of the apostles’ needs.  Those who are not ready to embrace</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Gospel, will face the consequences.  Whatever happens,
GOD will provide for those sent (“apostled”).  GOD’s plan will be carried out. 
GOD’s message will be preached.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings I am once again bolstered by
the magnificence of GOD.  GOD makes sure that those who are on the divine
mission will have their needs met.  I again think back on the “Mission Impossible”
show.  Although our mission may</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>meet some of the oppositions and challenges as that of the
IMF (Impossible Mission Force), we have one thing going for us that the IMF did
not have.  The IMF were told that if they fell into enemy hands, those who sent
them would disavow any knowledge of, or connection with, them.  The opposite is
true for those sent to do GOD’s “mission.”  GOD promises to not only
acknowledge those who are on their divinely directed “mission,” but to provide
for them in ways beyond their expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What was true for the twelve “sent out” by Jesus is also
true for us who continue GOD’s “mission.”  We, the modern-day missionaries and
apostles, are to continue the announcement of the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus.
GOD will take care of us when we are doing the work of Jesus and His
Abba-Father.  That is the work we are to do.  If we proclaim the Gospel at all
times, even using words, if necessary, GOD will meet our needs and bestow
blessings on us.  That does not mean we will not meet opposition and rejection
– non-acceptance by other people is part of the deal also.  It may mean we have
to suffer (even in jail) for possibly many years (as did Joseph after being
sold as a slave by his brothers).  Yet, all things will work together for those
who are called by GOD and labor according to GOD’s plan (cf. Romans 8: 28). 
That is GOD’s promise and GOD never disavows the divine promises or those who
seek to do GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There will come a time (maybe not until we are in the
heavenly reign), when we, like Joseph and the psalmist</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>today, can look back and see the providence of GOD in the
events of our lives.  In response to all of this, I can only join the refrain
of the Responsorial today and pray, “Remember the marvels the LORD has done.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I sense the
call of the Lord Jesus to be “sent out” on a “mission”?  To whom am I being
“sent”?  Members of my family?  Co- workers? Friends? People in my worshiping
community? Chance by-standers? How can I better give witness to the GOoD News
by the way I deal with those to whom GOD is “sending” me? How can I support
others who are living out their call to be “apostles” and “missionaries”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and always
providential.  Through Your GOoDness, You have promised to be with and take
care of those who do Your will.  We have sometimes failed to trust in You as we
have faced hard and challenging times.  For those failures to trust You, we
seek Your pardon and forgiveness. You have “sent” Your Son, Jesus, to live on
this earth.  In His earthly existence He met opposition, rejection, and
persecution, yet He relied on Your providence.  Through the further outpouring
of Your Holy Spirit, help us to learn from our Master-Teacher and trust completely
in Your loving care for us.  May we fulfill the “mission” on which You “send”
us – to announce Your message to those whom You have entrusted to us.  May we
always give You thanks and praise as we remember the marvels You have done, not
just in ancient times, but in our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lives today.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son,
Jesus, our Brother and Savior, our Master-Teacher and Lord, our Goel
(Redeemer), Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 46: 1-7, 28-30;        Psalm 37: 3-4,
18-19, 27-29, 39-40;        Matthew 10: 16-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is seen as in control of everything, even though events
happen that are opposed to how mortals often see the plan of GOD.  In the First
Reading Jacob/Israel leaves the land that was promised to his grandfather
(Abraham) and his father (Isaac).  The psalm reminds us that the salvation
comes from the hand of GOD.  In the Gospel, the dismissal of the Apostles on
their missionary journeys includes a prediction of opposition and even
persecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It must have been hard for Jacob/Israel to leave the land
that he knew GOD had given to his ancestors.  GOD reassures him that his son
Joseph would bring his remains back to his homeland and that part of the divine
plan includes the family of Israel going down to Egypt where they will become a
great nation.  Thus, Jacob and his family of almost 70 children and
grandchildren travel to Egypt to be re-united with Joseph and begin a new
episode in their journey of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist urges trust in the LORD and a response of a
righteous lifestyle so GOD could fulfill the promise of land and a great
nation.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is only by trusting in GOD and GOD’s ways that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s plan will be revealed in its fullness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus sends out (apostelein) His apostles to
begin their ministry in His name.  Jesus forecasts that they will meet
resistence even to the point of losing their life as witnesses (martyroi) to
the GOoD News.  To reassure His apostles that they can do what He is asking
them to do, Jesus promises that the Holy Spirit will give them the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>words to speak at the appropriate time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I can only imagine what
thoughts must have raced through the mind of Jacob and also the minds of the
apostles.  Jacob has mixed feelings about leaving the land that is part of his
heritage from his father and grandfather.  How will GOD restore Jacob/Israel to
the land if they are heading out to Egypt for a length of time that only GOD
knows? It would be a blessing to see his son, Joseph, whom he thought was dead.
Yet, he is also conscious of the fact that he is supposed to be buried in the
tomb of Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Rebecca.  Thus, GOD speaks to Jacob/Israel confidently
urging him to have faith in the GOD of promises and promises of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the apostles also must be a bit confused.  As
fishers, tax-collector, and other workers they are not trained to be
motivational speakers.  That, in and of itself, would be hard.  Added to that,
Jesus speaks about the abuse that they should expect to encounter as they
proclaimed the GOoD News.  How will they ever be able to know what to say,
especially to their strongest and wisest opponents and most negative critics?
Jesus promises that the “Spirit of your Father” (the Holy Spirit) will give
them the words to speak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is a GOD of promises – and not false or empty promises. 
GOD is in control and asks only trust and faith on our part.  Like Jacob/Israel
and the apostles, I sometimes wonder how GOD is going to bring about the GOoD
in the seemingly negative situations that I face.  I question if I have placed
myself in a position of being over my head.  Yet, the Lord Jesus seems to say
to me, “Trust me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember hearing the story of a man who sees a great land
across a river.  He begins to cross the river, which, in the beginning, seems
quite calm.  The farther he journeys into the river, the more he is battered
around </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the current.  He prays to GOD for help.  Just about the
time that he is about to give up hope, he spots a rock which is above the
torrent that is now raging around him.  He makes his way to the rock and climbs
up to safety and thanks GOD for being “The Rock” in the midst of the rushing
waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After a period of time, the waters start to rise, and the
man wonders how he is going to get safely out of the new situation.  GOD
responds and sends a “flying carpet” to the man.  The man reluctantly climbs on
the carpet. As the carpet flaps in the wind, the man jumps back on the rock. 
GOD’s voice asks the man, “Don’t you trust me?  Get on the carpet.  I will
protect you.”  The man cautiously climbs onto the carpet again.  As he does so,
the carpet starts to travel across the waters.  Half-way across the river, the
carpet becomes snagged on a fallen tree branch.  The man becomes even more
terrified as he is almost thrown off the carpet and back into the river.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Trust me,” thunders out in the roar of the river.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man clings to the carpet as it begins to head to the
banks of the river.  As the carpet travels over the crashing waves in the
river, the thread in the carpet, which was snagged on the fallen tree, begins
to unravel.  The carpet begins to become smaller and smaller.  The man is even
more terrified than before.  “Trust me,” is once again heard over the crashing
of the violent river waters.  Finally, the man arrives safely on the shore just
as the last thread of the carpet is unraveled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has promised to take care of us.  It does not mean that
we will always have smooth traveling on, over, and through the turbulent rivers
of life.  We must be open to the prompting of the Lord Jesus and trust in GOD
as we meet opposition and turbulent times.  It is only with faith in GOD that
we will eventually reach the promised land and the house of our Abba-Father Who
happens to be GOD.  As we look back, we will be able to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>see how the Lord Jesus has protected and guided us during
our journey.  We should then, and even now, strongly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>voice the words of today’s Responsorial and say, “The
salvation of the just comes from the LORD.”  It is not because we are just and
act rightly that we receive salvation from GOD.  The salvation that comes from
GOD makes us just, as we trust in GOD and in GOD’s promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I handled
turbulent times in my life when I seemed to have been battered about by the
raging torrents around me?  Have I sensed the presence of GOD inviting me to
trust in the promises the Lord Jesus has made? How can I be supportive of
others who are going through rough times in their lives? Do I sense the
presence of the Holy Spirit giving me the words of GOoD News to speak to
others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever faithful to Your promises. 
Through Your GOoDness, You continually remind us that You are in control.  You
sent Your Son, Jesus, to announce the fulfillment of all Your promises in the
reign where He has gone to prepare a place for us.  As we travel life’s paths,
You continually ask us to trust in You and Your promises.  Yet, when we
encounter rough times and the going gets tough, we waver, and we doubt Your
presence in, and Your control over, our lives.  We seek Your forgiveness for
our lack of trust, and we also seek reassurance so that we can move on
confidently.  To You we lift this prayer of praise and thanks for always
watching out for us and guiding us along the Way.  We make this prayer in the
name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, our Master-Teacher and Lord,
the Way to You.  It is He Who has gone before us, to lead us and to prepare a
place for us, for He is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints John Jones and John Wall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saints-john-jones-and-john-wall</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 49: 29-32; 50: 15-26a;       Psalm 105:
1-2, 3-4, 6-7;        Matthew 10: 24-33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings speak about knowing who is the Real Authority
in life.  Jacob and Joseph both realize their relationship to their ancestors
and to their GOD.  The psalmist urges praise of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus, as
the Master-Teacher, reminds those whom He is sending (apostelein) that they are
not greater than the One Who is sending them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading is the final verses we will read from
the book of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Genesis.  Jacob/Israel asks that he be buried in the family
plot in the Promised Land.  After Jacob’s death, the brothers of Joseph fear
that Joseph will avenge the harm they did to him.  Joseph directs their
attention away from himself and to the GOD Who completes the divine plan even
in spite of the wrong doings of mortals.  Joseph reassures his brothers that
GOD will continue to fulfill the divine promises and eventually bring the
children of Israel back to the land promised to their ancestors (Abraham and
Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah).  Joseph realizes that GOD is the One Who is the True
Authority in these matters and no one, including himself, is mightier or
greater than GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is an exhortation to praise GOD for all the GOoD
things GOD continues to do for the Chosen People.  GOD’s judgment and plans
will be fulfilled no matter what humans do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His commissioning address to
those whom He is sending (αποστολή - apostle) out.  He reassures the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>apostles that they are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continuing the work of the Master-Teacher.  They are not
greater than the Master- Teacher, but they should</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>strive to imitate Him and His form of ministry.  Jesus
reminds them that they should not worry or feel inadequate since they are worth
more than the birds of the air.  He also tells them that He will stand up for
them in the presence of His Abba-Father if they stand up for the Gospel message
before others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am reminded that I
must be under authority.  Yes, in some areas I may be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>given a certain amount of authority.  I have been an
educator and role model for the students I taught, and I was on the
administration team in the school.  I also have responsibilities in a parish. 
I have been given power to fulfill my duties – to edify (build up) and educate
students in the Truth.  I am also a leader to other members of the church
community.  Yet, I am not the Ultimate Authority.  I must first and foremost be
under the authority and leadership of the Lord Jesus, the true Master-Teacher. 
I can never take a place of more importance in the lives of the people I serve
than the place of importance that belongs to Jesus and His Abba-Father. 
Following Jesus’ example (and the way He related to His Abba), I must always
direct those under me to the Supreme Authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, like Joseph in the First Reading, I must seek not my
own revenge for hurts inflicted on me by others, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should realize that GOD may be using my painful
experiences to bring about the divine plan.  Ultimate judgment is to be placed
in the hands of GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like the apostles, I am to go out and continue to do the
work of the Master-Teacher.  Any worry that distracts me from my “mission” is
not to be the focus of my time and energy.  GOD loves me and cares for me more
than the sparrows.  GOD knows every hair (at least what is left of them) on my
head.  The attention of my thoughts and actions must be on sharing in the
ministry of the One Who sends me to my family, my students, my faith community,
and those whom I encounter.  If I am faithful to the Master-Teacher and remember
that I am doing His work, then I will not fear or worry about what others may
say to me or about me, or even what they may do to me.  I am to exercise the
authority given to me for the edification of those whom I am called to serve.
If I can do that, I will be doing what the psalmist recommends when he says,
“Give thanks to the LORD, invoke GOD’s name; make known among the nations the
divine deeds.  Sing to the LORD, sing GOD’s praise, proclaim all GOD’s wondrous
deeds!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I view
authority (both those who are over me and my authority over others)? What is my
attitude when I am placed in a role of authority?  How would I enjoy being
under my own authority?  Am I serving others and helping them know the Truth?
Do I pray for those in authority over me (cf. 1 Timothy 2: 1-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2) and also for those over whom I exercise authority?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Ultimate Source of all
Authority.  Through Your GOoDness, You empower others with authority, not for
the purpose of “lording” over those under them, but for the purpose of leading
people to You.  Your Son came in perfect obedience and taught with the
authority that attracted respect and awe, unlike the authority of some of the
religious leaders of His day.  As He ministered to people, He always directed
them to You, His Abba, and the focus of His attention.  Knowing that in His
earthly travels He would not be able to reach all peoples, Jesus empowered
others to continue His work and to minister with His authority.  He promised
that You would take care of all who serve and minister in Jesus’ name.  We
thank You for those who have touched our lives because they used Your authority
over us to edify us and educate us in the Way of Your Son.  We also thank You
for empowering us with authority to proclaim the GOoD News of Your Son to those
whom You have entrusted to our care.  May we always give Your thanks and praise
and sing Your glory in and through Your Son, our Master-Teacher, Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fifteenth Sunday in Ordinary Time Readings can be obtained
from:  http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/071325.cfm Saint Henry: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-henry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Deuteronomy 30: 10-14;     Psalm 69: 14, 17,
30-31, 33-34, 36, 37; Colossians 1: 15-20;           Luke 10: 25-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We see an apparent dichotomy between the awesome
mysteriousness of GOD and the call to “know” what GOD wants for us. The First
Reading reminds us that even though GOD is almighty and totally other, GOD can
be “known” from what GOD has revealed and commanded. The Responsorial urges us
to simply turn to the LORD GOD and we will live. St. Paul, in his Letter to the
Colossians, presents Jesus as the visible and knowable image of the invisible
GOD. In the Gospel, Jesus is asked about who can be defined as the neighbor whom
we are called to love as much as we love ourselves. In sharing the familiar
parable of the GOoD Samaritan, He informs His questioner (and us) that
everyone, even our enemy, is our neighbor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Book of Deuteronomy is literally the book of the “Second
Law.” In the verses of this book are a long list of do’s and don’ts. The Hebrew
people were probably overwhelmed with the volume (613) of precepts that dealt
with living out their covenant relationship with their GOD. We, like them,
often wonder about how can we follow all the laws (civil, religious, social) so
that we can have our names written in the Book of Life. Also, like our
ancestors in faith, we wonder Who GOD is and how we can come to know the One
Who is so totally awesome, almighty, and mysterious. Moses informs the faithful
(both of old and of today) that the key commandment of GOD is quite simple and
so is the GOD Who requires obedience. It boils down to – relationship. Those
who want to know what GOD asks of them must be in GOoD relationship with GOD,
GOoD relationship with others, and GOoD relationship with themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist begins today’s Responsorial with a prayer of
petition, asking for GOD’s help during a time of crisis. Relying on the great
kindness of the LORD, the psalmist urges not only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>himself, but all those who need GOD’s help, to trust in the
promises GOD has made to take care of those who have been called by GOD. It is
in turning to the LORD in times of troubles that GOD will answer and respond.
It is in the expression of one’s relationship with GOD that the LORD
demonstrates what relationship is all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Reading seems to be a liturgical hymn that St.
Paul shares with the people of Colossae. In it, Jesus’ role in both creation
and salvation is expressed. Jesus is the visible (tangible, experiential) image
of the GOD Who is invisible (intangible, totally beyond our experience). Jesus
was with His Abba-Father from before, and throughout, the process of creation.
And Jesus made the re-creation of the world possible through His human
existence, ministry, death, and resurrection. It is thus that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is head of the Church, His Body, since He (in His
physical body) has reconciled all creation and re-established the relationship
with the Almighty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is “tested” by a Jewish legal expert.
He is questioned about what is necessary for eternal life. Jesus, in turn,
throws back the question to His questioner, “What is written in the law? How do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>you read it?” The learned scribe responds with the great
commandments of loving GOD with all one’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>being and loving one’s neighbor as oneself. After Jesus
affirms the summary of all the laws, the tester tries to get Jesus to respond
in a way that will be evidence against Him by asking, “Who is my neighbor?”
Jesus presents the parable of the GOoD Samaritan in which those who should have
been neighborly are not, while one who is considered to be an “enemy” is the
true neighbor to the one who falls victim to abuse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am struck by the breadth of
topics presented, especially in the Second Reading. There is so much on which I
could ponder that my reflection could take up many pages. Yet there is also a
simplicity in the message throughout all the readings. It all focuses on
relationships – relationship with GOD, and relationship with </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others, and relationship to self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has gifted humans with ability to think and rationalize,
that is, GOD has given us the ability to “know.” Yet in our cogitations, we
have often overly thought and made mountains out of simple molehills. This is
particularly true in our “theologizing” and “moralizing.” We have tried to
explain Who GOD is and what GOD demands of us. We have argued on both sides of
many theological and ethical issues. Yet we have failed to do what GOD desire
us to do – be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in relationship with the Lord Jesus and be in relationship
with all those who are loved by GOD, that is, everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth about the Almighty and Omnipotent GOD is simple.
GOD is love. GOD is relationship. The one, true GOD is a love relationship
between three persons and that love, that flows between Abba-Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit, is so pervasive and powerful that it spills out into creation. GOD
wants to share that love relationship with others, so GOD has created and
continues to create life. Creation reaches a climax in the life that is able to
consciously relate back to the Creator. Yet, in giving humans the ability to
“know,” GOD also gave us the ability to reject “knowledge.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded that in the Bible, the concept of “knowing” is
much more than an intellectual activity. To “know” means to “be in
relationship.” For example, in Luke 1: 34, when the angel Gabriel explains to
Mary that she has been chosen to be the mother of the Savior, Mary responds,
“How can this be, since I do not ‘know’ man?” She has not had sexual relations
with Joseph or any other man. This expression of knowledge is used throughout
scripture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What GOD wants is for me to “know” the Triune Deity. I am
called to be in relationship with the GOD Who has revealed the divine essence
through various means: creation, scripture, and most importantly, the
incarnation of GOD (Jesus). Yet “knowing” GOD cannot be just a vertical and
intellectual relationship between myself and the GOD Who is above. It must
reach out horizontally – to others. As I develop in my “knowledge” of GOD, I
realize that if I am loved by the GOD (Who is my Abba, my brother Jesus, my
Helper Spirit), then I am also called to “know” and be in relationship with all
those who are loved into existence by GOD. I am called to love those whom my
GOD has deemed loveable by giving them life. How can I refuse to love those who
are in relationship with GOD (whether or not they “know” GOD as their creator
and redeemer). By the very fact that they have life, they are in relationship
with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For if GOD refused to relate to them in love, they would no
longer be. Thus, I must seek to know and love them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, I show my “knowledge” of GOD and GOD’s directives for
me by my loving GOD and loving others. I demonstrate my relationship with GOD
by having GOoD relationships with those whom GOD holds in existence. It is in
my experience of being loved and loving others that I “know” more about the GOD
Who is love. While it may be difficult to put into practice, in reality it is
as simple as that. Or to put it in the words of today’s Responsorial: “Turn to
the LORD in your need, and you will live (and love and be loved).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I contemplate
the mystery of GOD do I struggle to understand and solve the mystery or am I
content to just live the awesomeness of the mystery of love?  How have I
experienced the “knowledge” of GOD?  What can I do to share this “knowledge”
with others? Who is most in need of my loving today? This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, totally beyond and yet ever so
close. Through Your GOoDness, You have revealed Who You are by Your acts of
loving us into earthly existence. Even though we have refused at times to grow
in our “knowledge” of You, You have continued to send us reminders of Who You
are – the GOD Who is Love. In the fullness of time, You allowed Your Son to
share our humanity so that we could better “know” You through His loving life,
ministry, death, and resurrection. To continue this process of relating to You,
You and Your Son have allowed us to experience the presence of Your Holy Spirit
in our lives, giving us the gifts of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, and
equipping us with the ability to not only “know” but to share this knowledge
with others in and through love. May You continue to kindle in us the fire of
Your love so that we can help others experience the flame</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Your love and develop an even more close relationship
with You. To You we give all praise, glory, honor, and thanks as we relate to You,
our GOD, and experience and share in Your love, for You are Love itself, as You
live in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the fullness of life as Abba-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Exodus 1: 8-14, 22;        Psalm 124: 1b-3, 4-6,
7-8;        Matthew 10: 34-11: 1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Difficult times are part of life, especially the life of
those who are GOD’s Chosen People.  The Book of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exodus begins with describing the increasing problems for
the children (grandchildren and great grandchildren</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and descendants) of Jacob/Israel.  The psalm directs the
attention to the LORD as the source of help for those who are going through
tough situations.  In the Gospel, Jesus describes the life of His disciples as
one that will include rejection, suffering, and the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading sets the scene for the Book of Exodus that
will be used as the First Reading for the next few weeks (except when a major
Memorial or Feast as celebrated with special readings).  Joseph has died, a new
dynasty has come to power in Egypt.  This new dynasty does not value the work
of Joseph and is afraid that his descendants and those of his brothers will
overtake the new government.  Thus, the children (descendants) of Israel are
forced into slavery.  Any boy born to Israelite family is to be killed by being
drowned in the river.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm speaks encouraging words that GOD is with those
who are oppressed and will lead them out of their oppression into a new
freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel reminds us that following the Lord Jesus is not
always a garden of roses, unless you remember that roses have thorns (my
analogy). Being a prophet (one who speaks the Word of GOD) and being righteous
(acting according to GOD’s plan) can, and often does, put us in opposition to
those who seek the ways of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, Jesus promises us, if we seek to serve others (even
doing as simple a task as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>giving a cup of cold water), we can expect to be rewarded,
yet that should not be the reason we do the kind deed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It would be nice to live in utopia (a word that means “not a
[real] place”) – a world where everyone always got along with each other, and
things were peaceful and happy.  Yet, this earthly world is not that way.  Part
of what makes the world imperfect is that we are created with free will and we
can choose the easy and selfish way of doing what seems best just “for me.” 
GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>challenges us to seek a way of service and doing “for
others.”  When we follow the plan of the Lord Jesus, we can expect to face
opposition, ridicule, and outright rejection.  Jesus knows this from personal
experience.  His ministry of loving service led Him to the cross – the end of
His earthly human life.  Today, Jesus predicts that we, too, are headed for the
cross, although it may take a slightly different form than the cross of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being the GOoD guys puts us at odds with those who seek only
what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>serves themselves.  The descendants of Israel realize this. 
They are GOD’s chosen people.  Yet, when new leadership comes on the scene,
seeing the increasing number of the Israelites and fearing losing the power
that they only recently acquired, they decide to oppress the children of
Israel.  Even after the new pharaoh’s repeated steps to decrease the power and
number of the Israelites, GOD is still blessing them with increasing number –
and eventually (as we shall see in the days ahead) freedom and a return to the
Promise Land. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My response to all of this is to realize that my journey of
faith will not always be smooth and pleasant (not that it has been that way
throughout my life so far).  I should expect to face challenging times.  I must
keep my eyes fixed on the Master-Teacher and doing the will of His
Abba-Father.  By myself, I will not succeed.  It is only with the help and
guidance of the Holy Spirit that I will be able to keep on going – to my cross
and eventually to my rising from the grave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During one of the Amazing Encounter retreats over the last
few years, one of the talks was given by a then</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>college student.  Throughout high school and her first years
in college, she had been involved in various forms of community service.  Many
people complimented her on her kind acts toward others.  Being praised by
others and receiving acknowledgment for charitable acts became the driving
force behind her charitable acts.  She sought the attention that humanitarian
acts brought her.  She gave the impression that she was concerned for those
whom</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>she served, but she performed her acts of kindness for the
glory it brought her.  In May of that year, she went to Rwanda on a missionary
service program associated with the Christian college she attended.  She met a
six-year- old girl who transformed her attitude from seeking glory for her kind
deeds to one of service of the little ones. She realized that what Jesus spoke
about in today’s Gospel was the need to serve others, not to be rewarded, but
because they were GOD’s little ones who needed to be loved for who they are. 
This young lady has been transformed as she understands what the life of a
disciple of the Lord Jesus is all about:  it is not about oneself and being
praised by others, but it is about serving others, even if others mock the
service that is performed for the little ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What hardships have
I endured that have made me question my relationships with the Lord Jesus?  How
has GOD revealed the divine, loving presence to me, to strengthen me in the
midst of my problems? What is the motive for my reaching out to others? Is it
merely to be seen as a “nice” person, or is it to minister to those who need my
care, no matter what the personal cost is to me? How can I be a source of
reassurance to others who are journeying through trying times in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all peoples and all times. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have called individuals to come to You and
experience Your blessings even in the midst of the trying and difficult events
in their lives.  You promise to bring help to those who follow Your ways and
the ways of Your Son.  We have sometimes failed to see Your help when we have
had to face situations that seemed humanly hopeless.  We have also failed to
see and assist those who are going through hard times, because we have been
focused on ourselves.  Through the ministry, suffering, death on the cross, and
resurrection of Your Son, Jesus, You have shown us that our journey to You does
have its painful and sorrowful moments, but that there is a glorious life ahead. 
Through the continued outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, direct our eyes to seeing
the full picture You have in mind – eternal life with You.  Give us the
strength to minister to the little ones who need our caring, not because we
receive praise of others, but because we are following the example of Your Son
Who came to serve and not be served.  We continue to praise and thank You for
fulfilling all Your promises in and through Your Son, our Master-Teacher, Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Bonaventure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Tue. of the 15th Week in Ord. Time)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Bonaventure:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-bonaventure</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 2: 1-15a;        Psalm 69: 3,4, 30-31,
33-34b;         Matthew 11: 20-24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is just.  GOD makes sure that the divine plan is brought
about.  Today’s First Reading from Exodus tells of the birth and raising of
Moses and his adoption by the daughter of the Pharaoh, and his later killing of
an Egyptian who was inflicting pain upon an Israelite (a Hebrew).  The
Responsorial Psalm plays on the images of being drawn out of the water (as
Moses was) and GOD hearing the prayer of the one who called upon the name</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus condemns the people of
the towns where miracles were done but where people did not believe in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the children (descendants) of Jacob/Israel are subjected
to more restriction, they are told that any male child born was to be killed. 
The mother of one Israelite cannot bear to see her baby boy slain.  Thus, she
puts the boy in a wicker basket and has the basket float on the Nile River near
the place where the daughter of the Pharaoh bathes.  The princess feels sorry
(is “moved with pity”) for the infant and decides to spare the baby’s life. 
Unbeknown to the princess, the child’s own mother is the one chosen to care for
the child until the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>boy is weaned.  The princess calls the boy Moses.  There are
two play-on-words for the name.  The Egyptian name “Moses” means “one who is
born”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presumably of divine power.  The Hebrew name for the
Egyptian Moses is “Mosheh” and the nearest Hebrew word is mashah meaning “draw
out.” Moses is then raised in the royal palace and enjoys life as member of the
royal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>family.  Obviously, he also realizes his birth parents are
Hebrew (Israelite).  Later in his life (possibly when he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>was 40 or so), he sees the mistreatment of an Israelite by
an Egyptian.  This enrages Moses so much that he kills the Egyptian, hoping
that it would be the end of the event.  Yet, his killing is not as unseen as he
had hoped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word spreads about his action not only among the Israelites
but also among the Egyptians.  This leads to Moses’ leaving the land of Egypt
to go to Midian, where (as we will hear in readings later this week) GOD will
call Moses into deeper relationship and special ministry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up on two key aspects of the early life of
Moses:  his being saved from the water and the prayer that was offered that GOD
would take care of those who were in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus’ ministry to the people living in the
towns around the Sea of Galilee seems to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have been less effective than Jesus would have liked.
Because of the lack of faith, Jesus warns that the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people of Chorazin (Korazim), Bethsaida, and Capernaum will
be held more accountable for not accepting the GOoD News than the pagan towns
of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom (cities known for the sinful ways).  Interestingly,
the towns of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum are all destroyed within a few
generations after the death of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I realize that GOD’s
plan may be sidetracked by human action, but GOD has a way of bringing about
the plan in spite of the doings (or more accurate, wrong-doings) of mortals. 
It seems to me that GOD often uses the worst scenarios to show the awesomeness
of the divine </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>power and plan.  As the Israelites were enslaved by the
newly established Egyptian dynasty, it seemed almost impossible that a leader
would arise after the law imposing the death of male children of the
Israelites.  Yet GOD heard the cry of the Chosen People and through the
miraculous events of putting a baby into a basket in the Nile River, GOD raised
up a leader who would be educated at the royal courts.  It is interesting to me
that Moses was saved through the waters of the Nile Rivers, just as he would lead
his people through the waters of the sea years later at the time of the
Exodus.  Also, Moses, the son of an Israelite couple, is adopted as a son of
the royal princess.  Later Moses would lead the Israelites to freedom after the
sons of the Egyptians are killed in the tenth plague.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel is challenging to me.  I realize that since I
have come to know the Lord Jesus through His teachings and ministry, I will be
held accountable for believing (or failing to believe) in Him.  I am reminded
that to those who have been given more, more will be expected.  The challenge
put in the form of a question is:  “Am I living up to the gifts that I have
been given?”  I will have to answer to GOD for the way I live out the faith I
have been given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD can bring the GOoD News to people without me.  But GOD
has chosen to use me (and all believers) and GOD has gifted me (and all
believers) with knowledge and faith.  In response to the gifts, we should want
to do as much as we can to bring the Gospel to others.  The response we should
have is that of the psalmist today: “I will praise the name of GOD in song; and
I will glorify GOD with thanksgiving.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How have I
experienced GOD’s answering of my prayers when I have called upon the Lord
Jesus in times of difficulties?  What gifts have I been given by GOD and how
have I used those gifts in spreading the GOoD News (Gospel)?  What can I do to
help others experience the presence of GOD in their lives, particularly when
they are faced with problems?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Divine Provider and all-knowing
Divine Being.  Through Your GOoDness, You have blessed Your people with a
relationship with You.  You have revealed Yourself to us even when we have
worked against Your plan.  In the most dire of situations, You have made Your
presence felt by those who sincerely called upon You.  In the course of time –
Your time – You have brought about the salus (healing, salvation, wholeness) of
Your people – in the Exodus during the time of Moses, but more importantly in
the ministry, suffering, death, and resurrection of Your Son and His sending
the Holy Spirit.  We praise You for gifting us with this revelation.  We ask
that Your Holy Spirit continue to open our minds to Your wonders, so</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we may always accept the gift of faith.  Empower us to
go out as Your witnesses – to proclaim the message</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of salvation.  We make this prayer of praise and
thanksgiving in the name of Your Son, Jesus, the Redeemer Whom You sent to us,
the Master-Teacher Who continues to instruct us, and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/our-lady-of-mount-carmel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 3: 1-6, 9-12;       Psalm 103: 1b-2, 3-4,
6-7;        Matthew 11: 25-27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD not only creates and provides for humanity, but also GOD
reveals the essence of Who GOD is to those who respond to the gifts that GOD
offers.  In today’s First Reading, Moses is the recipient of GOD’s self-
revelation.  With that revelation comes an obligation.  The psalm echoes the
fact that GOD has been revealed to Moses.  Jesus, in the Gospel, reassures His
followers that if they are simple and willing to accept GOD, GOD will continue
to be self-revealing, especially in and through Jesus, the Son of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s reading from Exodus takes place after Moses has fled
Egypt, has married a wife, and seems complacent to live out his life in the
desert.  GOD appears in a burning bush.  GOD calls the place “holy” because GOD
is being revealed there.  Moses is told to take off his sandals because it is
“holy” ground.  After experiencing the manifestation of GOD in the burning
bush, Moses is commanded to return to Egypt and set free GOD’s people (the
children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob/Israel). Obviously, Moses is not too
excited to return to the land where neither any Egyptian nor any Israelite
trusts him, since he is a murderer.  As we shall see in the days ahead, Moses
has to be convinced to live out the implications of GOD’s revelation to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist proclaims the GOoDness and kindness of GOD.
Part of that is seen in the revelation given to Moses that led to GOD’s setting
the Chosen People free from their slavery in Egypt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about the recipients of GOD’s
revelation.  It is not the self-righteous and arrogant who will receive the
revelation of GOD.  It is the simple and humble.  The greatest self-revelation
of GOD is in and through Jesus.  The mighty and sophisticated</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cannot accept that GOD would become human and live on
earth.  Their understanding of the Almighty would not allow for the Omnipotent
to be limited to the human condition.  Yet, Jesus is the living proof that GOD
loves humanity enough to share fully in human life, not just as creator, but as
a mortal facing death.  Jesus has come to reveal GOD as His Abba-Father.  All
who accept Jesus, will also accept His Abba</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and they are drawn into a closer relationship with GOD, not
just as creatures</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but as daughters and sons of GOD and sisters and brothers of
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that revelation of
GOD is much more than intellectually comprehending GOD or trying to figure out
the divine plan. Revelation is GOD’s sharing life with us.  First of all, GOD
gives life, but GOD gives life to all animate creatures.  GOD goes even further
with mortal human beings, men and women.  GOD wants humans to have a
relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the divine.  Yet, being finite in nature, we cannot
fully understand that.  And being sinful, we are not worthy to accept that. 
That is why in the fullness of time, GOD allowed GOD the Son to become fully
human – to walk in our sandals, to be like us in all things but sin.  In Jesus’
sharing in our humanity, He is able to communicate and demonstrate GOD’s love
in a way unbeknownst to humans before this.  Jesus reveals GOD as a loving Abba
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who is willing to give the very best to others.  But Jesus
revelation of Who GOD is does not stop there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus tells us that we can become daughters and sons of His
Abba, and His own sisters and brothers.  All we need do is accept (not
necessarily fully understand) what is being revealed to us.  This lifts us up
to the divine level.  We are empowered to become part of the family of GOD and
to have a share in the very divine life of GOD.  What that fully means, we
cannot even begin to imagine in our limited earthly state.  Yet that is the
essence of Who GOD is – that is the essence of GOD’s self-revelation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, this is only a glimpse of what GOD wants us to
experience, just as the burning bush was only the first of many first-hand
experiences of what GOD was going to do for and through Moses.  The more we
take the time to meditate on this and allow ourselves to be a part of this
divine revelation, the more we will come to know the majesty and wonder of
GOD.  And we will have all eternity to continue to deepen our experience and
appreciation of GOD’s self-revelation.  Thus, our response should be that of
the psalmist today:  “Bless the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD, O my soul; and all my being, bless GOD’s holy name;
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forgot not all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s benefits.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Have I taken the
time to reflect on how GOD continues to reveal to me the essence of Who GOD
is?  How have I experienced this revelation by GOD? Has this allowed me to
develop a deeper personal relationship with GOD?  What can I do to pass on this
“knowledge” of GOD to others without sounding “preachy”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all creation.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have created the universe out of love.  As the crown of Your
creation, You have breathed Your very life/Spirit (Ruah) into humans and made</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them in Your own divine image.  Yet that was not the end of
Your dealings with mortals.  You allowed them to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>freely choose to follow You, or freely choose to sin against
You.  Even after sin entered the world (and repeatedly at that), You did not
abandon mortals to a life devoid of You through sinfulness, but You offered
hope and forgiveness through Your on-going self-revelation.  In the fullness of
time You sent Your only Son to continue the revelation of Your love and
forgiveness through His life, ministry, death, and resurrection.  He came to
reveal You as a loving Abba and a GOD Who wants to have a personal and eternal relationship
with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humans.  Through His teaching and life, Jesus invited us
into an existence in which we share in Your divine life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For this we bless You and thank You with all our being. 
Help us to never forget Your benefits, but praise You, in and through Your Son,
for He is the fullest revelation of Your being, For He is One with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 3: 13-20;         Psalm 105: 1 and 5, 8-9,
24-25, 26-27;         Matthew 11: 28-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is always concerned for the people who are in
relationship with the LORD.  GOD realizes when people are in need of divine
help.  In the First Reading, GOD, speaking from the burning bush, informs Moses
that the Chosen People will be set free from their slavery and will be led to
the Promised Land.  The psalm reassures us that GOD remembers the divine
covenant and will keep the divine promises.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks
comforting and inviting words to His disciples, especially those who find
themselves worn out and burdened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As GOD tells Moses about the divine plan to free the Hebrew
(Israelite) people from their forced servitude to the Egyptians, GOD also
reveals the divine name, YHWH.  This name has been translated as “I Am Who Am”
or simply “I Am.”  The name implies existence and presence.  GOD always has
been and always will be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is particularly present with those who are connected</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD and those who are going through hard times. The
LORD reveals not only the essence (the being) of Who GOD is, but GOD also
forecasts the divine plan that includes that Moses be insistent that the People
of GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be released from the slavery to the Egyptians.  Also made</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>known to Moses is the opposition Moses and the Hebrew people
will encounter from pharaoh and the Egyptians. Yet, GOD promises to use mighty
and wondrous signs to bring about the freedom of the Israelites and their
eventual entrance into the land flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[The four Hebrew consonants YHWH is the name for GOD. 
Exactly how that is pronounced is a matter of discussion, because even when
Hebrew started to be written with vowels, the name YHWH was never pronounced.
When coming to the name YHWH, the Hebrews would substitute the word Adonai
which is translated as “The Lord” or “The LORD.” To this day, devote Jews never
vocalize the proper name for GOD and, in fact, many even spell the English
word, GOD as G_D. It would be GOoD if we had the same respect for the holy name
for GOD.  The first consonant can be a Y or J.  The third consonant can be a W
or V.  Using different vowels, some of the variations on the spelling of this
holy name of GOD are YaHWeH and  JeHoVaH.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Catholic Church, in respect for the proper and holy name
of GOD, have decreed that we do not use the name</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>YHWH in songs and in readings, but to substitute the title
“The LORD.”]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist urges praise of GOD because of all the
marvelous deeds the LORD does for the Chosen People.  GOD is to be given glory
for fulfilling the promises made to Abraham, promises particularly brought
about by the Exodus experience.  Moses (and Aaron) are instruments whom GOD
chooses to bring about the covenant made with Abraham and his descendants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Jesus speaks to His disciples (disciplined
learners).  Jesus invites His followers to come to Him and learn from Him. 
Learning from Jesus will lighten the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>burdens and refresh those who are carrying a heavy load. 
Two of the things to be learned from Jesus are how to be 1) meek and 2) humble of
heart.  If His disciples faithfully learn the lessons that Jesus presents,
their journey along the way of faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will be lightened, because Jesus Himself will help shoulder
some (in fact, most) of the load. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am relieved.  I know that we
are not to slide through life without work.  St. Paul reminds us that “those
who do not work, should not eat” (2 Thessalonians 3: 10).  So, we must do what
we are called to do and do it the best we can.  In Galatians 6: 1-5, Paul
commands that we each carry our load, but also, he urges us to help bear each
other’s burdens.  The problem some people have is that they sometimes overload
themselves or are overloaded by others.  GOD does not want us to be so over
burdened that we are not able to enjoy the “GOD Who Is.”  When we become so
overwhelmed with worries and work, we miss the GOD Who Is and the GOD Who Is
with us.  We do not spend the time with GOD Who promises to lighten our load
and bring us to the Promised Land – the Eternal Promised Land of Heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lesson that I must learn is to allow myself to come to
the Lord Jesus and be a faith-full disciplined learner (disciple).  I must come
sit at the feet of the Master-Teacher and become His apprentice, especially in
the ways in which He is meek and humble of heart.  For Jesus, being meek and
humble of heart means that He knows His relationship with His Abba and He knows
that spending quiet, restful moments with His Abba is what refreshes Him.  He
also knows how He must reach out to others.  The only way I can learn that is
by spending time with the Master-Teacher.  I must be willing to be in the
presence of the “Great I Am.”  In that way, I will be yoked with the One Who Is
– the One Who Can Be what I truly need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I
experience the “GOD Who Is”? What burdens prevent me from being able to come to
the Lord Jesus and receive the rest and renewal that GOD promises?  What can I
do to remind people that the Lord Jesus wants to be yoked with them to lighten
their loads?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all creation.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have not only revealed Your love for us through the Exodus event,
but You revealed part of Your essence in giving us Your name, YHWH. You
continue to show Your concern for us by sending us Your Son, Who invites us to
come to Him and learn</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from Him, especially when we find ourselves burdened and
overwhelmed.  May we take the time to sit at His feet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and appreciate His shouldering our loads so that we can come
to know You and Him more fully as the “GOD Who Is” – Who Is with us.  We lift
up this prayer of praise to You in and through Your Son, Jesus, our Master-
Teacher and Savior, Who takes the greater part of the yoke with which we are
joined to Him.  He is the One Who Is the Savior of the world, and One Who Is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Mary MacKillop:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-mary-mackillop</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 12: 37-42;        Psalm 136: 1 and 23-24,
10-12, 13-15;         Matthew 12: 14-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings present some of the characteristics of GOD. 
GOD is seen in the First Reading as fulfilling the promises made to the
ancestors of the Israelites.  The psalm retells the Exodus story with the
repeating refrain: “GOD’s mercy endures forever.”  In the Gospel, Jesus
embodies the characteristics that Isaiah attributed to the Suffering Servant of
the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading continues the story of the first Exodus.
The Israelites (Hebrews and those married to Hebrews)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leave Egypt.  The view portrayed here is that of a hasty
exit</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(no time to let the leaven work into bread dough and rise).
It is also seen as the climax of the story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob-Israel, and
Joseph – their descendants are finally leaving Egypt to journey to the land
that had been promised to them.  This event is so significant in Hebrew history
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it is commemorated each year as the Feast of Passover.  It
celebrates the freedom GOD bestowed on the Chosen People and the fulfillment of
GOD’s promises to give the Israelites their own land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of thanksgiving to GOD for setting the
Chosen People free from their slavery by allowing them to pass through the sea
that only moments later drowned the Egyptian army.  The repeating refrain
summarizes Who GOD is:  GOD is continually merciful (“[GOD’s] mercy endures
forever”).  Two aspects are presented:  GOD’s mercy (loving kindness -
[c]hesed) and GOD’s everlasting faithfulness (emet[h]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel presents Jesus’ response to the plots against
Him.  He continues</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His ministry, but not in Jerusalem where His antagonists
are.  Another</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>important part of today’s reading shows Jesus as the
fulfillment of the Suffering</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Servant verses in the Book of Isaiah.  Jesus has come as the
Chosen Servant of GOD.  He is filled with GOD’s Spirit.  He is humble, gentle,
and caring.  And He brings hope not only to the Chosen People but to the
Gentiles (that is to all peoples).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What struck me about the readings today were the qualities
of GOD:  merciful, faithful, humble, gentle, and caring.  Obviously, the Lord
Jesus is the par excellence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of all virtues, but the characteristics mentioned today are
particularly important.  And, as a disciple of the Lord Jesus, these are
attributes that I should strive to imitate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In regard to being merciful, I must examine how I treat
others, particularly those who have aggravated me or who have been a cause of
irritation.  If I recall how sin is an affront to GOD and yet how GOD has been
willing to forgive not just the sins of past generations,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but also my sins, I begin to realize how merciful GOD is. 
GOD’s love for me is more powerful than my sinfulness.  Jesus has been willing
to be born, to live on earth, to die and to rise for me and my sins.  And when
I sin again, the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father are willing to be merciful
again and again and again.  Obviously, I should not go out and sin just so that
the Lord Jesus can be merciful to me.  I should not presume on the divine
mercy.  If GOD can be so merciful to me, a sinner, how much mercy should I show
to those who just get on my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>nerves or act in ways that annoy me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I think how GOD is faithful (consistently doing what is
expected and has been promised), I know I fall quite short in being faithful. 
I make promises to others and to GOD, but I do not always live out my
commitments.  Being a disciple of the Lord Jesus means I must constantly do the
GOoD I have said I will do.  I must also trust others and expect them to do
what they have committed themselves to do.  And most importantly, I must be faithful
– full of faith and trust – in my relationship with GOD.  This means spending
time and energy in trying to enhance and develop that relationship with GOD and
with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we heard in the Gospel a few days ago [on Thursday of
this week], Jesus is gentle and humble of heart, and He invites us to come and
learn from Him.  Gentle and humble is not the false denial of who we are.  On
the contrary, being humble means knowing who I am and honestly living and
acting in a way that demonstrates my GOD-given potential.  It means treating
others in a way that respects them as children of GOD, and inviting them into a
closer relationship with GOD, just as Jesus did.  Being humble also includes
being able to give GOD all the glory and praise that is due for GOD’s empowerment
of me to live out my full potential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lord Jesus continually manifested caring (compassion,
love) for others.  Compassion (“suffering with”) should make me strive to sense
what other people truly need and seek to do all which GOD enables me to do to
meet those needs.  That means I must be sensitive to others.  I must also be
willing to share the Truth with them in a way that, even though challenging to
me, will be inviting to them and make them want to draw closer to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD Whom I serve.  Thus, this quality demands that I think
of others and seek their ultimate GOoD, even if they may not like what that
means for their lives.  I must present them with the GOoD options in a way that
does not come across that I am “holier than they.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a disciple (a disciplined learner and follower) of the
Lord Jesus, means I should strive to imitate my Master-Teacher and bring the
GOoD News of salvation to them, not for my own glory and pleasure, but for the
greater glory and honor of GOD.  To help me stayed focused, I need to keep
repeating the phrase that was used many times in today’s psalm:  “For [GOD’s]
mercy endures forever.”  I must not just mouth the words but reflect its
meaning in my relationship with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How have I
experienced the steadfast mercy of GOD? How do I reflect GOD’s mercy and
faithfulness to the people with whom I deal each and every day?   In what ways
can I be a better model of the loving care and compassion that comes from GOD?
Who might benefit from my mirroring GOD’s attributes today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all creation.  Through Your
GOoDness and mercy, that endure for ever, You manifest Who You are.  Through
Your Son, You invite us to participate in Your life and reflect Your qualities
to others.  We seek Your mercy and forgiveness for the times we have not been
models of Your loving care and compassion for others.  Continue to send Your
Holy Spirit upon us that we may be Your servants (“suffering” servants, if
necessary) and others may come to know You and Your Son.  We lift up this
prayer of praise and honor to You in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother
and Savior, Who is our Master-Teacher and Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Apollinaris: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-apollinaris</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Genesis 18: 1-10a;      Psalm 15: 2-3, 3-4,
5;      Colossians 1: 24-28;       Luke 10: 38-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people would see both a connection and an opposition in
the readings for this day.  The connection comes from the theme of hospitality
that is seen in the way that Abraham (and his wife and household) and Martha
respond to their respective visitors.  The opposition seems to be in the
contrasting attitudes of Martha and Mary as one serves and the other sits and
listens.  In his letter to the Colossians, Paul mentions the driving force that
enables him to see his sufferings as ways of serving the Lord Jesus and
proclaiming the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, scripture scholars disagree on whether
Abraham immediately recognized the three visitors as the LORD and two
messengers (angels).  What is important in the reading is how quickly,
completely, and enthusiastically Abraham responded as a hospitable host to his
guests.  First, he invites them to sit in the shade of his terebinth tree (a
welcome relief for travelers who are journeying under the scorching sun).  He
acts like (and I doubt if it is only an act but wholehearted belief) that it
would be an act of kindness to him if the three individuals would enjoy his
cordial reception.  He begins by offering water both for drinking and for
washing of their feet (a welcome relief for sojourners who are traveling on
dusty roads with open sandals on their feet).  He then invites them to partake
of “a little food” that in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reality turns out to be a huge feast with baked goods made
from three seahs (about 75 cups) of flour, a whole steer, plus all the
trimmings.  Some scholars believe that Abraham did not realize fully Who his
guests were until the leader (GOD) predicts that the aged (nearly 90-year-old)
Sarah would give birth to a child within a year (after her impregnation and
gestation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up the theme of the just individual who acts
righteously and therefore enjoys being in the presence of the LORD.  It
emphasizes that the person who is aware of what a relationship with GOD is all
about will in turn act in a hospitable, caring, and just way towards all the
other creatures of GOD.  In doing so, the just person will experience GOD’s
presence more fully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul, in his letter to the faithful in Colossae,
continues to express, and even boast about, what are the signs of his
commitment to proclaiming the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus – his own
sufferings.  He sees his physical torments as separating himself from the other
preachers who are preaching false teachings and possibly gaining fame and
fortune from their preaching.  His misfortunes show that he is one with his
Lord Jesus, Who Himself suffered and died for the sake of the GOoD News. 
Scripture scholars agree that Paul’s words about “what is lacking in the
suffering of Christ” do not imply</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that Jesus did not do enough to save us.  Paul seems to be
saying that his sufferings demonstrate Paul’s own living out and demonstrating
that Jesus’ suffering was the means of salvation, and that the paschal mystery
came from Jesus’ death and resurrection, not just His resurrection.  Paul may
be saying, as was believed at the time, that the disciples of the Lord Jesus
would have to endure a certain amount of suffering before Jesus returned at the
end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel pericope is the familiar passage of Jesus’ being
a guest at the home of Mary and Martha (in Bethany).  The two sisters have
different responses to the presence of their Lord Jesus.  Martha, following the
pattern of Sarah and Abraham in the First Reading, busies herself with the
actions of hospitality.  She races around preparing all that is necessary and
fitting for dinner celebration with such an honorable guest as Jesus.  Mary, on
her part, takes a position of a disciple, sitting at the feet of Jesus,
listening to His every word. This action by a woman of the first century would
have been unheard of in the Middle Eastern society of that day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both women seek to do what they think is appropriate in
having a relationship to Jesus’ presence with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that there are a lot
of actions that demonstrate that we have a relationship with the Lord Jesus. 
Three of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those are mentioned in today’s readings: hospitality,
suffering, and sitting at the feet of the Master.  In thinking over my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>own life, I realize that I have experienced all three at
different times in my life.  I believe we must be aware of each situation we
are in and decide what sort of response is the most appropriate at the time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are certain circumstances when it is important that we
demonstrate hospitality to others, in order to share the GOoD News with them. 
Sometimes we proclaim the message in word, sometimes in action, or possibly a
combination of both word and action.  In our willingness to go out of our way
in order that others might enjoy the fruits of our service, those whom we serve
will come to a better understanding of the love GOD has for them.  In acting
joyfully, as we lavish extra</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>care on others, we may further their experience of the
presence of GOD in their own lives and we will also experience that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At other times, we must be willing to suffer as a result of
demonstrating our commitment to the Gospel.  We may not experience the full
persecution and physical torments that Paul experienced, but we may have to
face insults, put-downs, or even abuses from those who are not willing to hear
the message we proclaim in our actions and by our words.   Being dedicated to a
cause often means doing things that are not pleasant, but that must be done. 
And what better cause for which to suffer than the cause of Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third action mentioned in the readings is that of
sitting and listening to the Lord Jesus.  As faithful, disciplined learners, we
must come to the Master and learn from Him.  Jesus calls this action as
performed by Mary in the Gospel, “the better part.”  It is the action that is
essential for all true disciples, whether they spent most of the time in the
service of hospitality or suffering for the cause.  And yet, many believers are
more devoted to action or passion than to meditation and reflection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the life of Mother Teresa.  Her ministry
was marked by daily actions of serving the needs of those who were most in need
of her care.  Physically, she suffered from medical problems.  But to her, the
most important part of her day was the hours spent in prayer and meditation. 
Her time sitting at the feet of her Master is what energized her to deal with
her suffering and to serve the needs of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, as disciples of Jesus, are called to be people of
hospitality and people who are willing to suffer for the Gospel.  We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are only able to do that if we are in relationship with the
Master Who has given us an example of being the Suffering Servant.  We must
spend time, each and every day, sitting, kneeling, and sometimes laying at His
feet.  We must listen to His Word and reflect on how we can apply it to our day
of service and possible suffering.  The Word of the Lord, taken, digested, and
linked to our daily activities, is the food and drink we must partake each and
every day.  In doing so, we will truly “live in the presence of the Lord” as
the Responsorial mentions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What do I see as my
primary missionary activity (today, this week, during my life)?  Am I being
called to be a proclaimer of the GOoD News by acts of hospitality and service?
Am I to give witness to the Gospel by my suffering? What is the source of my
strength – on what do I feed in order to keep me going? Am I spending enough
time sitting at the feet of the Master listening to His Word? How can I fit
more time into my day so that I can be attentive to the Lord as He speaks to
me? Do I need to get up earlier in the morning, or carve out a portion of the
day to allow me to reflect on GOD’s Word? How can I then take what I have
learned and be of service to others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the One Who comes to us in many
ways.  Through Your GOoDness, You manifest Your presence in our daily lives,
often without us fully recognizing the way You make Yourself known to us.  You
call us to be hospitable to those whom we encounter in our daily activities and
in doing so You are present with us.  You challenge us to be willing to suffer
for the sake of the Gospel as we share that message of Your love, both by our
words and actions. You have sent us Your Son, Jesus, as the Master-Teacher Who
not only taught by His words, but by His actions of service and by His
suffering.  As disciples of Your Son, we are asked to come to Him and learn
from Him for He is humble and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gentle of heart, the One Who came to serve even at the cost
of His own life.  May we find the time to spend it with You and Your Son as
Your Holy Spirit gives us the wisdom, strength, and courage to be faithful
disciples.  We make this prayer in union with Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and
Master-Teacher, Who has come as the Suffering Servant, dying and rising, and
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 14: 5-18;          Exodus 15: 1bc-2, 3-4,
5-6;           Matthew 12: 38-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How easy it is to fail to see GOD’s movement in our lives. 
The Israelites leaving Egypt start to complain against GOD as the Egyptians
follow them in hot pursuit.  After another manifestation of GOD’s power, Moses
leads the people in a song of thanksgiving in the Responsorial today.  In the
Gospel, Jesus declares that the unbelieving individuals will be liable for
their failure to accept Him and His message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading is the familiar account of the
Israelites leaving Egypt, being pursued by the Egyptians and coming to the Sea
(northern part of the Red Sea at the time).  As the Israelites sense the danger
of the approaching Egyptian army with the Pharaoh’s chariots and charioteers,
they complain against Moses and against GOD.  They want reassurance that Moses
is a true leader and that he has been sent by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  They fear for their lives.  They would rather have
died of old age as slaves than be slaughtered in the desert.  Moses chides the
people for their lack of trust in GOD.  He reminds them it was GOD Who called
them out of Egypt through mighty signs and wonders and that GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will continue to take care of them through even more
miraculous signs and deeds.  GOD first turns the divine cloud (which by day is
normally a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>column of smoke and by night a column of fire) into a cloud
of smoke (smoke screen) to block the Egyptians’ view of the Israelites (in v.
19 which is not part of today’s reading).  GOD then instructs Moses to extend
his rod over the Sea which parts and allows the Israelites to cross over
without any problems.  Just as they reach the other side of the Sea, the waters
(that have been separated) return to their normal levels upon the Egyptian
forces, drowning all of Pharaoh’s soldiers (tomorrow’s reading).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is also taken from the Book of Exodus and
is the hymn sung by Moses and the Israelites after their crossing of the Sea
and their deliverance by GOD.  It is a song of praise of GOD for the mighty
deeds done by GOD as the Israelites cross through the Sea and the Egyptians are
destroyed in the Sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, the scribes and Pharisees seek a sign
that GOD is with Jesus and that He has authority to do what He is doing.  Jesus
criticizes them for their lack of faith.  The only sign to be given to them is
the sign of Jonah – the prophet who was dead to the world for three days while
he was in the belly of the great</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>marine creature.  Jesus contrasts the faith of the Ninevites
(to whom Jonah preached a message of impending doom) with the lack of faith of
some of the religious leaders of His time.  When Jonah, the restored-to-life
prophet, preached the need for conversion (metanoia – change of heart), the
people of Nineveh repented.  Yet even when Jesus will rise from the dead, some
of the religious leader of His time will not change their hearts, even though
Jesus is greater than all other prophets and events of GOD’s self-revelation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am challenged to ask
myself, “Why is it that I keep seeking new signs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from GOD and I expect GOD to do great things for me before I
fully put my trust in the Lord Jesus?”  Oh, I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>profess faith in GOD (but so did the Israelites and the
scribes and Pharisees).  Yet, when it comes down to really tough times, I
bargain with GOD saying, “If you do this (or that), then I will continue to
trust in You.”  Or I say, “Lord Jesus, do what I want this time and then I will
change my life around, or I will perform some sort of sacrifice, or I will
donate to some charity.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our faith should not be based on what we want GOD to do for
us, it should be based on what GOD has already done for us:  GOD has given us
human life; GOD has given us salvation through Jesus’ death and resurrection. 
That does not mean that we should not present to GOD our needs.  We should. 
But we should not condition our further belief or trust in GOD upon something that
we demand GOD to do for us.  We should be in awe of what GOD continually does
for us, not waiting for GOD to fulfill our every desire (which may not be
according to GOD’s will).  We should look at all the ways GOD shows the divine
presence with us each and every day and thank GOD for constantly (many times
each day) for those signs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our attitude should be that expressed by Moses and the
Israelites in the Responsorial today, (but we should not have to wait until GOD
parts the water for us).  If we but look at how GOD has already acted in our
lives, we would be able to sing GOD’s praises and join in the hymn of thanks,
“I will sing to the LORD for the LORD is gloriously triumphant. . .My strength
and my courage is the LORD, and GOD has been my savior.  The LORD is my GOD,
and I will praise the LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I ever try to
bargain with GOD before I put my full faith in GOD? Once I have had a prayer
answered, do I always remember to thank GOD? Do my feelings of sorrow and/or
desire prevent me from experiencing the presence of the Risen Lord Jesus with
me?  When and under what conditions have I experienced the glorious deeds of
GOD in the last month? Last week? The last 24 hours? What can I do to help
bolster the faith of others when they have a sense of doom or caught between a
rock and hard place (or between the “Egyptians” and the Sea)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all GOoD things.  Through Your
graciousness and GOoDness, You have created us and brought us safely out of the
slavery of sin and through the waters to the new life, in and through Your Son,
Jesus.  Yet, many times we forget about Your loving deeds in the past and only
focus on our present troubles, wants, and desires.  We sometimes place limits
on our trust in You, waiting for You to fulfill our requests before we believe
more fully.  We focus so much on our hurt feelings and pain that we fail to see
the presence of You, Your Risen Son – Jesus, and the Holy Spirit.  For those
times when we have lacked complete trust in You, we seek You pardon and peace. 
Through the further inspiration of Your Holy Spirit, open our eyes to see the
mighty deeds that You continually do for us on a daily, even minute-to-minute,
basis.  May we always lift up a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to You,
especially for all You have done through Jesus.  We make this prayer in the
name of Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and Savior, the One Who has brought us
salvation through His ministry, death, and resurrection and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feast of St. Mary Magdalene</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Mary Magdalene:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-mary-magdalene</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Song of Songs 3: 1-4b  or  2 Corinthians 5:
14-17;         Psalm Ps 63: 2, 3-4, 5-6, 8-9; John 20: 1-2, 11-18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On this Feast of St. Mary Magdalene, our readings present an
aspect of Mary Magdalene and her seeking the Lord Jesus and wanting to have a
closer relationship with Him.  The first of the two possibilities for the First
Reading is from the Song of Songs.  In it, the bride longs for her lover and,
she goes out seeking him and asking people if they have seen him.  The other
choice for the First Reading is St. Paul’s words reminding us of the newness
that comes from a relationship with the Lord Jesus.  The Responsorial present
the desire to be with the LORD GOD.  The Gospel takes place on Easter Sunday
morning as Mary Magdalene experiences the empty tomb and wants to know where
the body of her Master-Teacher is.  She then encounters a person she supposes
is a gardener, but who is actually her longed-for beloved Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The book of the Song of Songs (or Canticle of Canticles or
Song of Solomon) is a love story.  Today’s passage presents the longing of a
bride for her beloved.  She travels throughout the city in search of her
lover.  She questions people about the whereabouts of the one for whom she
longs.  Finally, she encounters him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, there is a parallel with Mary Magdalene’s search
for Jesus after His death and burial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul (in the second choice for the First Reading) speaks
about his relationship with his Savior.  Although he never met Jesus before His
ascension, Paul’s first understanding of Jesus was of a human.  Yet as Paul has
grown in faith and belief in the death and resurrection of Jesus, he realizes
that Jesus has died for all.  Paul now has a deeper relationship with the
GOD-Man</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who has brought a whole new meaning of what life is for all
humans who embrace faith in the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist longs for a deeper relationship with GOD just
as thirsty individuals pine for water that refreshes and gives life.  Being
connected with GOD renews the believer and empowers the one who finds GOD with
a new life of joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel account focuses on Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Mary
may have been the woman from whom Jesus drove out seven demons (Luke 8: 2). 
Whether having these seven demons means she was mental ill, possessed, or a
simply a well-known sinner is not known for sure, all we know is that Mary
turned her life around and became a follower of the Lord Jesus and one of His
most dedicated disciples.  She was of assistance to Jesus and the rest of His
entourage.  She was at the foot of the cross as Jesus hung dying.  She, as
today’s Gospel relates, is at the tomb of Jesus early Easter Sunday morning and
finds the tomb empty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After telling the apostles, she returns to experience two
angels who speak of the Risen Lord.  She then encounters a Person whom she
supposes to be a gardener.  As the Man calls her by name, she realizes it is
the Risen Jesus.  She proclaims her relationship to Him by calling Him,
“Rabbouni – My Teacher.”  Jesus then makes her the Apostle to the Apostles by
telling her to go and share her experiences with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the thoughts that strikes me from this feast and from
the readings is the concept of seeking and finding </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Lord Jesus.  Like the bride in the passage from the Song
of Songs and like Mary Magdalene on Easter Sunday, we should longingly seek out
our Master-Teacher-Beloved.  We may have to search in various places and asks others
about where Jesus is.  But in the end, we may encounter His presence in the
least likely place and only after much effort has been made in being in
relationship again with our Savior and Lord.  We must be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>willing, as St. Paul mentions, to see Jesus in a new, ever
most truthful way – as our Master-Teacher-Beloved Lover.  We must, as Mary
Magdalene did, be willing to surrender our old “demon-possessed” life and go in
search of a new and deeper relationship with our Lord Jesus.  Again, I am not
saying that we actually have the devil in us and need an exorcism.  We all,
however, are influenced by various evils that come from living in a world that
is not promoting Gospel values.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we are not longing for, and pro-actively searching for, a
closer relationship with Jesus, there is something missing from our lives.  We
should want to deepen our relationship with a Beloved Lover by spending time
developing the closeness we want with Jesus.  It may take spending quiet time,
sitting at the feet of Jesus, as Mary Magdalene did.  We might have to be
present to others as they suffer, as Mary did at the foot of the cross. And
obviously, we should be willing to long for the deeper relationship with the
Lord Jesus, even to the point of going wherever we need to go in order to find
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to deepen our relationship with our Rabbouni
(personal Teacher), we should then, as Mary Magdalene did, be willing to go out
and announce the GOoD News that our Lord Jesus is alive and wants to have a
personal relationship with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often have I
been willing to go in search of my beloved Lover – Jesus?  How have I
encountered the Lord Jesus at times when I have almost lost hope? Am I
listening for Jesus to call me by name and reveal Himself to me?  How open have
I been to the Lord Jesus’ calling me to be the proclaimer of GOoD News to
other? What can I do to announce that glad tidings to those who are still in
pain, in sorrow, and in doubt?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all GOoDness.  Through Your
kindness, You put a longing in our souls to be with You and Your Son, in the
unity of the Holy Spirit.  You call us by name and desire us to have an
intimate relationship with Jesus, Your Son and our Master-Teacher.  We have not
fully understood Your ways.  Continue to extend Your healing and forgiving hand
to us.  May we follow the example of the women and men of faith, such as Mary
Magdalene and Paul, and listen to the Word of our Master and Teacher and
reflect on the newness that is being offered to us and to all people.  It is in
His name and through His ministry that we lift up this prayer.  To You be all
glory, honor, obedience, and praise, for You are our GOD, loving Abba-Father,
redeeming Son, and sanctifying Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 16: 1-5, 9-15;       Psalm 78: 18-19,
23-24, 25-26, 27-28;         Matthew 13: 1-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is a GOD Who provides for those who are prepared to
receive GOD’s GOoDness.  The passage from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exodus tells how GOD responds to the murmurings of the
Israelites who are at the end of their food supply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm relates the same event in the desert
of Sin.  The Gospel tells us about the providence of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD in the parable of the sower and the seed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading takes place just one month after the
Exodus from Egypt.  By now the food that the Israelites had taken from Egypt is
exhausted.  They begin to complain to Moses (and GOD) that when they were
slaves in Egypt, they at least had food to eat, now they are not sure from
where their next meal is going to come.  They seem to have forgotten how GOD
worked mighty signs and wonders (the ten plagues, the “parting” of the Sea, the
destruction of the Egyptian army) all within the last few months.  Even in the
midst of their complaints, GOD has compassion on them and shows divine
providence by providing “manna” and quail to eat. “Manna” was a flour-like
substance that appeared every day on the surface</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the desert of Sin (a name associated with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mt. Sinai, not called that because of the grumbling of the
Israelites – although their grumbling could be considered “sin” in our
understanding).  Manna was able to be made into bread.  The word is often associated
with the Aramaic word, man, that is a question (interrogative) word/expressing
meaning “What the. . ?” or “What is it?” [The Jerome Biblical Commentary
comments on the manna: “The manna is a honeydew excretion produced by two
species of scale insect that infest the tamarisk thickets of the area, which,
in fact, have gained the technical name tamarix mannifera [tamarisk bearing
manna]. From the leaves of the thicket the substance drops to the ground where
it becomes somewhat firm in the cool night air of the desert.  It has, however,
a low melting point (70NF) and hence must be gathered by 8:30 A.M. before the
sun causes it to melt.  To the Bedouins who still roam the area, it remains a
delicacy because of its sweet taste.” 3:38, p. 55.]  The quail, also another
natural occurring phenomenon in the desert of Sin, gives the Israelites evening
food.  What is miraculous is not that manna and quail appear, but that the
quantities of both that are present throughout the seasons of the year and for
the many years of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israelites’ journey through the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm relates the same events as in the First Reading. 
We hear about the people raising their discontent against GOD and GOD providing
for them with bread (manna) and flesh of birds.  GOD’s care toward the people
in spite of the people’s careless attitude toward GOD is evident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus instructs the people using a familiar
teaching tool – a parable.  Today’s parable is that of the sower sowing the
seed.  Some of the seeds that fall to the ground and land on the hardened
pathways where they are gobbled up by birds.  Other seeds settle on rocky
ground where they are not able to sink deep roots.  The seeds that find
themselves among the thorns are choked and prevented from growing.  That seeds
that end up in the rich, fertile</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>soil bear a rich harvest and return many times as much grain
as is planted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am struck by the efforts of
GOD in getting across the message of the extent of GOD’s love.  GOD wants
people to develop a relationship with the Divine Being.  In the Book of Exodus,
GOD has saved the Chosen People and led them out of slavery, and they begin to
forget the GOoDness of the LORD. They cannot see beyond their immediate desires
– for food.  Because their supply of food is running out, they do not remember
that GOD has promised to lead them to the Promised Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel also relates a message of GOD’s willingness to
produce rich blessings within people, but because of the external circumstances
of people’s lives, the fullness of GOD’s benefits are not always able to be
produced.  GOD wants the best for the people who are called, that includes
everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that I am not much different than the Israelites
of old.  I, too, complain when things do not go as I plan.  I worry about what
is happening in my life rather than trusting in GOD’s providence.  When my
supplies get low (whether the supplies be physical, spiritual, emotional,
financial), I start to doubt that my needs will be met.  I forget how GOD has
provided for me in the past and how the Lord Jesus has promised to not only
give me a return on my investment of time and energy, but to do it thirty,
sixty, and hundred times as much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The difficult challenge for me is to focus not on what I
don’t have or have in apparently small quantities, but rather to look to the
Lord Jesus Who gives abundantly to those who are fertile soil for GOD’s gifts. 
This means that I must prepare myself to receive GOD’s GOoDness by turning over
the ground of my life, letting the fresh air of GOD’s Spirit and the
precipitation of GOD’s love sink into my depths.  I must sometimes allow the
stinky fertilizer (manure) of life make my life more ready to accept the gifts
from GOD.  That is not easy.  It is not always a pleasant experience while I am
being prepared as a soil ready to accept GOD’s seed – The Word of GOD.  Yet,
the more that I allow myself to be primed for GOD’s action, the more rich will
be the harvest I will experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us reflect on GOD’s providence, not only in GOoD times
(although all times are GOoD times, if we open our eyes to see GOD’s action),
but in bad times as well.  Let us keep our eyes focused on the benevolence of
GOD.  And let us realize that all experience can help us prepare for GOD’s
planting the divine gifts in us that will produce a rich harvest for the Lord
Jesus and His Abba-Father in union with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often have I
forgotten the GOoDness of GOD because I have focused on what I seem to be
lacking?  How open have I been to GOD preparing me to be the recipient of GOD’s
Word and GOD’s blessings?   Do I see that the “stinking” times of my life can
be fertilizer that better prepares me to make GOoD use of what GOD gives me? 
What can I do to help others be better ground into which GOD’s Word can come
and produce a rich harvest?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all GOoDness.  Through Your
kindness, You provide not only what we need each day to survive (our daily
manna), but You plant Your seed within us that will produce a rich harvest if
we allow ourselves to be prepared for seed of Your Word.  At times we have
allowed Your gifts to be taken away by the enemy which/who swoops down to
remove the precious deposits that You have given us.  At other times we have
hardened our hearts so that Your richness cannot take root within us.  At other
times we have allowed our desire for worldly pleasures choke out Your
blessings.  For our not being fertile soil for Your providential gifts, we seek
Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the teaching and example of Your Son and
the outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, make us the best receptors for Your
blessings and therefore produce a rich harvest for Your greater glory and honor
and for the benefit those around us.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus,
Your Son, our Brother and our Master-Teacher, the Sower of Your Word and Your
GOoDness, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 19: 1-2, 9-11, 16-20b;     Daniel 3: 52,
53, 54, 55, 56;   Matthew 13: 10-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is mysterious.  In the passage from Exodus, Moses is
called to ascend the mountain of the LORD (Mount Sinai) in the midst of clouds,
smoke, thunder, fire, and lightning.  The Responsorial today comes from the
Book of Daniel.  It is part of the hymn sung by the young Hebrew men who are
praising GOD even while being in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>midst of the fiery furnace.  In the Gospel, Jesus tells His
disciples that the mysteries of GOD are shared with them but not revealed to
those who are not open to the Truth of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has not even been a full quarter of the year since the
Israelites left Egypt.  They are now at the foot of Mt.  Sinai.  GOD informs
the people that Moses is the chosen leader and to Moses will be revealed the
mysteries of GOD and Moses will proclaim those mysteries to the people.  After
traveling through the desert, the sights at Mt Sinai must have seemed ominous
and mysterious.  The mountain is covered in clouds with lightning flashing and
thunder clashing.  Moses is called to climb the mountain while the people wait
at the base camp (that is the camp at the base of the mountain).  The Israelite
are overwhelmed as they see their leader go into</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the storm clouds to confer with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is a hymn of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>praise sung by Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego as they walk
amid the white-hot flames of the furnace into which they have been thrown because
they would not worship the King of Babylon in the place of GOD.  Even though
the three young men were bound, they walk freely among the searing flames,
unfettered and unburned.  GOD mysteriously protects them and they in turn sing
GOD’s glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, when Jesus’ disciples ask Him about His
speaking in parables, He responds that mysteries of GOD are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>meant for those who are in relationship with Him and His
Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the disciples is given the understanding of the
mysteries, but to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who are not ready to listen to the Lord Jesus, only
confusion will be given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the mysteries of GOD, I recall that
mysterion (μυστεριον in Greek means “something that was not understood but is
now revealed.”  It can also mean “a sign of something yet to come” or “physical
sign of a spiritual reality.”  It does not mean a problem to be solved.  In
dealing with the mysteries of GOD, it implies that GOD is revealing a part of
Who GOD is (or what GOD’s plan is) in a way that was not known before.  GOD is
truly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mysterious, but that does not mean we must remain in the
dark about knowing GOD.  GOD wants us to walk in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Light and be enlightened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus truly came to reveal Who He is and Who His Abba is,
all under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  Yes, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we must be in awe in the presence of GOD, but that should
not cause us to dread GOD, but rather to seek to draw closer to the GOD Who is
self-revealing.  It also implies that we must spend time with GOD, not with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>purpose of coming to a great intellectual understanding of
the Triune GOD, but with the purpose of developing a personal relationship with
GOD.  Thus, our prayer and reflection time is not meant to be a theological
exercise in comprehending the essence of GOD, but rather time in which we live
in awareness of the presence of GOD with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At times, GOD may seem shrouded in clouds, a Divinity Who is
making the divine presence known with mighty sounds and sights, as the
Israelites experienced at Mt.  Sinai.  At other times, we will be able to
simply walk</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>safely in GOD’s presence while the flames of life burn all
around us, just as the three youths did in the fiery furnace of today’s
Responsorial.  That for which we should strive is spending time as faithful
disciples, sitting with the Master- Teacher, and having Him share with us the
mysteries of GOD by our living in the presence of the Lord Jesus, as He shares
about His Abba, in union with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal   question/action for today:   When   have  
I   been   struck   by the mysteriousness of GOD?  Has it led me to searching
to know the GOD Who is self- revealing and Who wants us to come into a deeper
relationship with the Triune GOD? How much time do I spend in reflecting on
GOD’s presence with me, the Lord Jesus’ revealing Who GOD is, through the
Spirit’s wisdom? What can I do to assist others in drawing ever closer to the
GOD Who mysteriously calls us into a relationship?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all mysteries.  Through Your
GOoDness, we are privileged to experience Your mysteries as You enfold Your
plan of salvation in and through Your Son, Jesus.  He invites us to come to Him
as disciplined learners who sit at His feet and hear Him as He reveals Your
blessings and the essence of Your being.  For the times we have failed to be open
and not listened to Your message, we seek Your forgiveness and shalom-peace. 
Continue to fill us with the gifts of Your Holy Spirit, especially wisdom,
understanding,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>right judgment, counsel, knowledge, discernment, and awe in
Your presence, so that we may not only have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>better knowledge of Your mysteries, but also be able to
share that knowledge with others as we live our lives touched by Your

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint James, the Apostle:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-james-the-apostle</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Corinthians: 4: 7-15;          Psalm 126:
1bc-21b, 2cd-3, 4-5, 6;           Matthew 20: 20-28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Feast of St. James, apostle.  We know
a little about St. James. He was the brother of St. John.  The two were the
sons of Zebedee, “sons of thunder.” They had been fishers before being called
by Jesus to leave their nets and follow Him.  St. James (as one of the chosen
three, along with St. John and St. Peter) was privileged to be present for the
Transfiguration, the raising of the dead girl, and the agony in the Garden, all
of these events when none of the other apostles were present to the same degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings remind us today that even though St. James was
one of the three</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples closest to Jesus, he was not perfect.  In the
First Reading from St. Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians, we hear that
the followers of Jesus are vessels, not made of precious metal or priceless
gems, but earthen, clay pots.  Yet, they have the privileged of being something
in which the Most Precious exists, they are vessels of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel presents the mother of James and John asking a
favor of Jesus, and Jesus’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>response.  The whole incident causes tension among all the
apostles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul speaks about those who are
followers of the Lord Jesus as being clay pots.  They are made from the simple
clay of the earth.  They are common items.  Yet in these earthen vessels, the
Lord Jesus Himself is present.  GOD uses these simple, earthen vessels to be
the instruments through which the Most Precious Gift of all is brought and
shared with all the peoples, in all nations and lands. Earthen vessels are more
fragile than items made of metal.  They are less valuable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>than containers which are made of silver or gold, inlaid
with precious stones.  Yet GOD chooses just common, ordinary, breakable items
(people) to be the vehicles through which Jesus comes to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today speaks about the rejoicing of those coming
back from exile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They are compared to the reapers who come back from the
harvest fields carrying the product of the their labors.  After all the work
that has been done, they can rejoice to see the fruit of their work in the
abundant harvest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel from Matthew, Salome (the mother of James
and John) makes a request of Jesus.  (In Mark’s account, it is James and John
who make this request,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not their mother).  She wants her two boys to have the
places of distinction, sitting right next to Jesus in His Reign.  Jesus asks
James and John if they are willing “to drink the cup” that Jesus will drink –
an illusion to sharing in Jesus’ ministry – even unto death.  They assertively
affirm their willingness. Jesus remarks that they truly will follow in their
Master’s steps, even to the point of suffering and death, yet the place of
honor in the Reign of GOD is reserved to be given by Jesus’ Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflected on the reading today, I realized how “earthy”
James was (and John and the other disciples also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>were).  The disciples of Jesus were not from some
aristocratic families, not men of the priestly clan or royal lineage.  They
were people of the common working class, such as fishers and tax collectors. 
Jesus took these ordinary individuals and entrusted to them the continuation of
His sacred ministry.  They were truly human, with a human desire to be
important.  Yet, Jesus tells them what is most important is not to have a place
where they can be waited on by others, but to be the waiters who serve others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This causes me to reflect on my own attitude in being a
disciple of Jesus.  At times I have thought about having a special job of
distinction, a place of honor in the divine plan.  Yet I, like James and his
companions, am merely a clay container that/who has the privilege of holding
and bringing to others my vessel’s Precious Content</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– Jesus.  I, too, am fragile and able to be broken.  Yet, it
is my honor to be the instrument through which Jesus is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>made known to others.  I am not special myself.  What I bear
and bring to other is what is important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The way I bring my valuable treasure to others is through my
acts of loving service.  Jesus is asking me to do what He asked James and John
to do:  to drink of His cup, to be willing to give myself fully in the service
of others.  That is what makes me a precious vessel in the hands of the Master. 
And if I can serve others, even to the point of giving of my life, it is then
that I will be able to rejoice like the reapers returning from the harvest. 
Yes, I will have worked hard (similar to the workers in the Responsorial Psalm)
to help bring in the rich bounty or harvest, but it is GOD Who gives the growth
to the product.  I am just privileged to have worked in the Lord Jesus’ field
and to have experienced the richness and abundance of GOD’s harvest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us take to heart today’s readings and rejoice that we,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ordinary and common vessels, are being permitted to be
instruments in the divine plan of GOD’s salvation.  Let us manifest our
willingness to be a part by lovingly serving those who cross our paths.  And
may we rejoice that GOD’s preciousness is being brought forward for more and
more people to enjoy.  For it is the treasure of the Lord Jesus that we have
had the privilege to carry within our simple, earthen vessels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think about
my being a vessel that GOD uses to bring the precious treasure of the Lord
Jesus to others, how do I feel?  Do I consider myself a precious vessel, made
of valuable metals and precious stones, or a simple clay pot? In what ways can
I serve others as Jesus Himself came to serve rather than to be served?  Who is
most in need of my being an instrument of the Lord Jesus today? This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, almighty GOD, yet “down to earth”
LORD.  Through Your GOoDness, You have chosen us to be the clay pots into which
Your precious Son has come and continues to make His presence known to others. 
Our value comes not from who we are, but from Your Son’s presence in our
lives.  We often think so highly of what we do and what we have accomplished. 
We desire to have the places of honor.  Yet, You have given us reminders of
what is important through the examples of Your Son and His disciples.  Today,
as we reflect on the life of St. James, we give You praise that Your Son
chooses ordinary individuals to whom He entrusted the precious gift of His
ministry.  He called them from catching fish to netting people and bringing
them into Your Reign.  They carried His message through their lives of service,
even to the point of following their Master in death.  May we realize the privilege
we have to walk behind these people of faith who have preceded us.  We give You
glory and praise for allowing us – clay/simple hunks of earth – to be the
vessels through which Your Son comes to others.  To You we lift this prayer of
honor and thanks, in union with Your Son, Who has called us, the One Who is our
Master and Teacher, the One Whom we serve as we serve our brothers and sisters,
and Who is living and reigning in Your Reign together with the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Joachim and Anne:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saints-joachim-and-anne</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 24: 3-8;             Psalm 50: 1b-2, 5-6,
14-15;             Matthew 13: 24-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is the initiator of the bond (covenant) that exists
between GOD and humans.  GOD gives the initial growth and GOD is also the
purpose or end of the growth.  Today’s First Reading describes the Old Covenant
(Testament) that GOD established at Mt. Sinai and the people’s response –
offering a sacrifice to GOD.  The psalm describes the LORD as the judge who
brings the faithful ones into the divine presence.  In the Gospel, Jesus shares
the parable of the wheat that grows together with the weeds until the harvest
time when the wheat and weeds will be collected and the wheat will be brought
into the presence of the owner of the field, while the weeds will be burned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading takes place after Moses has received the
Ten Commandments and other laws from GOD.  He shares them with the people, and
they agree to be bound by the rules and ordinances.  A covenant ritual then
celebrates the people’s acceptance of GOD’s commands and unites them to GOD. 
The ritual consists in the killing of bulls and the splashing of the animals’
blood (life force) on the altar (signifying GOD) and on the people. They are
now connected by a blood bond.  This means that the people are joined to GOD
and GOD to them.  If they break the union by disobeying the laws, then they can
expect to face the same consequences as the bulls who were killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm also speaks of being united with GOD in covenant
relationship symbolized in a sacrifice not just of animals, but of praise of
GOD.  The result of the covenant relationship should not just be fear of the
punishments to be inflicted for breaking the covenant, but more importantly,
gratitude to GOD for uniting the people with the LORD.  The people should offer
a sacrifice of praise in thanksgiving for GOD’s establishing of this covenant
(testament, relationship, bond) with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus again shares a parable with the crowd. 
This parable likens the Reign of GOD to the spread of weeds among the wheat. 
There are many aspects to this parable.  First, the sower intends only growth
of GOoD seed (wheat).  An enemy works against the sowing of the GOoD seed by
spreading bad seed of weeds.  The word translated as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“weeds” is actually the darnel, a poisonous weed that in its
early growth looks much like young wheat.  Important to the parable is the
wisdom of the owner (GOD) in not pulling the weeds (darnel or tares) up because
it would also uproot the wheat.  It is a reminder that the job of separating</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the GOoD growth from the bad and making the final judgment
about what is of GOoD seed and what is of bad seed is left to the owner of the
field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is hard to distinguish the GOoD from the bad while they
both are maturing and growing.  It is only at the end of the growing season
that they can be separated, with the GOoD coming into the presence of the owner
and bad being bound and burned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I realize that I, too,
am united to GOD by a blood covenant.  The Blood of Jesus has made it possible
for me to be in union with GOD in a way that surpasses anything I could do or
expect myself.  My response must be that of offering a sacrifice of praise.  I
am sacrificing myself (being made holy) by </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thanking and praising GOD.  It is not that what I do that
makes me holy, it is GOD’s action in response to my being grateful for GOD’s
action that makes me holy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secondly, I also see the importance that I do not make a
judgment about the growth of others around me. Particularly I must not think
that I am of GOoD seed while others are of bad seed.  While we continue to grow
in the earthly field, it is hard to tell the wheat from the darnel (or tare). 
We can identify certain actions as being sinful, but we cannot label the person
as totally alien from GOD.  GOD can still allow the darnel to be transformed
into wheat, after all GOD turned water into blood at the time of the Exodus,
produced manna in the desert, brought forth water from the rock.  Jesus also
changed water into wine.  My job is not to condemn a person because of what
outward signs are manifested at a particularly point in the life of the person,
even though</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can point out actions that are not of GOoD (not of GOD). 
I also realize that I, too, have days when I might look more like darnel than
wheat, days when I am more poisonous than GOoD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our GOD is truly loving and caring.  GOD wants to have a
relationship with us.  GOD has acted first in a way to cause the possibility
for us to be bound in a covenant.  Our response should be that of being as
faithful to the covenant relationship (and its requirements) as we can be –
growing into as fruitful persons as GOD has intended us to be.  We should seek
to give to GOD the only thing we really can offer – our sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving.  We should avoid the poison that may appear to be coming from
some of the other growing life- forms around us, but we should not condemn
those life-forms (people) because GOD can still transform them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into GOoD growth, if they choose to turn from their evil
ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe the psalm, once again, ties the readings together
and gives us a way of responding to the Word of GOD.  “‘Gather my faithful ones
before Me, those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.’  And the
heavens proclaim GOD’s justice; for the LORD alone is the judge. . .‘Offer to
GOD praise as your sacrifice and fulfill your vows to the Most High; then call
upon Me in time of distress; I will rescue you and you shall glorify Me.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my response
to the bad growth I see around me? Do I tend to condemn the individuals and want
to pull them out, presuming that I am the GOoD growth, that I am holier than
the bad growth?  Am I concerned about the poisonous seeds that can lead others
to bad growth, and do I work to provide an example and environment in which the
bad growth can be transformed into GOoD growth? Am I aware of the poisonous
evil in my own life and seek GOD’s forgiveness and healing? Do I give GOD a
sacrifice of praise and thanks?  What can I do to edify (build up) the GOoD
growth (people) around me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all living beings.  You have
not only given life to humans by breathing Your Ruah-Spirit into them, but You
have planted Your GOoDness within us.  While Your enemy has sown poisons in
Your field, You wisely allow Your GOoD seed to grow in the midst of bad, giving
opportunity for the bad to change to GOoD.  We thank You for establishing such
a loving, life-giving relationship with us and calling us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to grow into the life form that can produce the harvest You
desire and deserve.  We ask Your forgiveness for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>times we have allowed the enemy’s poison to infiltrate into
our lives, and failed to live up to the growth You expect from us.  Help us to
be sources of positive influences on those who are affected by the poisons of
the enemy.  And may we now and at the time of the final harvest, lift up to You
our sacrifice of praise and thanks. We make this prayer in the name of Your
Son, Jesus, the One Who works among us to redeem us and transform us into the
GOoD harvest for You.  He is the Master-Teacher Who is living and reigning in
Your Reign together with the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Genesis 18: 20-32;      Psalm 138: 1-2, 2-3, 6-7,
7-8;     Colossians 2: 12-14;     Luke 11: 1-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings today speak of a couple of ways to relate to
GOD – most obvious (from the First Reading and Gospel) is that of asking, even
bargaining, with GOD for what we need, and secondarily (from the Second
Reading) is that of reflecting on what GOD has done for us in and through
Jesus.  In the First Reading, Abraham is seen as bargaining with GOD in
reference to GOD’s forsaking the punishment of the GOoD people in the cities of
Sodom and Gomorrah. The Responsorial is a prayer expressing the fact that GOD
hears the petition of those who call upon the LORD.  In the Second Reading, St.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul reminds the Colossians that they have been united to
the Lord Jesus through their baptism for they have died (to sin) and risen to
new life as they are linked to Jesus’ death and resurrection.  In the Gospel,
Luke has Jesus presenting the Lord’s Prayer to His disciples in response to
their request to learn how to pray, and He goes on to say that they should lift
up their needs to the GOD Who hears their prayers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Genesis account portrays the typical Middle Eastern act
of negotiating a request by the process of progressive bargaining. When Abraham
is told about the upcoming destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, he
barters with GOD, trying to be sure that his GOoD nephew Lot and his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>family are saved from the impending disaster that will
befall the sinful citizens of the two cities.  Abraham uses different appeals
to GOD, first appealing to the divine sense of justice and not “punishing” the
GOoD with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the bad.  Abraham starts with the number 50 innocent people.
Using humility and acknowledging GOD’s power and importance, Abraham in stages
works</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the number down to 45, 40, 30, 20, and finally 10.  GOD
hears, and then responds positively to each of Abraham’s request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm has been chosen to reflect the fact that GOD hears
the pleading of those who seek GOD’s help.  As typical of the Hebrew concept of
prayer, the petitioning is linked to praise and acknowledgment of the wonderful
things GOD has done and GOD’s gracious attributes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addressing his letter to the people of Colossae, St. Paul
reminds them that in and through their baptism they have been united with
Christ and His paschal mysteries.  Just as Jesus has died and then risen, they,
too, have died to their old sinful lives and been raised to new life.  Their
being joined to Christ Jesus has truly given them a new relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the disciples once again see Jesus absorbed
in prayer.  They want to have a share in the relationship that Jesus has with His
Abba (Father). Responding to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their request to learn how to pray, Jesus shares with them
the Model Prayer (Luke’s version of the “Our Father”).  Jesus then continues to
expound upon the importance of prayer by comparing how people, even sinful and
uncaring people, respond to repeated requests.  Jesus ends this pericope by
inviting His disciples to be steadfast in prayer and to keep on asking,
seeking, and knocking on GOD’s door.  What is interesting is the form of the
Greek verbs that are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>used as Jesus tells His disciples to ask, seek, and knock. 
The verb form implies repeated, continuous action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, the theme of prayer comes
through loudly.  Most of us are quite familiar with the meaning of prayer that
comes from the Middle English word meaning “ask.”  If we use this connotation,
it seems that Jesus is saying</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that prayer is primarily a matter of asking, and asking
again.  Yet, the Hebrew concept of prayer (berakah) has a much richer
connotation.  Prayer (berakah) means first and foremost to praise.  Abraham was
aware of this in the First Reading as he acknowledges the greatness of, and he
praises, the Person from Whom he is requesting a favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I like to think of the word ACTS when I think of prayer.  To
me, prayer should be a fourfold process.  First and foremost, in prayer we
Adore – that is we acknowledge GOD for Who GOD is – the Almighty and Holy One. 
Notice that the first part of the Model Prayer mentions “hallowed be Your name”
and “Your kingdom come.”  The next part of prayer is Contrition in which we
acknowledge who we are – especially in relationship to GOD – we are sinful and
unworthy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham models this aspect of prayer in the way he humbly
“presumes” to bargain with his LORD even though he is “but dust and ashes.”  In
the Model Prayer we also pray that GOD will forgive us our sins (trespasses,
transgressions). The third aspect of prayer is  Thanksgiving. We give</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thanks not only for what GOD has done (notice</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the first verses of today’s Responsorial Psalm), but we also
need to give thanks to GOD for what GOD will be doing (fourth stanza of today’s
psalm – “The LORD will complete what GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>done for me”).  Lastly, and appropriately so, is 
Supplication – asking and seeking and knocking on GOD’s door.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I think of prayer as  Adoration,  Contrition, 
Thanksgiving, and Supplication, it reminds me that prayer is all about
relationship.  The more that I spend time in prayer (as Jesus is doing at the
start of the Gospel), the more I am in relationship with GOD.  And the more I
am in relationship with GOD (like Abraham in the First Reading) the more I can
“presume to speak” to my Lord Jesus and His Abba.  That relationship cannot be
manifested just when I am in need.  It must be a repeated, continuous, on-going
action.  I must recall my relationship with GOD at all times.  This is why Paul
tells us to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pray constantly (Ephesians 6: 18) with all sorts of petition
paralleling what Jesus says in today’s Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we spend time working on our relationship with GOD,
conscious of that relationship at all times, we will be able to speak with the
GOD Whom we are told to call upon as Our Abba.  Being in GOoD relationship with
GOD, we will know Who GOD is, and Who we are.  We will be able to constantly
thank GOD and we will lift up the needs, not only of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>own, but those of others (as Abraham did for Lot and his
family).  The challenge is to realize that we are in that relationship at all
times – we have been united with GOD through our joining in Jesus’ death and
victory over sin (our sin) and His rising and lifting us up to new life, as St.
Paul reminds us in the Second Reading.  If we are aware of that, then we can
truly keep on asking, seeking, and knocking, and the Abba Who loves us and Who
is GOD will continue to give GOoD gifts to us as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my concept
of prayer? When and how often do I pray? Do I spend at least as much time
praising and thanking GOD as I do rattling off my list of petitions?  How can I
be more conscious of my need for a prayerful relationship with GOD? What steps
will I take today in order to spend more time with GOD? What are some practical
ways that I can remember to pray constantly?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Almighty and Loving Abba. 
Through Your GOoDness, You call us into a relationship with You, especially in
and through the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Your Son.  We
acknowledge and adore You as our GOD, Giver of life, Provider of all that we
need.  We are no more than dust and ashes, and we have sinned, but You have
graciously called us to be Your children.  We lift up our voices in praise and
thanks of You.  We express our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gratitude for what You have done throughout our human
history and in our individual lives.  We thank You for continuing to pour out
Your love now and in the future.  It is with this sense of adoration,
contrition, and thanks that we can come to Your and lift up our petitions and
needs.  Continue to pour out Your Holy Spirit upon us so that we can draw ever
closer to You, Your Son, and the Holy Spirit.  May we constantly express our
relationship with You in every thing we do and say. We make this prayer in the
name of Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher, Who has told us how to be in
relationship with You and made it possible through His saving acts, and Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 32: 15-24, 30-34;      Psalm 106: 19-20,
21-22, 23        Matthew 13: 31-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to reveal the divine essence (Who GOD Is) to
people, but some are not open to that revelation, others act contradictory to
that revelation.  In the First Reading, while Moses is on the mountain of the
LORD experiencing the revelation of GOD, the Israelites form a golden calf to
represent GOD.  The psalm retells the events dealing with golden calf.  In the
Gospel, Jesus shares two more parables with the crowd, yet some do not
understand the meaning and the Truth contained within the parables, and
therefore they miss what GOD is revealing to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the month while Moses is up on the mountain of GOD –
Mt. Sinai – GOD continues to reveal Who GOD is and what the LORD expects of the
people.  GOD writes the commandments and precepts on two tablets of stone. The
verses before today’s reading from Exodus relate how the Israelites want</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to worship GOD, but unlike the Egyptians from whose slavery
they have escaped, they do not have any image of GOD.  They beseech Aaron, the
brother of Moses and the temporary leader of the people (while Moses is on Mt.
Sinai with GOD).  Aaron allows gold jewelry to be collected and a golden</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>calf is produced, not as a false GOD, but as a symbol of the
one and only GOD. The problem is that GOD forbids any image be made of GOD. 
When Moses descends part way down the mountain, he and Joshua converse about
the sounds that are echoing up the mountain.  When they descend, they see the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people worshiping the golden calf.  Moses, in anger, throws
down the tablets of stone on which GOD had written the commandments.  After
angrily denouncing the people’s sin and Aaron’s allowing such disregard for
GOD’s commands,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moses promises to go back up the mountain and plead for
mercy from the GOD Who has been transgressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm retells the story of golden calf and Moses’
willingness to seek from GOD the forgiveness of the people’s sin.  Moses is
seen as defending the relationship that GOD established with the people, almost
reminding GOD of the divine promises made to bring the people into the Promise
Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues to preach to the people using
parables. Today’s parables of the mustard seed and the leaven in the bread dough
speak about the phenomenon that will take place in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>growth of the Reign of GOD.  What Jesus begins with a
handful of followers will spread throughout the world.  Jesus uses parables to
reveal GOD’s mysterious plan of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflection on the readings moves me to realize how much
GOD wants to be known by people and to what extend Jesus will go to reveal the
love of GOD for people.  GOD desires people to be in relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the GODhead.  Yet, like the Israelites of old, how easy
it is for individuals and groups to miss the point of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s self-revelation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know there have been times in my own life when I have
misunderstood GOD’s plan for my life and what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wanted me to do and to know.  I have tried to convince
GOD that my ideas are what should be happening. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember a few times when I prayed to GOD expressing my
desires not to be in certain locations.  Once I prayed that I would not have to
work in San Francisco.  I informed my supervisors that I did not want to be
assigned to the “City” but would be happy to be anywhere else in the Bay Area. 
GOD had other plans.  I was assigned to work in the Outer Mission district of
San Francisco, not too far from old Candlestick Park.  It turned out to be a
blessing for me that I would never have experienced if I were assigned anywhere
else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another time I prayed that I would be able to live in the
mountains, but I put in an addendum, anywhere in the mountains except around
Lake Tahoe.  As it turned out, I ended up living in South Lake Tahoe for six
years and I was blessed with friends with whom I still communicate today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At other times, I tried to “theologize” about GOD and show
my “expert knowledge” about scripture.  Yet, I sometimes failed to develop my
relationship with the GOD Who was trying to be known through my studies.  It
was when I was at a time in my life when I needed to have more than an
intellectual knowledge of GOD, that I truly came to “know” GOD – have a more
personal relationship with GOD.  I desired a personal contact with GOD, and
that is when I really began to learn Who GOD Is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy for us to make our own image of GOD, maybe not
a golden image, but our mental image of GOD.  GOD does not want to be
memorialized by some picture or symbol, although they can be helpful.  GOD
wants to be involved in the personal life of individuals.  Yes, Jesus spoke in
parables, that were symbolic images of the Truth, but the parables were meant
to lead us to the Truth – Jesus, Himself – and to His Abba-Father.  As we
continue our journey through life, let us seek to remember that it is Jesus Who
saves us, and let us give thanks to GOD Who is Abba, Son, and Spirit.  And may
they never say about us what is said of the Israelites of old in today’s
psalm:  “They forgot the GOD Who saved them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my “image”
of GOD? Do I seek to make GOD into what I want GOD to be, or am I open to truly
come to “know” GOD through the various ways that GOD reveals to me? Am I
spending enough time learning from the Master-Teacher through my time of prayer
and reading of GOD’s Word? Am I willing to share my thoughts with others and be
open to what others share with me? Do I positively encourage others to spend
time with the Word of GOD and seek to develop a deeper relationship with GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all salvation, through Your
GOoDness we have been given the opportunity to develop a relationship with
You.  Yet, in our excitement, fear, or misunderstanding, we have developed
false images of Who You are.  For our missing the mark and letting ourselves
not deepen our relationship with You, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness. 
Jesus, Your Son, came as the Master-Teacher Who first spoke the Truth in
parables and later revealed Himself as the Truth, all with the purpose of
drawing us ever closer to You. Continue to enlighten us with Your Holy Spirit
so that we may grow in appreciation and love of Who You are and have a personal
relationship with You.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, the
Master- Teacher Who is living and reigning in Your Reign together with the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Martha, Mary, and Lazarus:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saints-martha-mary-and-lazarus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 33: 7-11; 34: 5b-9, 28;      Psalm 103:
6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13; John 11: 19-27  or  Luke 10: 38-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For me, a key word that flows from the readings is
“patience.”  In the passage from Exodus, Moses pleads for divine patience as
GOD deals with Israelites and their unfaithfulness.  The Responsorial declares
the attributes of GOD that show GOD’s patience and understanding.  In the
Gospel from John, Jesus teaches St. Martha (and Mary in verses not read) about
being patience as they wonder why Jesus did not come sooner to prevent their
brother Lazarus from dying.  In the Gospel from St. Luke, Martha is challenged
to be patient and to look at the value of being in Jesus’ presence, not just as
a servant, but as a discipline learner (disciple) as Mary is doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading first pictures Moses going into the
presence of GOD in the Meeting Tent.  A little anachronism is present here,
because it is not until a few chapters from this that GOD tells the Israelites
how to build the Meeting Tent where Moses may be in the presence of GOD.  In
the first omitted verses in today’s reading, Moses is then pictured as climbing
the Mountain of the LORD again to ask forgiveness from GOD for the people’s sin
of being impatient with Moses’ not returning quickly from Mt. Sinai and their
sin of building a golden calf to represent GOD.  Moses once again ascends the
Mountain of GOD (Mt. Sinai) to get a new copy of the Ten Commandments, since he
had shattered the first set in anger when he came down from the mountain and
saw how impatient the people had become.  Moses pleads with GOD for patience
with a “stiff-necked” people.  Although the words of his prayer start off with
the word, “If I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>find favor with You, O LORD. . .” Moses realizes that it is
not his own deeds that cause GOD to find favor.  It might be better translated
as “As a divine favor to me, O LORD. . .”  He reminds GOD that the LORD is
known for being merciful and gracious.  I would guess that GOD also spoke to
Moses about Moses’ need to be patient and to not throw down the stone tablets
of the law in anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reiterates that fact that GOD is kind, merciful,
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gracious, not dealing with us as our sins deserve but being
compassionate and forgiving.  How patient GOD must be with us since we sin
again and again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a different perspective on patience with GOD in the
accounts of the saints of the day – Saints Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.  Martha
becomes impatient as she serves Jesus without Mary’s help and by her concern
for her dead brother.  The two Gospel accounts that can be read on this feast
show us how Martha is challenged be more patient and to look at what it means
that Jesus is present with her and she must live out that presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account from Luke 10 gives us the picture of Martha
being busy about hospitality and tending to the needs of Jesus and His
companions.  Martha becomes impatient and complains to Jesus about Mary’s not
helping with the chores, but Mary’s just sitting at the feet of Jesus and
listening to Him.  Mary is truly a patient disciple (disciplined learner) who
sees her role in listening to the Master-Teacher.  Jesus commends Mary for her
desire</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to be with the Master-Teacher.  Jesus teaches Martha that
even though hospitality and serving others is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>important, it is also important to just be patient and to be
present with the Master-Teacher and allow Him to share His patience as He
teaches.  It is then one can take in GOD’s Word and then prophetically live it
out in action and words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel account from John 11, Martha has obviously
learned to listen better to Jesus.  Although she begins by expressing her
impatient disappointment or anger that Jesus did not come sooner to help her
brother and prevent him from dying, she is able to put her trust in Jesus.  She
knows that Jesus is able to work wonders because of His relationship to, and
His presence with, His Abba-Father - Who is GOD.  She also professes her faith
and patience in the resurrection of the dead.  Lastly, she boldly affirms that
Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize how patient GOD is. 
I recall also that the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>word “patient” comes from the Latin word patiens that means
“suffering.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another translation of the word “patient” is
“long-suffering.”  GOD “suffers” through dealings with us mortals. Although GOD
could have designed creation and creatures differently, making everyone and
everything have to do exactly as GOD wanted, GOD decided to create humans with
free will.  The LORD desired to have the consciously aware part of creation
(humans) have the ability to freely choose to be in relationship with GOD. Yet
having the ability to freely choose to be in relationship also means having the
ability to choose not to be relationship.  GOD “suffers” (is patient) as people
choose not to be in relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is also patient in allowing people to change their
disposition in regard to being in relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>divine.  We are given chances again and again, to turn from
being “away from GOD” (a theos) toward being “toward GOD” (ad Deum).  GOD
desires that all creation be ad Deum (heading toward GOD), thus given everyone
multiple chances to repent (metanoia), to change heart, to change one’s
direction and head “toward GOD”- ad Deum rather than “away from GOD”- a theos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Metanoia (repentance and change of heart) needs to be
present always.  Yes, we can make an initial commitment to GOD, but there is
also a bit of re-alignment we must do, because we get sidetracked and
backslide.  We need to constantly renew our commitment and ask GOD for the strength
to be more faithful. That is what Moses did in the First Reading today.  We
must model Moses’ prayer and GOD will hear our prayer, as GOD heard Moses’
prayer.  Let us make our prayer:  “As a divine favor to me and Your people, O</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD, do come along in our company.  We are indeed a
stiff-necked people; yet pardon our wickedness and sins, and receive us as Your
own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think of
the patience of GOD, what thoughts and feelings do I have?  How have I tried the
patience of GOD?  How have I experienced GOD’s extending divine patience to
me?  How can I model that patience in dealing with others? What aspects of my
life still need to be re-aligned so that they are more ad Deum (toward GOD)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of patience, always merciful and
gracious, slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continue to extend Your love to us, even though we have turned
away from You (a theos).  For the times we have chosen to not be in
relationship with You, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  We thank You for
sending Your Son, Jesus, to remind us of Your loving kindness and patience
through His life, ministry, suffering (passion or patiens), death, and
resurrection.  He modeled and demonstrated Your patience in the way He dealt
with those to whom He ministered.  Continue to fill us with the gifts of Your
Holy Spirit, especially the harvest where there is the fruit of patience and
fruit of kindness, so that we can help others come to a greater appreciation of
You as the GOD of patience.  As always, we lift this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer to You, in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, our Master-Teacher and Model of patience,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who was willing to be “long suffering” especially in His
passion and death, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 34: 29-35;         Psalm 99: 5, 6, 7,
9;           Matthew 13: 44–46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being in relationship with GOD changes everything.  In the
passage from Exodus, Moses’ face is radiant as he leaves the presence of GOD. 
The psalm praises GOD’s holiness and declares that those who are in a
relationship with GOD are truly blessed.  In the Gospel, Jesus relates two
parables that speak about the superior value of being part of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading describes Moses as he descends the
mountain of the LORD.  His face has become radiant since he was in the presence
of the LORD and has looked on the face of GOD.  Aaron and the Israelites notice
the change in Moses.  Moses covers his face with a veil because of the
overpowering radiance that shines forth from his face.  Every time Moses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>re-enters the presence of the LORD, he lifts his veil to be
re-enlightened and re-charged by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm proclaims the holiness and awesomeness of GOD. 
Those, like Moses, Aaron, and the prophet Samuel are blessed because of their
ability to call upon the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD and worship on the holy mountain of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both of the parables, that Jesus shares with the crowd in
today’s Gospel, stress the great value of being part of the Reign of GOD. Being
in relationship with GOD as members of GOD’s Reign is truly more valuable than
all else.  It brings joy to those who experience it, enabling them to sell all
they have to be a part of GOD’s Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings two thoughts come to mind:  1)
how enormously valuable it is to have a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with GOD; 2) how being in touch with GOD can
transform a person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a men’s Bible Study I attended, I recall one of the
gentlemen, who gathered at 6:00 a.m., discussed how easy it is to be caught up
in the world’s value.  Wealth, fame, even food can become the treasures we seek
above all else.  We sink all of our time, energy, and money into amassing
treasures.  Yet, those who have the most “things” seem to be the least happy. 
One of the members of the Bible Study group mentioned that he had once been on
a trip to Alaska.  He had the opportunity to visit some native Alaskans who
live in remote areas of the state, with no electricity, no stores, no steady
income.  They got up each day and traverse the countryside</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>looking for food for the day, and hopefully a little extra
to store for the long winter when temperatures drop to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30°F or 40°F below zero.  Yet, the traveler noticed how
truly joyful these individuals were, even though they do not know if they will
be blessed with finding food that day, or even the next day.  What they seem to
value is a relationship with the Creator GOD Who provides for them, even in the
worst of times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that I have not always placed my relationship with
GOD as the number one priority of my life.  Oh, I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spend time praying and putting in my time with GOD, but
being in relationship with the Lord Jesus and His </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit has not always
been at the top of my list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on how being in touch with GOD changes people,
I think about individuals whom I have known</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or read about.  Their lives have gone through such a
transformation that they are almost diametrically opposite to what they used to
be.  And one of the most dramatic changes is going from being worried and angry
to having a sense of peace and joy.  Even though they are facing trying times,
they exude a certain – well, the word used concerning Moses’ face fits –
radiance.  They are radiant.  They radiate the presence of GOD and seem to
enable those around them to be more calm and reassured.  It is a relaxing and
comforting feeling just being around these individuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being aware of being in a daily, hourly, minute-by-minute
relationship with GOD empowers an individual to know that GOD is in control. 
That does not free them from doing what they need to do, but it frees them from
worrying about anything other than seeking to be in GOD’s presence.  It also
enables them to energize others with enthusiasm (“in GOD”-ism), peace, and joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A great treasure awaits us.  We just need to spend some time
pursuing that treasure.  We must be willing to give up everything else in order
to obtain that treasure of superior value.  Yet when we have it, not only will
we be enriched, but so also will those around us.  Let us pray that we become
radiant with the presence of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced the enlightenment and radiance of being in a relationship with the
Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father that was truly life-changing? What were my
feelings at that time? Was it something for which I was willing to do anything
in order to experience?  What have I done to re-enlighten and re- charge myself
so that I could be open to similar experiences of the presence of GOD? How can
I radiate the experience of being in GOD’s presence to others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all relationships.  Through
Your GOoDness, You desire that all people be united with You, but You give us
free will and enable us to make choices that are opposed to a deep and personal
relationship with You.  We thank You for allowing us to freely love You, since
true love is not something forced, but a decision made.  For the times we have
placed other people and things in a higher position than our relationship with
You, we ask Your pardon and forgiveness.  May we respond to the invitation of
Your Son, Jesus, and the prompting of the Holy Spirit so that we will expend
the time and energy to make our relationship with You the number one priority
of our lives.  May the radiance You shine on us also shine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through us to others.  We make this prayer in the name of
Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Lord, Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Ignatius of Loyola:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-ignatius-of-loyola</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Exodus 40: 16-21, 34-38;        Psalm 84: 3, 4,
5-6a and 8 a, 11;         Matthew 13: 47–53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings speak about being in GOD’s presence – both
GOD’s earthly dwelling place and the eternal dwelling place.  In the First
Reading we hear about the construction of the Tent (Tabernacle) of the LORD –
GOD’s dwelling place among those who are journeying to the Promise Land.  The
Psalm declares how special it is to be able to spend time in GOD’s dwelling
place.  In the Gospel, Jesus shares a parable about those who will be welcomed
into the eternal dwelling place of GOD and those who will not be a part of
those in GOD’s eternal presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading takes place almost a year after the
Exodus.  GOD has given directions for Moses to build a tent into which the ark
with the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments could be placed.  It was the
dwelling place of GOD among the Chosen People.  Moses is pictured as not only
directing but actually performing much of the fine details of the construction
of the Tent of GOD.  [In Latin the word for “tent”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is tabernaculum from which we get the English word
tabernacle – the dwelling place of GOD, where in the Roman tradition the
Blessed Sacrament (the Body of Christ) is placed.]  Wherever</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is, that place is truly holy.  In today’s passage, the
LORD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presence is manifested in the cloud that hovers over the
Holy Place.  When the cloud lifts, the people pack up the Dwelling Place of GOD
and their own tents and move out, following the cloud as it leads them across
the desert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Psalm echoes the specialness of GOD’s dwelling place. 
It is the place to be.  People long to be in the presence of the LORD.  One day
in GOD’s presence is better than a multitude of days away from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus completes his telling of the parables
with a parable that compares the Reign of GOD to the haul of fish in a net and
a parable that speaks about the wise persons who bring out both the new and old
at the proper time. The first parable focuses on the fact that there are both
virtuous and not- so virtuous (vicious) people in the world.  At the time of
judgment, GOD (or the divine messengers -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>angels) will separate the GOoD people from the bad.  Those
who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have responded to GOD’s call will be welcomed into the
eternal dwelling place of GOD, the others will be cast out because they have
willfully chosen not to be in GOD’s presence.  The second parable is addressed
to the scribes of the Reign of GOD.  These are not just the Jewish scribes, but
especially the scribes (teachers) of early Christianity.  They are to be versed
in the old (Hebrew scriptures – the law and the prophets – the Old Testament)
and the new (Christian writings – the New Testament).  Their specialness is
seen in being able to relate the new and old. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am reminded of a not so easy
task I had been assigned.  I had to try to discern GOD’s will concerning a
friend of mine who designated me as her durable power of attorney both for
financial and also medical issues.  This friend had been in and out of hospitals
for six months.  When this individual was in ICU on life-support pumping 100%
oxygen into her lungs for over a week, I had to make a decision.  I knew she
had lived a full life of 73 years.  I also talked to her during the last six
months of her life about her readiness to go into the eternal dwelling place of
GOD in heaven.  There had been a mixture of old and new, GOoD and bad in her
life.  My faith in GOD told me that GOD was willing to welcome her in the Holy
Place of GOD’s presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I knew if she would have been able to fully recover, she
would have enjoyed living more years.  Yet GOD wanted to take her home, and she
preferred that to living in a skilled nursing home for the rest of her days,
unable to function as she had for many years, especially when she was teaching
children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings and what happened to this friend have given me
an opportunity to reflect on journeying.  Yes, I know that all of us, like the
Israelites in Exodus, are on a journey to the Promise Land.  I also have experienced
the fact that GOD is journeying with us, as GOD did with the Hebrew people of
old.  I know that we are privileged to be in GOD’s dwelling place(s) here on
earth, but that is not the final destination to which we are being led.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am grateful that I am able to journey along with other
people as we head to the eternal Promised Land.  I also realize that like the
sojourners in the desert, neither I nor others are sinless.  Yet, if our basic
orientation is ad Deum (“toward GOD”), then, thanks to the grace of GOD in
Christ Jesus, we shall not only see the Promise</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Land, but enter into it.  It is then that we will be able to
join with the psalmist today and say, “My soul yearns and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pines for the courts of the LORD. . .Blessed are they who
dwell in Your house!  Continually they praise You.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us all look forward to the day when we will be together
in the House of our Abba-Father Who happens to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When have I
experienced being in GOD’s dwelling place – the place (not necessarily a
building) where I was aware of GOD’s presence?  Did that experience lead me to
long to be in GOD’s eternal dwelling place? How can I help others yearn and
pine for the earthly and heavenly courts of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of life and presence.  Through
Your GOoDness we are given reminders of Your desire to have us be in Your
presence.  Throughout our history You have revealed Your presence in different
places that were made holy by Your dwelling there, at least for a time.  Yet
all the places that You have made holy by Your presence are but signs of the
perfect and eternal dwelling place where You reign for ever.  It is to that
Holy of Holies that we are journeying.  We thank You for giving us reminders of
Your presence not only in the holy places, but also in the people with whom You
allow us to travel, as we make our sojourn to the final place of Your infinite
and eternal dwelling.  When the time comes, give us the strength to let go of
our earthly, human dwelling so we can share in the place that You have made for
us to live eternally with Your Son, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Leviticus 23: 1, 4-11, 15-16, 27, 34b-37;    
Psalm 81: 3, 4, 5-6, 10-11ab;     Matthew 13: 54-58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings have a common thread of “remembering”
although it leads to opposite results, depending on how one is open to the hand
of GOD in the act of remembering.  In the First Reading from Leviticus, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israelites are told to remember and celebrate the key
festivals throughout the year, so that they and their descendants will never
forget what GOD has done for them, through the whole Exodus and journey to the
Promise Land.  The psalm reiterates this idea and adds the aspect of using
instruments and song to celebrate the remembering of GOD’s actions.  In the
Gospel, the people in and around Nazareth can only remember the younger Jesus,
the One Who grew up in their town and worked in a carpenter’s shop.  They have
a hard time recognizing that the preacher and healer is the same Jesus, because
their remembering is selective, and thus they are not open to the presence of
GOD in Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading deals with the Jewish calendar and its
major feasts.  From the time of Moses until the time of Jesus, the first feast
mentioned and celebrated each year was the most important feast – that of
Passover.  Following Passover (and the Feast of Unleavened Bread) was Pentecost
(“Fifty Days”) which celebrated the spring harvest and the giving of the law on
Mt. Sinai.  In the fall came the Day of Atonement and the feast of Booths
(commemorating their sinfulness and also their traveling in the desert in tents
[booths].   Most of the feasts spring from the “remembering” (zikaron) of the
experiences dealing with the Exodus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for taking care of the
Israelites</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and allowing them to celebrate their freedom from slavery. 
GOD decrees that they should not forget from where they came and thus should
always give thanks to GOD for all that GOD has done for them.  Using songs and
music adds to the joyfulness of their remembering and celebrating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus has a problem with people remembering
Him as the son of the carpenter and the young man Who grew up in the vicinity
of Nazareth and whose relatives were well known.  For those who knew</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus during His private life before He began His public
ministry, Jesus’s wisdom and doing of wonders was hard for them to fathom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering can be both productive and also destructive.  If
we remember the GOoD that has happened because of GOD’s working in our lives,
it can lead us to a sense of appreciation and thanksgiving.  If we only
remember what seems ordinary and fail to see the hand of GOD in our daily
activities, we will not be able to accept even the great signs of GOD’s
blessings when they come.  Our remembering only what once was, puts blinders on
us and we see only from the narrow perspective of our limited view of the past
and we thus fail to see how GOD is acting right now and will be acting in the
future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The correct sort of remembering involves our attitude and
our openness to GOD.  It consists in being able to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>recognize that GOD is at work in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I look back at my own life, I can see times when GOD was
touching my life in ways that has led to my drawing closer to the Lord Jesus. 
This sort of remembering involves a sense of the divine.  It is a means of
holiness coming to me.  It is a blessing from GOD.  This is the type of
remembering that GOD tells the Israelites to do as they celebrate the major
feasts throughout the year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remembering with a closed mind prevents me from experiencing
GOD’s continued action in my life.  If all I can recall is the ordinary, mundane
events of life, then I will not be aware of GOD’s presence – neither in what
has happened in the past, what is happening now, nor what will happen in the
future.  This is the type of remembering that was done by the people of
Nazareth.  They could not grasp that GOD was in their midst in the person of
Jesus.  This blocked Jesus’ bringing them the GOoD News in word and in action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I feel called to do is to be in awe as I reflect on how
GOD has touched my life, repeatedly, throughout my lifetime.  I need to
celebrate the events of my life when GOD was reaching out and touching my
life.  It means that I must be open to the fact that GOD has been with me, even
in (or maybe especially at) the most trying moments of my life.  That requires the
gift of having the eyes of faith – the ability to see beyond the ordinary and
merely human to the supernatural and divine.  If I can do that, then I will be
able to repeatedly and frequently do what today’s psalm urges me to do, even if
I have no musical talents:  “Take up a melody, and sound the timbrel, the
pleasant harp and the lyre. . .Sing with joy to GOD our Help.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I take time to
remember – to recall how GOD has touched my life or do I only remember the ordinary,
mundane experiences without seeing GOD’s action in them?  What was one of the
most awesome experiences I had of GOD touching my life? How has remembering
that event helped me be more open to GOD’s present movement?  How do I
celebrate GOD’s action in my life?  Is there anything I can do to help others
see and remember GOD’s touching of their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all history.  Through Your
GOoDness You have touched the lives of people. You call upon them to be open to
Your movement in their lives and remember those times when You have manifested
Your presence in so many ways.  You continue to touch the lives of individuals
today.  Yet, we so often fail to see Your hand at work in our daily routine. 
For the times we have failed to be aware of Your actions in our lives, we seek
Your forgiveness and healing.  Continue to pour the gifts of Your Holy Spirit
into our lives so we can remember, celebrate, and believe in Your presence in
our lives.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Who walked on earth
and continues to make our lives holy, our Brother and Savior, Who made You
present in His teaching, ministry, death and resurrection, and Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Leviticus 25: 1, 8-17;         Psalm 67: 2-3, 5,
7-8;     Matthew 14: 1-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading portrays GOD speaking through Moses to announce
the jubilee year.  In the verses omitted in today’s passage (Lev. 25: 2-7), the
LORD describes the seventh year known as a sabbatical year – a year when the
fields are not sown nor reaped in the usual way.  All the left overgrowth on
the trees and plants are to be eaten, free of charge by anyone who wants the
food.  The seventh year was to be a year of rest and renewal for the land and a
time of grace</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for the poor.  The twenty-fifth chapter of Leviticus
continues with today’s reading describing the jubilee year.  Jubilee comes from
the Hebrew word, yobel, meaning “ram’s horn,” since the horn was blown
throughout the jubilee year.  The jubilee year actually occurred every</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>49 years, since counting the last jubilee and the next
jubilee would be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>50 (a week [7] of seven years = 49).  During the jubilee
year, all property rights returned to the original owner. Anyone who had
purchased land in the years between the jubilees, in reality, rented the land
in proportion to the number of years left before the next jubilee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm praises GOD for taking care of all
the world and giving yield to the fruit of the land.  This reminds the people
that all life and growth come from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel begins by Herod wondering about Jesus.  He
wrongly believes that Jesus is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John the Baptist raised from the dead.  The rest of the
Gospel passage explains how Herod imprisoned and later beheaded John</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Baptist.  This passage may have been included in
Matthew’s Gospel to show the greater importance of Jesus over John the Baptist,
especially to those who had been followers of the Baptist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me in today’s readings is the concept of
trusting GOD and realizing that GOD is the true force behind all of life.  
Part of the concept of Sabbath, sabbatical year, and jubilee year is the
understanding that everything belongs to GOD and GOD wants us to take time to
rest and rely on GOD and GOD’s power to provide for all people.  It also speaks
to me about the importance of allowing creation to be renewed.  By not sowing
and reaping the regular harvest in one year out of seven, the land is able to
be rejuvenated.  The idea of returning all land to its original owners every
forty-nine years should also help the people realize that what they “possess”
is not really theirs, but it belongs ultimately to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these ideas, I realize how true it is that
everything is ultimately GOD’s.  Being human, we worry so much about our
possessions.  We work hard to amass things.  We think we have to do
everything.  The readings today challenge me to trust GOD more.  Yes, I have to
work 85.7% (6/7) of my waking hours, but I must rest the other 14.3% (1/7) of
the time.  [I am not really advocating being so rigid about the percentage of
time, but I am challenging myself to take the 14.3% of the time to rest, be
re-created, and trust that GOD will take care of things.  By the way that means
that just over two hours of my non-sleeping day should be devoted to re-
creating and refreshing myself through </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>entertainment, reading, prayer, and relaxation.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As many of you might know or figure out, I tend to work
maybe a little (maybe a lot) too much.  There are also others who might not
work enough.  The most important thing is that I must trust GOD and not
overextend myself.  I need to be sure that I take time to allow GOD to refresh
me.  For me, it is not that I don’t trust GOD, but, for some reason, I think I
have to keep busy and work.  The message from GOD that I am hearing today is:
“Bob, take it easy.  Learn to relax.  Be still.  I will make sure that
everything that really needs to be done, will be done, and not necessarily by
you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My response is, “But, GOD, I promised I would do this, that,
and the other thing.”  Instead of focusing so much on my overdone promises I
have made to others, I am being challenged to think about the promise I need to
make to the Lord Jesus – the promise to trust GOD above all else and to spend
time just being in GOD’s presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of my reflections on taking time with GOD was
precipitated in former years by the end of summer school and the anniversary of
the death of the friend for whom I had been caring.  What is most important is
having a relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, that my friend
has had while on earth and now has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forever.  Over the course of her going in and out of the
hospitals for the last six months of her life, she said that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>she was ready to be with the Lord Jesus forever, if that
were GOD’s will.  Yet, she also said that if GOD gave her more time on earth,
there were still a lot of things she would like to do.  She was an educator by
profession and touched the lives of thousands of students.  One of her students
ended up being one of her doctors during the last few months of her life.  She
also shared many a lesson with me, including the need to be patient, to take
time with GOD, and to be open to the Lord Jesus’ calling at the end of her
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should realize that GOD makes GOoD on the divine promises
to take care of us, not just in the heavenly reign, but here and now, if we are
willing to do our share and trust in the Lord Jesus.  I realize how GOD has
touched my life through so many other people, especially those whom I have been
privileged to serve.  My response should be that of the psalmist today:  “The earth
has yields its fruits; GOD, our GOD, has blessed us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Do I take sabbatical
time – time to rest in the LORD?  How do I allow the Lord Jesus to renew me so
that I am better able to do what GOD is asking me to do?  What can I do to
trust GOD more and realize that GOD is in charge and will see to it (i.e., GOD
is providential) that what needs to be done will be done? How can I help others
trust in GOD more?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all creation, our GOD and Abba-Father. 
Through Your GOoDness You promise to take care of us and bless us.  You ask us
to take time to allow You to work in our lives and not act as if everything
depends on what we ourselves do.  For the times we have failed to trust You and
rest in You, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  If we are the overactive
types, remind us to be still and know that You are GOD, our GOD.  If we are the
passive types who expect everyone, including You, to take care of us, motivate
us to do what You expect of us.  Let us remember as we take a vacation or
weekends off that at least part of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time we must spend properly giving You thanks and praise. 
We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our Brother, the Master-Teacher Who spent time with You to
be renewed in His ministry, and Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Peter Julian Eymard:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-peter-julian-eymard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:             Ecclesiastes 1: 2; 2:21-23;            Psalm
90: 3-4, 5-6, 12-13, 14, 17;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colossians 3: 1-5, 9-11; Luke 12: 13-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s time to take stock of ourselves.  We are challenged
today to see what our priorities are.  In the First Reading the author remarks
that life sometimes seems meaningless as people focus on their possessions and
seek to get more.  The psalmist prays that GOD will “teach us to number our
days aright.”  In the Second Reading, St. Paul addresses the Colossians (and
us) and advises that all believers “put to death the parts of you that are
earthly.”  In the Gospel, Jesus also speaks about the futility of stockpiling
things that will not be going with us as we transition from this earthly
existence to eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Qoheleth (a name which means “preacher”), the author of the
First Reading, speaks about the frustrations that many people experience in
life.  They spend all their times accumulating wealth and possessions, just to
leave them behind to others when they die. If all there is to life is material
things and amassing fortune that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will not travel along with us when we leave this mortal
existence, then life is truly meaningless.  People end up worrying themselves
to death about what they have or what they don’t have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today reflects a similar theme.  Humans get so
wrapped up in their short-life existence on earth.  Yet in GOD’s perspective,
our lifetime is but a small, minuscule moment in eternity.  We are challenged
to pray to GOD so that the LORD will help us focus our attention on what is
important (relationship to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD and doing GOD’s will – i.e., what is right) rather than
wasting our time and energy on what does not matter in the eternal picture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his letter to the people of Colossae, St. Paul also
demands his readers to seek what is above, not what is merely earthly.  Through
faith, believers have died to the mundane and risen with the Lord Jesus to the
celestial arena.  The earthly ways focus on the self – self-pleasure,
self-rewards, self-worship, whereas the spiritual ways focus on service of GOD
and others.  We are to imitate the image that Jesus has presented to us during
His earthly life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, someone, who is unhappy with the way his
sibling is handling their inheritance, asks Jesus to get involved in the
situation. Jesus uses the occasion to remind His audience that the focus is in
the wrong place.  If people are merely interested in amassing wealth and
possession, they will lose that what they treasure most when they are faced
with death.  Yet if one places value on developing a richer relationship with
GOD, then death is a transition to fulfillment of one’s searching, and one will
be rewarded far beyond one’s expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I guess it is because where I am in life (in my seventies)
that I have reflected quite a bit lately on the meaning of life.  Having lost
one of my closest friends and former classmates within the last decade or so,
and my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parents, plus other people who were younger than myself, I
have spent some time reflecting on what is the focus of my life.  Over the last
couple of years, I have had to look at the possessions that my parents left me
and my own amassed items.  I realize that I have not, like some people, been
totally caught with seeking a lot of money and possessions, but I also have not
always fully focused on my eternal inheritance.  There have been times when my
focus was on items that do not hold any eternal value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to allow the ways of the world to influence
our daily activities.  We are bombarded with messages </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>extolling the piling up of things and the search for
personal satisfaction (whether that be intellectual, monetary, physical, sexual,
or psychological).  The underlying theme of the world is, as Jesus quotes the
rich man in the Gospel, “eat, drink, and be merry” without thinking about death
and to what death leads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words of St. Paul today need to be heeded:  “Put to
death the parts of you that are earthly.”  He then lists some particular
examples of earthly lifestyles:  immorality, impurity, passion, evil desires,
and greed.  What is interesting is that he calls these idolatries, that is
worshiping of false gods.  To me he is saying:  if our values center on selfish
desires and pleasures, then we are making ourselves gods.  There is only One
Who is GOD.  If our relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father are
not our number one priority and value, then we are idolaters – we are
worshiping false gods, and our eternal inheritance will be nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At an early morning Bible study, we discussed putting Christ
in the center</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of our life.  All other things and concerns must be farther
from the center. Thanks to a friend and co-worker in Youth Ministry some 40
years ago, I am reminded of a wheel.  The center of the wheel is the hub. 
Around it turns the other parts of the wheel.  If the wheel is balanced and has
all parts circling around the hub, the wheel turns very efficiently.  If we
move the center away from the hub, the wheel will be out of balance, it will
lose its efficiency, and it can cause a very rough ride.  The more the center
shifts away from where it should be, the more bumpy the ride is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must, as St. Paul chides, put on the new self, that is
being renewed in the image of its creator.  We are not to make GOD into our
image, but we are to remember that we are to be images of GOD.  We are to
reflect the love, compassion, forgiveness, and mercy of GOD to others in order
to draw them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into a closer relationship with GOD.  We must center on GOD,
Who is the hub around which/Whom all life should turn.  If we can do that, then
we be able to enjoy the treasures of our heavenly inheritance and our ride will
be smoother as we move toward that final destination.  So let us pray with the
psalmist today and say to GOD, “teach us to number our days aright that we may
gain wisdom of heart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What priorities and
values control my life? What aspect of my old self must I again take off and
replace with the new self that is renewed in the image of its Creator? What/Who
is the center of my life? Do I need to get re-aligned and balanced by moving
Christ into the center?  Can people experience a smoother, more balanced ride
with GOD by the way I treat them with my Christ-centered attitudes?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, almighty and majestic, Creator of
all things, true inheritance of those who worship You.  Through Your GOoDness,
You have made us in Your image and after Your likeness.  You have blessed us
with all created existence.  Yet, we have often focused on Your creatures,
especially ourselves, rather than on You, the Creator of all.  We have lost the
balance in our life by moving the center away from the Lord Jesus.  For our
misguided direction and attention and lack of true focus, we seek Your
forgiveness and pardon. Help us to follow the prompting of Your Son, Jesus, Who
came as the perfect human image of Your love and compassion.  Continue to send
Your Holy Spirit upon us so that we can number our days aright and gain wisdom
of heart as we shout for joy and gladness at having You and Your Son as the hub
of our existence.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Master-Teacher and Lord, Who has died, is risen, and is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Vianney:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-vianney</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Numbers 11: 4b-15;        Psalm 81: 12-13, 14-15,
16-17;         Matthew 14: 13-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although today’s readings are from different sources, they
are similar to readings we have read and heard over the last few weeks.  The
First Reading gives another account of the Israelites complaining against GOD
because of their hunger in the desert.  The Responsorial Psalm urges the Chosen
People to turn to GOD and GOD will give them whatever they need.  In the
Gospel, Jesus ministers to the crowd by preaching and having compassion on
them.  This leads to Matthew’s account of the multiplication of the loaves and
fish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although this account from Numbers differs from the account
in Exodus, the people are still complaining about their lack of food.  They
long for the food they ate while they were slaves in Egypt.  They have not
fully learned that GOD not only provides manna, but also will meet all their
needs if they humbly come before the LORD and seek GOD’s care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm presents GOD’s response to the
Israelites complaints.  If they would come before the LORD with contrite hearts,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD would rid them from the attacks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of their enemies and give them rich food, the best wheat,
and sweet honey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus ministers to the crowds in a deserted
area.  After spending a lengthy time teaching, He sees that they need to be fed. 
With compassion, He multiplies the few loaves and a couple of fish to feed the
crowd of more than 5000.  And there is a lot of leftovers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings cause me to reflect on what our response should
be to the compassion of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is always ready to care for us in ways far beyond our
expectation, but so often we are like the Israelites of old. We complain and
want things our way.  The Gospel shows that if we listen to the Master/Teacher
and learn from Him,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He will feed us with the best of wheat, and we will have our
fill and still there will be some left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am moved by GOD’s loving
care for us and by our (at least my) failure to appreciate how active GOD is in
our daily experiences.  So often we want GOD to manifest the divine presence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>according to our understanding and desires.  We want GOD to
deliver what we want, not necessarily what we truly need or what is best for
us.  Complaining is as common to the “faithful” people today as it was to the
Israelites in the desert.  “Why, O GOD, did you let such and such happen, like
the pandemic of the past few years or political strife, or the war in Ukraine,
or climate change?”  “Why, O Lord Jesus, don’t you do what I ask?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“If You, O GOD, are really listening, then do such and such!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, if we trust that the Lord Jesus will care for us with
the compassion, as He manifested throughout His earthly existence, and that His
Abba-Father manifested to the people of the Hebrew scriptures, we will know
that GOD will provide not only what we need but even more.  GOD will multiple
what we think is so little and give </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us abundantly so that there will be a lot left over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD also often asks us to take what we have and contribute
at least the surplus to the common GOoD.  We think we have so little, but if we
are willing to give what we have, GOD will multiple it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is with us.  GOD provides for us.  The love of GOD is
manifested to us, if we but open our eyes and ears and hearts and hands, and
then GOD will fill our open and empty mouths and hands with more than we can
handle.  GOD is saying to us today as much as GOD did in the psalm, “If only My
people would hear me and. . . walk in my ways. . .I would feed them with the
best of wheat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my reaction
when things do not turn out the way I expect? Are my prayers more of complaints
to GOD or submission to GOD’s plan?  In what ways may the Lord Jesus be asking
me to trust that GOD will provide for me? How can I reassure others of the Lord
Jesus’ presence with them as they experience hunger of all sorts? What can I do
to share what I have with others so that all will know the abundant GOoDness of
our GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all kindness.  Through Your
GOoDness, we not only have our needs met, but receive even more in abundance. 
Yet, we have not always appreciated what You have provided for us and have
complained about our present circumstances.  For our lack of trust and
gratitude we seek Your forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we be willing to go away into a deserted place where we
can sit at the feet of the Master-Teacher and be ministered to by Him, both by
His Word and the gifts that He supplies.  Through the continued outpouring of
the Holy Spirit, may we be willing to share what You and Your Son give us, so
that all may experience Your compassion and love.  We make this prayer in the
name of the Lord Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the Master-Teacher Who takes
care of all of our needs, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/dedication-of-saint-mary-major-basilica/</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Numbers 12: 1-13;      Psalm 51: 3-4, 5-6ab,
6cd-7; 12-13; Matthew 14: 22-36     or      Matthew 15: 1-2, 10-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today seem to portray a tension between the
Chosen One of GOD and others who think they are as GOoD as GOD’s Chosen One. 
In the First Reading Miriam (and to a lesser extent Aaron) complain against
GOD’s giving authority only to Moses.  The psalm is a penitential prayer asking
GOD to forgive the sins of those who have turned away from GOD.  In the Gospel
Jesus walks on water and bold Peter asks to be able to do the same, but wavers
in his faith and sinks into the stormy sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Miriam seems to be jealous of her younger brother’s position
of power. She wonders why she has not been given the same authority and honor. 
She convinces Aaron to join in her disapproval of Moses’ privileged status. 
She uses the fact that Moses married Zipporah, a non-Israelite, as an excuse
why Moses should not be so blessed.  GOD shows divine ire with Miriam for
questioning the position that GOD has given to the humble and meek Moses.
Because of this sin, Miriam is subjected to “white leprosy” – a temporary
disease that causes the skin to be blanched.  It is not true leprosy, but, as
in other places in the Bible, leprosy can mean any skin malady.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is a prayer asking for GOD’s forgiveness. 
It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>recalls the fact that GOD knows our very being and our
sinfulness.  It is a call to rely on the compassion and pardon of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel takes place after Jesus feeds the crowds in the
multiplication of loaves.  Jesus sends His disciples across the Sea of Galilee
while He spends</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time alone with His Abba-Father in prayer.  As the disciples
make their way across the Sea, a storm blows in, causing them to be thrown
about in their boat.  Later (somewhere between 3 am and 6 am – the fourth watch
of the night), Jesus comes walking on the water toward the disciples.  At first
the disciples believe they are seeing things.  Even after Jesus reassures them
that it is He, Peter wants proof.  He wants to be able to walk on water just
like his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Master.  Jesus beckons him forth with the simple word, “Come.” 
At first Peter does okay.  But as he begins to sense the storm about him and
realizes that he is walking on the water, he begins to doubt, and thus sinks
into the water.  Jesus lifts him up and accompanies him to the boat at which
time Jesus then calms the tempest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I can identify with both Miriam and Peter.  I sometimes
wonder why other people seem to have all the fun and get all the breaks.  I
ponder why they are so special.  The ugly green monster, jealousy, raises its
head.  I guess it is part of human nature to want what others have, even though
GOD has blessed them in ways that I am not blessed.  I forget about the
blessings that I have received from GOD.  Like Peter, I sometimes want proof
that GOD is Who GOD says GOD is.  I want to have the privileges and skills of
the Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings are challenging for me.  They make me realize
that GOD has free reign to bestow favors on certain individuals.  My response
should not be that of jealousy, which is sinful, but rather one of gratitude
that GOD has graced certain individuals with certain abilities.  If those gifts
are used for the betterment of the whole community of faith and to give glory
to GOD, then I should do just that – give glory to GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am called to deepen my faith by realizing that the Lord
Jesus will support me with what I need in order to face the storms that toss my
life here and there.  I need to be trusting of GOD and believe that GOD knows
what is best, not only for me, but also for all concerned.  The reason Moses is
chosen is that he is humble and GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has given him gifts – and responsibilities – that others
might not be able to handle.  Jesus, as the Son of GOD, was empowered with all
the authority of His Abba-Father.  He, in turn, shows that He can share His
divine authority and power with those whom He chooses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our response to how GOD dispenses the divine favors is to
join the psalmist today, particular in the words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“A clean heart create for me, O GOD, and a steadfast spirit
renew within me.  Cast me not off from Your presence, and Your Holy Spirit take
not from me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    What has been my
attitude when others receive the adulation, gifts, and abilities that I think I
should have?  How do I handle my feelings of jealousy? Do I praise GOD for the
skills, talents, and positions of authority that GOD has given to others? In
what aspects of my life can I pray that the Lord Jesus create a clean heart?
How can I live more fully as a disciple of the Lord Jesus in my dealings with
those I encounter today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all gifts.  Through Your
GOoDness You bestow divine favors on those whom You choose, primarily for the
edifying and building up of the people You call to be Your own.  We have
sometimes envied those who have gifts we would like to have.  We sometimes wish
them harm or at least become upset that we do not have those gifts.  For our
sinful jealousy, we ask Your pardon and forgiveness.  May we look to the
Master-Teacher to bless us with the gifts that He knows we can handle and use
for the GOoD of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your faithful ones.  Through the continued guidance of the
Holy Spirit, empower us to wisely minister to others with the abilities and
talents You give us.  We make this prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus, Your
Son and our Brother, the Master-Teacher Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Transfiguration of the Lord:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/transfiguration-of-the-lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 7: 9-10, 13-14;         Psalm 97: 1-2,
5-6, 9;        2 Peter 1: 16-19;       Luke 9: 28b-36</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Transfiguration of Jesus.  The First
Reading describes the “Son of Man” coming in glory and light to the throne of
the Ancient One (the LORD GOD).  The psalm speaks of the LORD as the Ruler Who
comes in glory and power.  In the Second Reading from the Second Letter of St.
Peter, the author recalls the Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus on GOD’s holy
mountain.  It was an event that touched his life.  The Gospel is Luke’s account
of the Transfiguration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the book of Daniel, the “Son of Man” was seen as a
pre-figure of the Messiah.  In this passage, the “Son of Man” comes gloriously
into the presence of the Ancient One (GOD [the Abba-Father]).  The Son of Man
is given glory and honor and power by the Ancient One.  The Son of Man is to
issue in a new time of dedication and glory for those who follow the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today is a hymn of praise to the LORD GOD for
being the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>majestic Ruler of all, the Leader of a time of glory for all
GOD’s people.  All of creation (earthly and heavenly) come in homage before the
LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Reading is a passage</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from the Second Letter of Peter, in which the author speaks
of the glory that was revealed to Jesus’ three specially chosen disciples
(Peter, James, and John).  This experience of majesty enabled the disciples to
proclaim the GOoD News of Jesus and to look forward to His glorious Second
Coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Luke relates the account of the
Transfiguration.  It takes place on a mountain similar to the revelation of GOD
to Moses on Mt. Sinai.  Moses and Elijah symbolize the fulfillment of the Law
and the Prophets from of old.  They are a sign of the continuation of what has
been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to the time of Jesus and the future glory at the end of
time.  The whole event enables the three disciples to be able to start to put
things in perspective, but it is only after the death and resurrection of Jesus
that they really begin to understand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I studied in the Holy Land, my favorite time and place
of all was the two days I spent on Mt. Tabor, a mountain in the north of Holy
Land. This mountain is traditionally accepted as the Mountain of the
Transfiguration.  From my busy schedule as a student, this was the longest
break.  It was a time of retreat and reflection.  After riding up the twisty,
switch-back road to the top of this mount, I was able to pray and be at peace.
It was one of the only really quiet places in all of Israel.  There was no
traffic, no panhandlers nor beggars, no speakers blaring out their songs or

<p class=MsoNormal>The church on the top is beautifully constructed to take
advantage of the sun rising each morning.  It is truly a place of glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>http://www.vaspress.com/bibliya-bible/iisus-i-nazaret.html </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was able to reflect on the Transfiguration while on Mt.
Tabor and many times since.  It is interesting that three synoptic Gospels
(Matthew, Mark, and Luke) all place the Transfiguration between Peter’s
profession of faith and one of Jesus’ predications of His death.  It seems that
after Peter professed his belief in Jesus, Jesus reveals the fullness of what
it means for Him to be the Messiah, the Christ.  Jesus has come to reveal the
glory of His Abba-Father through His suffering, death, and resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To me what is striking are the parallels between the account
of the Transfiguration and some people’s near- </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>death experiences.  It is almost as if Jesus is experiencing
what will take place after His death and resurrection. He has an “out of body”
experience.  The presence of bright light leads to meeting with two of those
who had preceded Him in the eternal life journey process.  The presence of
Moses and Elijah are a confirmation for Jesus and His disciples that He is
proceeding along the faith paths of the previous individuals and leaders of
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Jesus’ Transfiguration, He – like most people who have
had a near-death experience – is even more aware of His mission in life.  He is
even more dedicated to do what His Abba-Father (Who happens to be GOD) wants
Him to do – to help people journey to the House of the Abba.  Jesus realizes
that His ministry will include suffering and death.  He may not be crazy about
dying, but Jesus has no fear of what lies beyond because He has experienced, in
His human nature, the Transfiguration that will await Him after His own death
and resurrection. The Transfiguration is also a reminder to me that if I strive
to fulfill the mission that I have received from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, that I will share in the glory of Jesus’
Transfiguration.  By being more dedicated to my calling to serve</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those around me, I can share in the majesty of Son of Man in
the presence of the Ancient One.  The feast of the Transfiguration should be a
time of renewal and rededication for all of us.  We are given a foretaste of
the magnificence that awaits us as we journey to the home of our Abba, Who
happens to be GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When I think about
the Transfiguration, what thoughts, feelings, or questions come to me?   What
do I see as the meaning of the Transfiguration for Jesus, for the three
apostles, and for me? How can I spend more time in the presence of the
glorified Lord Jesus so that I can be renewed to continue the mission that GOD
has given me?  What difference can the Transfiguration be for me as I meet
people today, this coming week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD ever empowering and always
revealing Your glory.  Through Your GOoDness, You shared with Your Son and His
disciples a glimpse of what awaits them at the end of the earthly journey of
faith.  You show Your approval and blessings upon Your Son as He continues to
fulfill Your plan for the salvation of the world.  As we celebrate the
Transfiguration of Your Son, may we be as enthusiastic as St. Peter. May we
re-dedicate ourselves to the particular ministry You have for us.  May we be
source of strength and joy to others as they travel along their paths, heading
to Your heavenly abode.  We give You, the Ancient One, all the glory and praise
and honor that is due You and Your Son, together with the Holy Spirit; for You
are the Ruler of Glory, the Majesty of Light, the Most High over all.  You,
together with Your Son and the Holy Spirit are our one and only GOD, for ever
and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Numbers 20: 1-13;         Psalm 95: 1-2, 6-7,
8-9;           Matthew 16: 13-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings describe how people respond to Who GOD is.  The
First Readings describes the contentious Israelites responding to the GOD Who
liberated them.  They are faced with having no water, and so they voice their
complaints against GOD and Moses and Aaron.  The Responsorial urges the
followers of GOD to listen to GOD when the divine Word is announced and not to
turn against GOD as the Israelites did in Meribah.  In the Gospel Jesus asks
His disciples what people were saying about Him and then He asks them a very
important question that has both personal and communal ramifications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once more the Chosen and Freed People of GOD complain
against the LORD Who had chosen them and set them free.  This takes place most
likely in the third year of the journeying in the desert, although some biblical
scholars place it in the fortieth year. They are at Kadesh in the desert of Zin
where there are only a few oases.  They are at a place where no water can be
found.  They remember how they had plenty of water to drink as they lived by
the Nile River.  Kadesh means “sacred” or “sanctified.” They cannot sense
anything sacred about the waterless place in which they find themselves. They
murmur against Aaron, Moses, and GOD.  Moses and Aaron go to the Meeting Tent
to speak to GOD.  GOD promises them water that will flow from the rock if they
strike it with the rod.  Apparently, Moses’ striking of the rock twice means he
is not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sure that GOD was going to let the water flow if he only
strikes the rock once.  GOD is upset not only with the grumbling people, but
also with Moses and Aaron for their lack of trust and their striking the rock
more than once.  The place is called Meribah which means “contention.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm builds upon the account in the First
Reading.  The psalmist urges</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the people of GOD to listen to GOD and respond with trust,
not with contention as their ancestors had at Meribah (“contention”) and Massah
(“testing” of GOD).  The true response of GOD’s people should be praise and
worship of the GOD Who is the Rock of their salvation.  For from the Rock, Who
is GOD, flows not just water (saving liquid in the dry desert), but also source
of rest and refreshment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel takes place in Caesarea Philippi, a place not far
from the Jordan River</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the northern portion of Galilee.  Jesus questions the
disciples about what they have heard people saying about Him.  They respond
that some people believe that Jesus is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John the Baptist raised from the dead, or Elijah the prophet
who was to return before the time of the Messiah, or Jeremiah, another great
prophet.  Jesus then addresses the all-important question to His disciples,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Who do you say that I am?”  Simon, soon to be renamed
Peter, speaks up.  Whether this is because he was already taken to be the
leader, or because his profession led to his becoming leader is not the key
point.  They key point is his profession of faith and the source of his
“knowledge.” He proclaims that Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of the Living
GOD.” This statement is a much stronger statement than in the parallel account
in Mark’s Gospel because it adds the phrase, “Son of the Living GOD.” According
to Peter’s words, Jesus is not just the Chosen “Anointed” One (“Messiah” or
“Christ”) of GOD, but also, He is GOD’s own Son and therefore one with GOD. 
Jesus declares the source of Peter’s declaration was not of human origin (of
flesh and blood) but of divine origin.  Peter had been gifted by GOD with the
insight of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two other sections follow Peter’s profession: Jesus’
renaming and giving authority</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to Peter and Jesus’s first prediction of His own suffering
and death.  Jesus renames the fisherman from Capernaum. Originally named Simon
bar Jonah (Simon, son of Jonah or John), Jesus now calls him Kepa, the Aramaic
word for “rock.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kepa is transliterated into Greek as Kephas or Cephas. 
Since the Greek word for “rock” is petra, the Greek name for the son of Jonah
is transliterated and changed from the feminine word petra to the masculine
form Petros or Peter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus alludes to today’s Responsorial Psalm in which GOD is
called the Rock of Salvation and to other passages</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>referring to GOD as the Rock (Psalm 18, 19, 28, 31, 42, 62,
71, 89, 92, 94, 144; and Isaiah 48: 21).  Jesus is also called the Rock or
Cornerstone (1 Corinthians 10:4; Mark 12:10; Acts 4:11; Ephesians 2:20; 1 Peter
2:6-7).  For Middle Eastern people, the rock was important in an environment of
blowing desert sand.  A rock was something firm, solid, unchanging,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and immovable. It was the structure on which buildings could
be built.  Paul describes Jesus as the cornerstone on which the foundation of
the apostles is attached.  From the foundation stones, the rest of the edifice
known as the Church (ekklesia) will be built.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus gives the Rock (or “Rocky”), formerly known as Simon
bar Jonah, the authority to open and close the gates/doors to the Reign of
GOD.  He is empowered to welcome new members and to restrict participation in
the building of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Right after Jesus affirms that He Himself is truly the
Anointed One, the Christ, the Messiah, He describes what Messiahship is all
about.  It includes His suffering and His dying.  For “Rocky,” this is too much
to handle.  He envisions the Messiah as a powerful figure Who will perform some
mighty action to free the People of GOD from the Roman rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Rocky”-Peter does not like Jesus talking about His
suffering and death.  He challenges Jesus.  In a sense Peter says, “Jesus, You
will not win people over to Your side if You talk about suffering.  You need to
give the view of power and authority.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus interprets Peter’s disclaimer as a temptation by Satan
to take the easy way out (by being a worldly power rather the more difficult
way of suffering and death).  He tells Peter to get out of His way and stop
putting stumbling blocks and temptations on His way to the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind me how often I (and probably others) try
to form my/our own image of GOD.  We want GOD to fit into our understanding of
Who we want GOD to be.  At times we may be right on target in our
understanding. We can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make bold proclamations of our faith in GOD.  Yet at other
times, we misunderstand Who GOD is and how GOD acts.  We want the Lord Jesus to
be the source of our strength, the mighty Redeemer.  We want everything to be
positive and upbeat. We become disillusioned when we face the dry and barren
times in our lives.  We wonder where the river of happiness is and why we don’t
have the refreshment we need.  We can accept the message of resurrection and
new life, but we find the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>concept of suffering and death a hard thing to swallow while
our throats are parched from the dryness in the desert of our lives.  Instead
of murmuring and having contention (Meribah) or starting to test (Massah) GOD,
we should follow the advice of the psalmist today: “Come, let us sing joyfully
to the LORD; let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.  Let us come into GOD’s
presence with thanksgiving; let us joyfully sing psalms to the LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I react when
I experience dry and barren days in my journey of faith?  Am I contentious and
testy of GOD?  Am I able to proclaim GOD as the Rock of my salvation and Jesus
as the Messiah, the Son of the Living GOD? When I proclaim the GOoD News, do I
focus more on the joy of resurrection or the pain and the suffering of the
cross? Have I been a stumbling block to the authentic proclamation of the
Gospel?  How can I be a better building block in the edifice of GOD?  What can
I do to help others accept the full Gospel of suffering and resurrection?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all life.  Through Your
GOoDness we have been given a glimpse of Your glory throughout salvation
history and particularly in the sending of Your Son to be the Messiah, the
Christ.  For the times we have tried to form You into our image instead of
letting us be formed into the image of Your Son, we seek Your pardon and
peace.  Continue to fill us with Your Holy Spirit, so we can boldly and
accurately proclaim that You are our Rock of salvation, and that Your Son,
Jesus, is the cornerstone on which Peter (“Rocky”) and the other apostles are
laid as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>foundation of Your Church.  May we be faithful building
blocks in the edifice that continues to be built for Your glory and honor.  We
make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Lord,
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

14-15, 16 and 21;       Matthew 16: 24-28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The glory of the LORD can be seen in what GOD has done and
allowed to be done in the holy name of the LORD.  In the First Reading, Moses
addresses the Israelites and asks if there has ever been reports similar to
those describing what the LORD GOD has done for the Chosen People.  The psalm
is a prayer of zikaron – remembrance – of all the glorious and magnanimous
actions performed by GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus informs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His disciples that the way to experience the glory of GOD is
through self-denial, carrying one’s cross, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>following Him, the Master-Teacher, our Lord Jesus the
Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the passage from Deuteronomy, Moses asks the Chosen
People if they have ever known of wondrous deeds done, that have been related
by any other people, similar to those performed by the LORD GOD for the
Israelites.  In asking this question, Moses was seeking to evoke a response
that GOD is truly awesome and should be obeyed, worshiped, and loved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial reminds us that if we pause and reflect on
the deeds of the LORD, our response can be nothing less than thanks and praise
that should be given to GOD.  It is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD who set the Israelites free by directing Moses and Aaron
to care for them.  Moses and Aaron were only reflections of the glory of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following the announcement that what it means for Jesus to
be the Messiah is to suffer, die, and rise again, Jesus today instructs His
disciples that if they would really be that – His disciples – then they will
have to do three</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things:  1) deny their very selves; 2) take up their crosses;
and 3) follow Him.  If they do this, they will see the Son of Man (Jesus
Himself) come in glory both at the time of His resurrection and at the end of
time.  Not only will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they see Jesus’ glory, but also, they will actually become
participants in His glorious Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings, especially the Gospel, lead me to realize how
important it is share in the glory of the Lord Jesus. Yet sharing in the glory
also includes being willing to suffer.  The three conditions for a disciple are
as valid for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us today as it was at the time Jesus walked on the earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Denying oneself [ἀπαρνέομαι (aparneomai)] means a total
disowning of one’s very being.  It means that one belongs to another
(disciple), in this case, to Jesus.  It implies that one’s first thought should
always be how any action will further the cause of the Lord Jesus.  It is a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>total dedication to being one of the Lord Jesus’ disciplined
followers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taking up one’s cross is much more than wearing a golden
chain with a golden cross around one’s neck.  In ancient times, the cross was a
means of execution.  The pain involved in crucifixion was unbearable, or quite
literally excruciating (ex – from; crucis – the cross).  Thus, carrying one’s
cross means that one is willing to lay down one’s life for the sake of the
Master and His beliefs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following Jesus demands imitating the Master in every aspect
of life (and death).  It involves doing everything that He did.  It is being
able to be known as one of the Master’s apprentices because one’s actions and
words reflects that Master’s action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the ancient practice of a master and
apprentices.  When individuals wanted to learn a particular trade or skill,
they would go to a master-craftsperson.  The master would not give the
apprentice/ student a how-to book.  The master would demonstrate the craft. 
The apprentice would watch and try to imitate the master.  Not only would the
apprentice spend a few hours with the master each day, but the learner would
live, and share life, with the master.  After years of apprenticeship, the
student would produce a work that very much resembled the master’s art.  In
fact, when the apprentice would show the work to others, people would often
remark, “I am not sure who you are, but I know who your master is, because your
work reflects your master and his glory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is only when we are willing to fully participate, to sit
with the Master and watch what He does, and be emerged completely in the life,
ministry, suffering, and death of Jesus, that we will be able to experience the
fullness of the glory of His resurrection.  The glory of GOD has been
manifested in Jesus’ death and resurrection, and it will come to its
fulfillment at the time of Jesus’ coming at the end of time.  What will allow a
person to share in that glory will be how well one reflects the Master in one’s
life and the way one treats others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Would that someday someone say to me, “I don’t know who you
are, but I know who your Master is, because your work reflects the glory of
Jesus – the Master-Teacher.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do people
immediately know Who my Master- Teacher is, simply by the way I lead my life?
Does my life give glory to the Master-Teacher and His Abba-Father? How can I
spend more time sitting at the Master’s feet and learning from Him?  Who might
benefit most from my reaching out and touching their lives in the name of the
Master? How can I more fully dedicate myself to the cause of the Master?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all glory.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have a share in Your glory and the glory of Your Son, Jesus.  He
came to reflect Your glory in all His words and deeds.  He continually pointed
to You as He reached out and touched people’s lives.  I thank You for Your
Son’s invitation to be His disciple.  I know that I have not always reflected
the glory of my Master.  I have sometime sought my own glory.  Continue to help
me to deny myself, take up the cross, and follow Your Son wherever He may
lead.  And may I someday be able to experience the fullness of Your glory. 
This prayer is made in the name of Your Son, Jesus, my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Master-Teacher and Lord, Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith has many aspects.  Faith involves remembering, loving,
and acting.  In our First Reading, Moses delivers what is known as the Shemah,
Israel which is one of the keystones of the Jewish faith.  The Responsorial is
a prayer of praise of GOD for being the source and strength of faith.  In the
Gospel, Jesus performs a miracle that the disciples were not able to do because
of their weak faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, Moses addresses the Children of Israel
telling</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them to hear and remember what GOD has done.  He continues
by urging them to reflect on how they are to respond to GOD’s action. First and
foremost, they must love the LORD, their GOD with their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whole heart, soul, and strength.  They are to be reminded of
this duty by posting the Shemah, Israel (“Hear, O Israel”) prayer on their
bodies</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and around their doors.  They should say the prayer
frequently and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reverently.  As they do so, they should also recall that GOD
is the One Who is bringing them to the Promised Land where they will inherit
bounty and benefits that they did not work for or earn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today is a prayer addressed to GOD as strength,
rock, fortress, and deliverer.  It is GOD Who has bestowed abundant love upon
the Chosen People.  In return the only fitting response is to give thanks
(berekah) and praise (hallel) to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, a man approaches Jesus asking Him to heal his
son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The son seems to be suffering from some sort of
mental/spiritual abnormalities.  The father mentions that he has already sought
the help</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Jesus’ disciples, but they were not able to help the
son.  Jesus first addresses those standing around mentioning their lack of faith. 
He then casts out the evil (non-salus) from the son.  Later, in private, the
disciples question Jesus about their inefficiency in helping the son.  Jesus
responds by saying their faith is not strong enough, at least not yet.  He
remarks that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with greater faith, nothing will be impossible for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder the readings, I realize that the source and
power of faith originates with GOD.  GOD is the One Who provides the strength
and the wherewithal to persevere.  In order to have one’s faith grow, one must
constantly recall all that GOD has done and then love GOD with every aspect of
one’s life – one’s heart, soul, and strength (that is, emotionally,
spiritually, and physically).  One way to make GOD ever present in one’s life
is to have little reminders of GOD’s greatness, similar to the Jewish custom of
putting the scriptural reminders in their headbands and bracelets</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and around the doors of their homes.  Some Christians use
the Sign of the Cross, blessing themselves and calling upon the name of the Triune
GOD, all as a means of remembering the key beliefs of Christianity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also realize that faith, as the source of strength in
one’s life, can be enhanced and deepened so that one can be an even better
instrument of GOD’s healing to others.  Faith is an on-going process that must
be ever on the mind of the faithful.  With faith and trust in GOD, great things
can happen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember hearing on a radio show, that when a person seeks
healing from GOD and it does not happen, it does not always mean that there is
a lack of faith.  Part of being a person of faith is being able to accept that
GOD does not always grant the prayers of people because it is not what is best
for those involved (and therefore not according to the divine will of GOD). 
Yes, GOD does hear and respond to every faith-filled prayer, but GOD does not
always respond in the way that the praying individuals request.  GOD always
responds in a way that is best for the deepening of faith in the situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My response to my reflection is first of all to admit that I
am not as faith-filled an individual as I could be.  It is not that GOD has not
given me the opportunities to grow in faith, but I have not always remembered
that GOD is the source of faith and strength.  I have also sometimes asked for
things that were not the best for myself or others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My response to the gift of faith, that GOD is continually
deepening within me, is to seek GOD’s will in all things – including salus
(healing, wholeness, holiness, salvation).  It also demands that I give GOD all
the glory, praise, thanks, and love that I possibly can – emotionally,
physically, and spiritual.  Thus, I can pray the words of today’s psalm:  “I
love You, O LORD, my strength; O LORD, my rock, my fortress, my deliverer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I seek to love
GOD with my whole being (spiritually, emotionally, and physically)?   Is there
a way to post or make little reminders of my faith so that I can recall GOD’s
graciousness and kindness to me? Am I open to the way GOD responds to my
prayer, especially when I do not always get that for which I pray? How can I
help others recall the actions of GOD in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all GOoD gifts.  Through Your
GOoDness we have received faith.  You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are the source and origin of our faith.  You continually
remind us of Your loving gift of faith through the events of our lives.  You
ask us to pray confidently in faith and always seek Your will above all else. 
Sometimes we have failed to appreciate and use the faith You have bestowed on
us.  At other times we have been misguided in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our faith relationship with You, demanding things that were
not according to Your plan for our GOoD.  We seek Your pardon and peace.  Help
us to be faithful disciples of Your Son, Jesus, and to sit at His feet and
learn from Him Who is the Master-Teacher.  Continue to fill us with Your Holy
Spirit so that we can wisely and lovingly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>live and share the faith You have given us.  We make this
prayer in and through Your Son, Jesus, Who is our Brother and Master-Teacher,
and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Wisdom 18: 6-9;   Psalm 33: 1, 12, 18-19,
20-22;    Hebrews 11: 1-2, 8-19;    Luke 12: 32-48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are reminded today of various aspects of faith. The First
Reading describes the faith that the patriarchs and the Israelites have had — a
faith in the promise that they will be set free from their enslavement in
Egypt. The psalm is a prayer of faithful believers who realize that they are
blessed because they have been chosen by GOD. The Letter to the Hebrews is a
review of part of Hebrew scriptures and shows how the faith of Abraham moved
him to follow GOD’s command, even though he did not understand all the
ramifications of his actions. In the Gospel, Jesus uses parables to highlight
another aspect of faith – the importance of being prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from the Book of Wisdom relates the faith that
Abraham and his descendants have had. GOD has promised that the children of Israel
will possess the Promised Land. Even while being slaves in Egypt, and later,
exiles in Babylon, or under Greek and Roman oppression, the Israelites believe
that GOD will make GOoD on the divine promises. Their faith gives them hope
while they await GOD’s deliverance of them, allowing them to return to the Land
of Promise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist recalls that GOD has chosen the people to be
the people of divine inheritance. Because GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promised to do GOoD for the Chosen People, they can wait for
the LORD with faith and hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The selection from the Letter to the Hebrews describes
faith, not so much in the sense of theological definition, but by using the
example from the life of Abraham. Abraham is truly the Father of Faith in the
sense that he is the first</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to completely trust in GOD’s promises. Abraham is willing to
forsake his homeland and move out to a new land. He believes GOD’s promise that
not only will he possess a land of promise, but that he will have many
descendants who will live in the land. That takes a lot of faith on Abraham’s
part, especially as he owns no land and he grows older without a child being
born from his apparently barren wife, Sarah. And even after the aged couple
give birth to Isaac, Abraham trusts in GOD when he is asked to sacrifice his
son, Isaac, the one through whom he is to have many descendants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus teaches about the need for preparedness
as His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples wait for the fulfillment of the Reign of GOD. They
have been promised a place in the future Reign of Heaven, but in the meantime,
they must act as if the Reign will be coming immediately, and in fact is
already here. They are to live in the “already but not yet.” They are “already”
part of the Reign of GOD right now and must act accordingly,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>even if they do “not yet” fully experience the totality of
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the reading, I am reminded of a phrase I use
when I am working on youth retreats: “Participate, don’t anticipate!” The
retreatants always wanted to know what was in store for them. The retreat team
had promised them that they would have a special experience while on the
retreat. Some of the youth wanted to know what was going to happen next. We had
to reassure them that they were already a part of the process of what was going
to happen, and they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should not anticipate what was going to happen, but just
participate in what was happening right then, for their whole time on retreat
was part of the process of the experience we had promised them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In life, we believers are anxious about the promises GOD has
made to us. We believe in what the Lord Jesus has told us about the Reign of
GOD, but we want to know the details of what is going to happen next. We
anticipate the future without participating in the present. We want the Master
to return, but we don’t want to have to prepare for His return by doing what is
expected of us right now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith, as the author of the Letter to the Hebrews writes, is
“the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen” (Hebrews
11: 1). It means we live in the “already, but not yet” Reign of GOD. We have
the confidence (literally “with faith”) to fully be in the present moment while
we know that there is still more GOD will be giving us in the future. We are
part of the process of GOD renewing the world right now as we proclaim the GOoD
News to those around us by the way we live our lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, like Abraham, move forward, not knowing all the details
of how GOD is going to work it out, but we are sure that GOD has a plan for us,
a plan that we do not fully comprehend at this point in our lives. We live with
the assurance that GOD is going to work it out as we participate in what GOD is
asking us to do right here and right now. We live as members of the Reign of
GOD that is “already but not yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way of saying this is that we fully engage ourselves
in witnessing the coming Reign of GOD by our acts of service to others without
worrying about all the details of how GOD is going to bring it about. We
completely give ourselves to the spread of the GOoD News and trust that GOD
will give us what we need on a “need to know” basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another comparison comes to mind. In the planning for D-Day
in World War II, the Allied soldiers knew that something big was going to
happen. They did not know exactly all the details and they were not told when
it would happen. They trained and they had to be ready for the time when the
orders would be given. Even when the orders to move out were given, they were
not given all the details. They had to go forward with faith in the plan that
had been worked out by those in authority. Some of them “knew” that they would
probably have to suffer and even die, but they were willing to commit
themselves to the plan, even though they did not know fully what the plan was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is asking us to commit ourselves – our whole mind, our
whole body, our whole soul – to the divine plan. GOD has promised us the
ultimate victory and being part of the eternal Reign. All we need to do is
prepare ourselves and do what we must do right here and right now. We should
not worry and anxiously anticipate what is ahead of us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on our way to the final end, but we should be willing to do
what is asked of us right now – proclaim the GOoD News to those who are around
us and live out our call as disciples of the Lord Jesus. We must fully
participate in the “already” part of the Reign of GOD and not anxiously
anticipate the “not yet” aspect of the Reign of GOD. That is what faith is.
That is the faith we are called to profess by our very existence. That is the
faith that our GOD has given to us, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD will fulfill according to the promises made in and
through Jesus. Let us, together with the psalmist, proclaim: “Blessed are the
people the LORD has chosen to be [GOD’s] own!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How do I live a
faith-filled life? Do I overly anticipate with undue anxiety what lies ahead? 
Do I participate as fully as possible to bring about the Reign of GOD? In what
ways can I be a more active participant in the process of bringing about the
“already, but not yet” Reign of GOD. How can I help bolster the faith of those
with whom I journey on the path toward the Reign of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, fulfiller of the promises You
have made. Through Your GOoDness, You give the gift of faith to Your people and
ask them to respond by following Your plan. You have sent Your Son, Jesus, as
the model of being faithful to Your plan. He lived, ministered, suffered, and
died so that Your Reign could be brought about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He invited His followers to be a part of the process of
announcing the Reign of Heaven that was already with them but not yet fully
realized until His return at the end of time. For the times we have failed to
participate in the process of living out Your plan, we seek Your pardon and
forgiveness. Continue to empower us by the presence of Your Holy Spirit so that
we can fully commit ourselves to Your Reign, even when we do not know all the
details. We look</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forward to the ultimate celebration that Jesus has prepared
for us through His suffering, death, and resurrection, and it is in His name
that we lift up this prayer of praise and thanks to You, for He is our
Master-Teacher, Lord and Savior, and He is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Deuteronomy 10: 12-22;        Psalm 147: 12-13,
14-15, 19-20;        Matthew 17: 22-27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wisdom of GOD again refutes the ways of mortals.  In the
First Reading, the words of Moses urge the Israelites to recall (remember -
zikaron) the great deeds GOD has done for them and to turn to the LORD instead
of being stiff-necked.  The psalmist urges the people to realize that no other
GOD has done for any people what the LORD GOD has done for the Chosen People. 
In the Gospel, Jesus again predicts His death and it leads to confusion.  Jesus
also shows His wisdom and understanding concerning taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Israelites continue their journey in the desert.  Moses
tells the people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that they have not always been open to GOD’s gifts, and they
have hardened their hearts to GOD’s movement.  They need to circumcise their
hearts – that is, be open to what GOD has done and is doing for them.  If they
reflect on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blessings they have received from GOD, they will be able to
continue to receive GOD’s favor.  In their remembering, they are told to recall
(zikaron) they were once aliens, and so they should treat aliens with care and
compassion.  This is something we should remember also as we encounter aliens
(foreigners)in our midst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm builds upon the message of the First Reading.  In
pondering the way</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has dealt with the Chosen People, they will realize that
no other nations have been as loved and cared for as they have been in GOD’s
relationship with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus’ continued message of His impending
death is met with confusion and disbelief by His disciples.  They cannot grasp
that GOD’s plan could include the death of Jesus.  They are still thinking that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, as the Messiah, was going to manifest some sort of political
power,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>freeing people from their oppression by Rome.  Jesus tries
to help them to understand that GOD’s love will be manifested by His suffering
and death – and resurrection.  To show that GOD can make GOoD come from
something apparently negative, He allows</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Simon-Peter to catch a fish to pay the temple taxes.  Again,
Jesus’ wisdom and activity surpasses even His disciples’ grasp of what is
happening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am also thinking about some
events in my life over the last few years.  I am being forced to think about
earthly life, death, and what comes after death.  With the deaths of close
friends and my father two decades ago, I realize that human life does not last
forever.  As I continue to age and draw closer to my own death, death can seem
like such a finality.  Yet, with the open eyes of faith, I am understanding
better that death is a transition to something even greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I, like the Israelites in the First Reading and the
disciples in the Gospel, sometimes cannot fathom the realities that GOD is
trying to teach.  I need to look beyond my own personal desert experience and
the trying events in my life to see how GOD may be moving in the lives of those
whom I care about (including me).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ followers were only able to see His soon-to-be death
as a tragic event, inconceivable in their understanding of the Messiah.  Jesus
wanted them to try to understand that His death would bring about salvation and
a closer relationship between His Abba-Father and His disciples.  His conversation
concerning paying taxes and His allowing Simon-Peter to catch a fish with tax
money within its mouth showed that GOD has control of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>everything and will make all things work out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may not fully understand all of GOD’s actions.  It may
take looking backward (not just now but in eternity) to see the greatness of
GOD’s plan.  What we need to do right now is to follow the words of the
psalmist and “Glorify the LORD. . .praise your GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  In what areas of my
life have I failed to try to understand the movement of GOD?   What is my
response when I contemplate the greatness and graciousness of GOD, as GOD acts
in my life? What can I do to bolster the faith of those who are struggling with
their understanding of Who GOD is in their lives and how GOD is acting in their
everyday experiences?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all GOoDness.  Through Your
kindness, we have been blessed with earthly existence and the promise of
eternal existence with You, if we but open our minds and hearts to You.  For
the times we have closed our understanding to Your plan for our lives and the
lives of those for whom we care, we seek Your forgiveness and healing.  Through
the power and inspiration of Your Holy Spirit, open our minds to what You would
have us know so that we can continue our journey to You.  We make this prayer
in the name of the Lord Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Deuteronomy 31: 1-8;        Deuteronomy 32:
3-4ab, 7, 8, 9 and 12;      Matthew 18: 1-5, 10, 12-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD cares for us more than we can ever imagine.  Our First Reading
relates that before his death, Moses gives his final message of hope and
encouragement to the Israelites, in which he asks them to remember that GOD has
great plans for the people.  The Responsorial is a continued part of Moses’
urging the people to accept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the plan of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about the need
to be humble and open as young children, for those who have those child-like
qualities will experience GOD’s greatness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the reading from Deuteronomy, Moses, the leader of the
Chosen People for the last forty years, speaks his last words to the children
of Israel.  He reminds them to realize it was not he (Moses) who led them and
saved them, but it was the LORD Who was and is the only true Leader.  He also
asks them to realize that GOD’s leadership will be seen in Joshua.  Moses also
urges Joshua to follow the direction GOD gives to him for the sake of the
people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial continues with more of Moses’ words of
encouragement and admonition for the people of GOD.  Those who are too young to
recall all the events of the last forty years in the desert are to go to their
parents and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have their parents relate how the LORD GOD was the real
Leader Who brought the people out of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the slavery in Egypt and protected them during their desert
journey.  It is also GOD who will lead the people into the Promise Land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus brings a child before His disciples and
praise the openness and accepting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ways of children.  He also tells His followers that they
need to humble themselves and put aside the pretenses of being too
sophisticated to have the simple faith of a child.  He shares the message of
the shepherd who will leave the ninety-nine sheep and will go in search for the
lost sheep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The LORD GOD truly cares for us.  Even more than the fact
that the LORD provides evidence of divine love for the people of Israel, GOD
has poured out signs of love for all people in and through the ministry of
Jesus.  Jesus, the GOoD Shepherd, will go out in search of us when we wander
away from the safety of the flock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of a movie I once saw about a
less-than-exemplar student who went with his class to the San Diego Zoo. 
Before the students climbed off the bus, the bus driver warned all of the
students to stay together. As the group was led through the zoo, the boy became
mesmerized by a helium balloon that drifted through the zoo.  He followed the
balloon, that led him away from his class.  At the end of the day at the zoo,
the bus-driver checked the students back on the bus for their ride back to
school.  He realized that the boy was not there.  The bus driver left all the
kids in the safety of the bus and went in search of the wayward boy, who by
this time was</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>worried, scared, and sad.  In the end, the bus driver found
the boy and lovingly carried him back to the bus where all were reunited and
filled with joy at the lost being found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At times we are like the boy who follows the wind-blown
balloon instead of staying where we should be, with the group.  We forget what
we have been told about staying on the right path and sticking together with
those who are going the right way.  GOD, like the bus driver (or GOoD
Shepherd), will not leave us alone when we are </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>scared, lost, and saddened.  GOD continues to search us out
and bring us back to the safety of the group, who will rejoice when we are
returned safely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us realize that the Lord Jesus is our Leader and will
continue to search for us when we have traveled off the right path.  Let us
realize, as the Responsorial verses say today, “The LORD alone was their
leader, no strange GOD was with them.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced being lost in my following the ways of the Lord Jesus? What
thoughts and feelings did I experience? How did I come to realization that GOD
was searching for me? Who was instrumental in helping bring me back? What can I
do to help others who may be lost in their path to GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all love and protection. 
Through Your GOoDness, we are never beyond Your love and care.  Even when we
have wandered far from the way You have set out before us, You search us out
and bring us back to Your presence.  We can never give You enough thanks and
praise for all You do in our lives.  We thank You for sending us Your Son,
Jesus, Who truly is the GOoD Shepherd Who has come to gathered the lost sheep
and bring them back to You.  For the times we have strayed, we seek Your pardon
and forgiveness.  May we give You all the glory, praise, and honor that is due
You, in and through Your Son, our Savior and Brother, Who draws us ever closer
to You, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Deuteronomy 34: 1-12;    Psalm 66: 1-3a; 5 and 8,
16-17;     Matthew 18: 15-20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like the Israelites journeying in the desert, we are part of
a group heading to the land of promise. Today’s First Reading takes place near
the very end of the Israelites’ sojourn through the desert at a time in which
they (without Moses) will experience the presence of GOD leading them into the
Promise Land. The Responsorial is an exhortation to the people to praise GOD
for the wonderful things GOD has done, is doing, and will continue to do as the
divine promises are fulfilled. In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about the role of
the community of the faithful in the fulfillment of GOD’s promises to bring
salvation to the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We come to the end of the Torah – the “Law” – also known as
the Pentateuch or the first “five books” of the Bible. Today’s passage
describes the fulfilment of the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. GOD
is about to bring the Chosen People into the Promise Land – but without Moses.
Moses, the esteemed spokesperson for GOD, is able to see the Promise Land but
will not enter into it. After the traditional thirty-day mourning period,
Joshua takes control of the Israelites and prepares them for their crossing of
the Jordan River and entrance into the land flowing with milk and honey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for all that GOD has
done for the Chosen People. It is appropriate as we conclude the Torah or Books
of Moses. The prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>could have been said by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moses as he looked across</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Jordan River and saw the land toward which he had been
leading the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus gives specific instructions on how a
wayward member of the faithful was to be handled. First, the injured party was
to make a personal appeal to the erring person. If that did not work, then a group
of two or three others would be called in as witnesses in the process. If the
person at fault still did not repent (turn his/her ways around), then the whole
Church (faith community) would be involved even to the point of excluding the
sinner</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from the midst of the assembly. Jesus ends this pericope
with the promise that there is power when two or more believers gather together
and pray – for Jesus is in their midst as partner (chief partner) in the
prayer. [Pericope from the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Greek meaning to “cut around,” thus it means a “cut around”
passage from scripture often used in liturgical services; an excerpt.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am reminded of the
purpose of a community of faith. It is multi-purposed in its goals: 1) to be
the recipients of the promises made by GOD; 2) to give witness to, and to help,
the wayward; 3) to be united in prayer for the GOoD of the rest of the group. I
am conscious of the fact that GOD wants a personal relationship with each and
every individual, but the Lord Jesus aids in that process by means of the faith
community. The purpose of the Church is to give collective praise to GOD for
all the divine deeds, that have happened in the past, are happening now, or
will take place in the future. It is by the sharing of the story of salvation
among a group of people that GOD has continued the process of revelation.
Scripture, the Word of GOD, was meant to be shared within a communal gathering.
As the assembly gathers in the name of GOD, they hear how GOD has dealt with
the people from the time of first humans forward. The gathering of people also
gives rise to singing and celebrating GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church (faith community) is also commissioned to be the
final word on matters of unfaithfulness and sinners who refuse to repent. All
sin has some communal effects. Even those evil deeds done alone in darkness
cause the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>body of believers to be weakened. The members of a faith
community must take action to help the wayward to get back on the right path.
If personal pleas to the wrong-doer do not have an effect, a small, less formal
group of individuals can try to influence the sinner to make adjustments to
his/her life. Although it was not mentioned directly in these verses concerning
correction, the importance of prayer is critical and comes in the following
verses. I have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>known of a group of church people who acted without the
benefit of prayer and tried to “correct” an erring individual. If it was not
done with prayer, then it could lead to judgmental verdicts that may not always
be of the Lord Jesus and could be harmful to all involved and to the whole
community. The last resort in helping a fallen comrade to pick himself/herself
up is the action of the whole community, even if that means banning the
individual from participation in the group until she/he turns around and heads
back to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The final role of the community of believers is that of
prayer. When two or more of the faithful gather in Jesus’ name, He is present
with them. A key aspect of that is that they gather in Jesus’ name, that is,
they seek to do the will of Jesus and His Abba-Father. The purpose should
always be for the edification (building up) of the community and its individual
participants. The focus of prayer should center on being able to give thanks to
GOD for what the Lord Jesus is doing in their midst, in order to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>further the GOoD News. It is not meant to be some magical
incantation that forces GOD to do what is being requested. The prayer should
enable the pray-ers (those who are praying) to accept GOD’s will in the
situation about which they pray. They should sense the presence of the Lord
Jesus and be led by the discernment of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having been a part of a few, very faith-filled communities
in my life, I can vouch for the power that is evident as individuals unite to
further the spread of the Gospel. It would be great if we could always be a
part of such groups, but since we are still on this side of heaven, we can only
get a foretaste of the glory that will be in the future when GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will bring all of the divine promises to complete
fulfillment. It is almost as if we are with Moses on the top of the mountain as
he looked across the Jordan Valley and sees the land of promise, the land into
which his people are about to enter. We can only strive to do what we can to
let others know about, and experience, GOD’s presence among us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It should lead us to give greater glory and praise to GOD.
Hopefully, our hymn of praise will echo that of the psalmist today when he
says, “Come and see the works of GOD, GOD’s tremendous deeds among the children
of Adam. Bless our GOD, you peoples; loudly sound GOD’s praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my
experience in being part of a community of faith?  Have I sensed the
fulfillment of some of the promises of GOD as I have been with other believers?
Has the community been helpful to me and other sinners so that we could turn
back to the right path? Have I experienced the power of the prayer of a
community who seeks to do the Lord Jesus’ will? What can I do to help others
have a better sense of the function of a faith community in edifying and
building up the Church (the body of believers)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all that is GOoD. Through
Your GOoDness we are invited to be part of community of faith. It is in such a
gathering of Your people that we can hear the stories of Your marvelous deeds.
It is there that we can be supported and strengthened as we continue our
journey of faith. It is there that we can have a glimpse of the fulfilment of Your
glorious promises. We seek Your forgiveness for the times we have failed the
community through our sinfulness. Continue to pour out Your Holy Spirit and
help us to be aware of the presence of Your Son, Jesus, as we gather in His
name and seek to do Your will. May we give You all the glory, praise, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>honor that is due You, in and through Your Son, our Savior
and Brother, Who draws us ever closer to You, and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-maximilian-mary-kolbe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Joshua 3: 7-10a, 11, 13-17;        Psalm 114:
1-2, 3-4; 5-6;         Matthew 18: 21 –  19: 1</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is generous and forgiving, performing great signs so
that more people will come to put their faith in the LORD GOD.  In the First
Reading, as the Israelites are led into the Jordan River by the priests
carrying the Ark of the Covenant, the waters of the rushing river cease so that
the Chosen People can cross through the riverbed on dry land.  The psalm recalls
not only this parting of the water but also that of the Sea at the time of the
Exodus from Egypt and gives praise to GOD for the divine deeds done for the
people whom GOD has chosen.  In the Gospel, in response to a question by Peter
about forgiveness, Jesus tells the parable of the unforgiving servant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading takes place when the Israelites have
finally finished their journey in the desert and are about to cross into the
Promise Land. The only thing (and a mighty thing at that) preventing them from
entering the “land flowing with milk and honey” is the mightily flowing Jordan
River.  And at the time of year (spring) in which they are about to cross, the
Jordan is even more mighty than at other times due to the spring rains and the
melting snows that feed the Jordan and its tributaries.  Yet, as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has promised, as soon as the priests bearing the Ark
start to step into the rushing river, the water stops flowing and the riverbed
dries out.  In a parallel event to the parting of the Sea at the beginning of
their journey out of Egypt, GOD has demonstrated Who is in control, even of
natural phenomena.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm recalls the two water events at each end of the
Exodus experience.  GOD is able to overcome the natural events of water
flowing.  Water, which can be a source of disaster and an obstacle to travel,
is the means through which GOD saves the people and which are answerable
ultimately only to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, bold Peter wants to show that he is
righteous.  He asks Jesus if he forgives a fellow member of the family of GOD
seven times is he not being a righteous person.  The Jews held that one should
forgive another three times.  Peter doubles the number and adds one (1) to make
it seven times.  The number seven signifies a perfect number, thus Peter is
questioning, if he perfectly forgives the one who has wronged him, isn’t that
enough.  Jesus remarks by using the number seventy-seven, an even more perfect</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>number, that signifies unlimitedness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Gospel pericope continues in the related parable, in
which Jesus relates the parable of the servant who owes his master (a king) an
enormous amount of money.  Upon being begged for understanding, the master not
only gives understanding to the debtor, but a complete wiping away of the
debt.  The forgiven servant then meets a fellow servant who owes a mere
pittance to him.  Even though the lesser debtor pleads for understanding and a
little more time to repay his loan, the already forgiven servant will hear
nothing of it and sends his debtor to jail until he repays the whole (measly)
amount.  Obviously aware of how the first</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>servant had been released from his debt, his fellow servants
report the incident to the master.  Rightly, the master is furious that the
reprieved servant had not dealt as kindly toward a debtor as he</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>had been treated.  He calls in the unforgiving servant and
re-institutes the loan that will not be payable in the servant’s lifetime, thus
sentencing him to the permanent imprisonment that he deserves. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings speak not only of GOD’s mighty acts of saving
the Chosen People by means of going through waterways, but also of GOD’s
forgiveness.  Thus, two of the sacraments of the church are alluded to in
today’s readings.  GOD uses signs and symbols to demonstrate the overpowering
love that the LORD has for those who are called and chosen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sacrament of Baptism with its water imagery is typified
in the Exodus water events.  Just as the Chosen People are facing death by
water, or at least a hindrance from their passage to new life, the same death-producing
water turns into be the avenue through which GOD brings them to safety and the
Promise Land and destroys that which is evil in their past – a new life is
born.  So also in Baptism, the old, sinful life is destroyed by water and new
life is given as one emerges from the water with a new life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In regard to the Sacrament of Reconciliation, we are
reminded in the Gospel that GOD is willing to write off our whole, enormously
large debt of sin.  Yet, in turn, the Lord Jesus expects us to deal as mercifully
with those who offend us.  In the frequently prayed “Lord’s Prayer” we ask GOD
to forgive us as we forgive those who wrong us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge for me today is to live up to the new life I
have received through the waters of Baptism (even if</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that Baptism took place many years ago).  I have crossed
through the water and been led to the Promise Land. My response needs to be one
of gratitude and remembrance for what GOD has done for me.  Secondly, I must be
willing to put into actions the words that I have prayed many times each day,
“as we forgive those who trespass against us.”  It is easy, and almost
presumptuous, to expect GOD to pardon me.  It is much more difficult for me to
be as understanding and forgiving of those who wrong me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember hearing about a brother and sister who were
constantly fighting with each other.  Their mother</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>finally pulled the older sister aside and related today’s
Gospel about forgiving seventy-seven times.  The girl took to heart her
mother’s admonition.  For days upon days, peace settled into the household
relationships.  After</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>quite a lengthy time of the older sister being willing to
put aside the teasing and even hitting by the younger brother, one day the
mother saw the older sibling get pushed to the limit as the girl took a swing
at her younger brother.  The mother asked her daughter, “Why did you not treat
your brother as you have been for the last few months.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The daughter responded, “That was the seventy-eighth time he
bugged me!”  Her “keeping count” missed the point Jesus spoke of as He told
about being willing to always forgive.  We need to recall the parable also and
realize that the more grievous way we have sinned against GOD, and GOD’s
unquestioning ability to grant us pardon, is in no way made up by our limited
forgiveness of the minor offenses committed against us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us reflectively pray the Lord’s Prayer and remember to
focus not only on the words, “forgives us our trespasses as we forgive those
who trespasses against us,” but also on the words “hallowed be thy name; thy
kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How much do I
reflect on the graciousness and forgiveness offered to me by a loving and
compassionate GOD?  Do I extend the same sort of graciousness and forgiveness
to those who have offended me? How might I be a better sign (“little
sacrament”) of GOD’s love and compassion to others, especially those who have
hurt me in any way?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all power and compassion. 
Through Your GOoDness we are brought into the new life through Baptism, and we
are forgiven our sins as we seek Your pardon.  Through Your Son, we are asked
to be life-giving signs to others, particularly to those who have offended us. 
Yet, because of our weakness, we hold grudges and withhold forgiveness from
those who have caused us hurt.  Continue to remind us of Your signs and
sacraments of new life and forgiveness.  We lift up this prayer of praise and
glory to You, in and through Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who has
died and rose to brings us into Your Promise Land of heaven, and Who is there
now living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:             Revelation 11: 19a, 12: 1-6a, 10ab;           Psalm
45: 10, 11, 12, 16;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                1 Corinthians. 15: 20-27;              Luke
1: 39-56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate the Assumption of Mary into heaven.  The
First Reading speaks about the woman who gives birth to a Son through Whom
salvation and power come into the world.  We also hear that GOD has prepared a
place for the woman.  The focus of the Responsorial is also a woman, a queen,
who is to take her rightful and glorious place beside the King.  St. Paul in
his First Letter to the Corinthians relates the order of things in heaven. 
There, Jesus comes into the presence of His Abba-Father, Who happens to be GOD,
and takes His position in splendor.  After Jesus comes all those who belong to
Him.  The Gospel today shares with us the account of Mary’s visit to her cousin
Elizabeth while both woman are pregnant – Elizabeth with John the Baptist and
Mary with Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s solemnity celebrates the tradition held since
apostolic times that Mary at her “dormition” (“sleeping”)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is placed in a tomb in Jerusalem.  When some of the faithful
go to the tomb after a few days of mourning, the tomb is empty because, before
her body decomposes, Mary (in her body) has been taken to heaven to be with her
Son, Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account from the Book of Revelation has linked Mary to
the woman giving birth to the One Who comes as Savior.  Both the woman and the
child face opposition from the dragon (symbol of Roman government and demonic
evil).  A special place is prepared by GOD for the woman.  Some people believe
that this in some way relates to Mary’s privilege of having her body taken to
heaven before it faced decay. [In Kay Murdy’s book,  Song of the Dove, she has
this vision while she is carrying Jesus.  If this is true, it might have been
Mary’s closeness to St. John that inspired him to relate this vision in the
Book of Revelation.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary is also associated with the queen mentioned in the
psalm today.  Just as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the queen takes her place beside the king in majesty and
splendor, so Mary is taken to heaven to share in the glory of her Son, Jesus. 
Just as the king in the psalm desires the presence of the queen at his side, so
Jesus wants His mother to be with Him, body and soul, in the glory of heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As St. Paul writes to the people of Corinth, he inspires
them with the words about the glories of heaven.  He mentions that Christ has
gone as the “first fruit” of GOD.  Jesus has taken His place in the glory of
heaven.  After Him, comes all those who belong to Christ.  Obviously, Mary, His
mother, is on the top of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>list of those who belong to Jesus.  It is fitting that she
should be the first, after her Son, to share the joys of heaven with her human
(but glorified) body, as all the faithful will at the end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although the Gospels never speak about the events of Mary’s
Assumption, today’s account of the visitation of Mary and her cousin Elizabeth
gives us a glimpse of Mary’s specialness.  Because she has said her “Fiat”
(“Let it be”), the child within her womb is the Son of GOD.  Elizabeth
recognizes the presence of holiness in Mary and the child in her womb, even
though Mary is only at the very beginning of her first trimester.  Even the
child within Elizabeth’s womb jumps for joy as he senses GOD’s touching the
lives of these holy women as they meet.  Mary responds to Elizabeth’s greeting
by praising GOD and GOD’s action in her life in the beautiful canticle of the
Magnificat </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord, my spirit
rejoices in GOD, my Savior. . .” This doctrine of the Assumption of Mary was
dogmatically</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>defined by Pope Pius XII on November 1, 1950, in the
apostolic constitution Munificentissimus Deus by exercising papal
infallibility.  The Assumption of Mary had been celebrated since apostolic
times.  Although I had been raised with teaching of the Assumption of Mary into
heaven, I had not experienced the full impact of the feast until I was studying
in Israel in August 1978.  In Jerusalem there is a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>church known as “Dormition Abbey.”  It is believed,
especially</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by the people in Jerusalem, to be one of the places where
Mary lived the last days of her life.  In the first half of August, an icon
(painting) of Mary is taken from the that ich is greeted</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by citizens of Jerusalem, be they Christian, Jewish, or
Muslim.  They celebrate that Mary’s body has not experienced decay but joyously
has been assumed into heaven to be with her Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary is held in high esteem by many Jerusalemites.  She is
considered a Jerusalem girl who has done well for herself because she gave
birth to Jesus, the great prophet.  [Many Jews and Muslims in Jerusalem respect
Jesus as a prophet, and Mary is mentioned in the Muslim Koran.]  Catholic
Christians (and members of some other denominations) believe that Mary’s
position as the mother of Jesus gives her the privilege of being the first to
share fully, i.e. body and soul, in the glory of the Reign of GOD with Jesus,
her Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This solemnity should be a positive reminder for all of us
who call ourselves disciples of the Lord Jesus.  We, too, will share in the
glory of heaven with Jesus our Savior, if we strive, as St. Paul says in
today’s Second Reading, to be those who belong to Christ.  We will one day
experience the fullness of heaven with our re- created bodies and joyously
celebrate with Him Who has put all of His enemies under His feet.  This is our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>destiny if we follow the Lord Jesus and say, “Fiat - Let it
be” to what GOD asks of us, just as Mary did.  We will then be able to be one
with the Lord Jesus and praise GOD’s name as Mary did in her canticle of the
Magnificat: “My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in
GOD my Savior. . .”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I reflect on
Mary’s position as the mother of Jesus and her saying “Fiat” (“Let it be”) to
GOD’s will, what thoughts do I have? How can I more fully respond to GOD’s call
to work for the furthering of the Gospel by saying my own “Fiat” to GOD’s will?
How do I react to the promise that, if I responded faithfully to GOD’s plan
(that Jesus has shown us through His ministry, life, death, and resurrection)
that I will share in the fullness of GOD’s Reign in heaven for ever?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving and desirous of
sharing the glory of Your Reign with those who respond to Your will, we come
before You as we reflect on the response of Mary to Your call.  You have
blessed her because of her willingness to say “Yes” to Your request.  She gave
birth to our Savior, Jesus, Your Divine Son.  You have graced her with many
blessings and allowed her to share in the glory of her Son, just as she shared
in His life, ministry, death, and resurrection. May we look forward to the joys
of heaven and being forever in Your presence and the presence of Your Son,
Jesus.  Through the overpowering of the Holy Spirit, helps us to respond
affirmatively to Your will.  We make this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayer in the name of Your Son Jesus, the Son of Mary.  It
is He Who has opened the gates of heaven for us and prepared a place for us in
Your home.  It is He Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Stephen of Hungary:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-stephen-of-hungary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Joshua 24: 14-29;       Psalm 16: 1-2a and 5,
7-8, 11;         Matthew 19: 13-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have two different views of GOD today.  In the First
Reading, Joshua asks the Chosen People if they will serve the LORD GOD and GOD
alone.  When they say they will, Joshua mentions that the LORD GOD is a jealous
GOD and demands quite a bit from those who would be faithful.  The psalm
reminds us that GOD is the inheritance for those who serve the LORD.  In the
Gospel, Jesus welcomes children to Himself and proclaims that it its to just
such children that the Reign of GOD belongs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joshua has led the Israelites into the Promise Land and has
helped establish them throughout the country that was bestowed upon Abraham and
his descendants.  At the end of his life of service of GOD and the people,
Joshua asks the people if they will continue to serve the LORD GOD Who has
saved them or if they will turn their hearts to one of the multitudes of gods
worshiped by the indigenous people, or by the Egyptians, or by the ancestors of
Abraham.  The people re-affirm what GOD has done for them and they say they
will serve the LORD.  Joshua admits that it is not easy serving GOD because GOD
demands total fidelity, but the rewards of serving the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD are the continued possession of the Promise Land. 
Joshua renews the covenant made by GOD with the Hebrew ancestors and then dies
at an old age after faithfully serving GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist proclaims that GOD is the inheritance of those
who serve the LORD. GOD protects and takes care of those who are committed to
the LORD.  With GOD at one’s side, there is nothing to fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus welcomes the children who come to Him,
even though the disciples were trying to keep the children away.  Jesus
mentions that the children, with their not overly sophisticated attitudes, are
the reason GOD has created the Reign of Heaven.  It is their simple</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faith, their unquestioning trust, and their ability to love
that makes them part of GOD’s inheritance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings present both a jealous GOD Whom people find
hard to serve and a loving, caring GOD Who reaches out to children and welcomes
them and blesses them.  Both images of GOD are accurate.  GOD has gone to a
great extent to provide a relationship that people could have with the Divine
and Supreme Being, but many people have taken for granted what GOD has
offered.  Others have intellectually tried to reason that they do not need GOD.
GOD is jealous and upset with those who want to fashion gods of their own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>liking, rather than accept GOD and the terms that GOD has
given.  In some ways, it is very difficult to follow the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD GOD in all things.  It means giving up some of our
self-determination and personal wishes and desires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, on the hand, GOD is both a loving Abba-Father and a
caring big Brother, Who reach out towards those who want to come to the Lord
Jesus.  The more sophisticated individuals often try to prevent those with
simple, yet profound, faith from coming to the Lord Jesus.  They put all sorts
of obstacles in the way so that others cannot easily come to be blessed by
Jesus.  Yet, Jesus reassures all of us that it is those who are simple and
desiring to come to the LORD GOD who will have a special relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings are challenging to me.  I realize that I
have often made having a relationship with GOD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more difficult that it is meant to be.  I want GOD to be my
GOD according to my standards.  I also have hindered the easy ingress to the
LORD for others by presuming to know what GOD wants and filtering out those whom
I see as not worthy of a relationship with the Lord Jesus.  In reality, none of
us are worthy of the LORD, but GOD chooses to have a relationship with us
anyway, and I am not able to block GOD’s desire to be in relationship with any
person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sense that I am being called to be more child-like in my
faith.  I should want to come into the Lord Jesus’ presence and just spend time
with Him.  I need to seek a blessing from Jesus and be happy to spend time with
Him.  It is when I can humbly, simply, and lovingly come to the Lord Jesus and
request His time and attention that I will receive blessings above and beyond
what I could ever imagine.  When I can do that, I will be able to echo the
words of the psalmist today and say, “Bless the LORD Who counsels me; even in
the night my heart exhorts me.  I set the LORD ever before me; with the LORD at
my right hand, I shall not be disturbed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Which of the two
images of GOD presented in the scriptures today do I most associate at this
point in my life: The jealous GOD Who will not tolerate any deviance from the
divine ways?  Or the GOD Who welcomes those who come with simple and trusting
faith?  How does my view of GOD affect my attitude toward GOD and toward
serving my sisters and brothers?  If the Lord Jesus is willing to welcome me as
a child of GOD, what should be my response to others who may not be on my level
but who are seeking to be with the Lord Jesus also and who are welcomed by GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all relationships.  Through
Your GOoDness, we are invited to come to You, our loving Abba-Father in and
through Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher.  Through the indwelling of the
Holy Spirit, give us the simple faith to come into Your presence as Your
beloved children.  Help us to long to sit at the feet of our Big Brother,
Jesus, and learn more from Him.  For the times we have failed to develop our
relationship with You and also prevented others from coming to You, we seek
Your pardon and forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we join all those who seek Your Reign and give You all
the glory and praise.  We make this prayer in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>name of the Lord Jesus, Your Son, and our Brother, the
Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-joan-of-the-cross</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Jeremiah 38: 4-6, 8-10;      Psalm 40: 2, 3, 4,
18;      Hebrews 12: 1-4;      Luke 12: 49-53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s reading, we are reminded that life is not always
filled with happiness.  Our journey is like a rose plant.  Yes, it is sometimes
beautiful to view, but there are sharp thorns attached that may cause us pain. 
Conflict and tension will exist, especially between those who seek the way of
the Lord Jesus and those who are finding their own way, apart from Jesus.  In
the First Reading we hear of one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the times that the prophet Jeremiah faced opposition for
his preaching GOD’s message.  The psalm echoes the faith of one who trusts in
the LORD even while experiencing hardships at the hands of others.  The Second
Reading reminds us that Jesus paid a costly price in order to bring us
salvation and we can expect similar demands and challenges in our journey on
this earth.  In the Gospel, Jesus remarks that His message will be a source of
conflict between individuals, even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the same family because His Gospel will be challenging to
those who do not follow the ways of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading takes place after Jeremiah continues to
announce hard times for the oppressed nation of Judah.  He has just prophesied</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that the king will be taken away to Babylon.  The leaders of
the people are tired of hearing Jeremiah’s message of gloom and doom, so they
seek the king’s permission to cast Jeremiah into an empty cistern (well).  One
court official comes to Jeremiah’s rescue and helps to pull him out of the pit
of destruction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm echoes the plight of Jeremiah being sunk into the
muddy mire of cistern, as the words of the psalmist proclaim that GOD hears the
cry from the one in the pit of destruction and rescues the suffering servant. 
The response of the rescued psalmist is to sing GOD’s praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Second Readings challenges us to turn away from sin
since we have been rescued by the Lord Jesus and at a great price – the price
of His own life.  Jesus was willing to suffer and to die for us, so we must be
willing to suffer also for the sake of spread of the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus proclaims that His message is a source
of conflict for people, even people of the same family. Those who are followers
of the Lord Jesus will meet opposition from those who seek their own ways. 
This will have the effect of splitting the family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life as a disciple of the Lord Jesus is not always a
comfortable experience.  We can expect hard times, particularly as we are
faithful to the Master-Teacher.  People, even members of our own family, will
oppose us as we share the challenging aspects of the GOoD News.  Prophets of
reform face resistance from those who do not want to reform their lives.  Those
who are complacent in their selfish lifestyles will want to silence the voice
of those who challenge their self-centered ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I hear these words, I sometimes wonder if I am doing
enough to proclaim the Gospel.  It may be that I try to surround myself with
people who believe the GOoD News in a similar way to my beliefs.  I ask myself,
“am I willing to take a stand against those who live lives contrary to the
Gospel?”  I am a person who sometimes is silent rather than speaking words that
would rock the boat, especially in stormy times. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am blessed within my family and friendships and church
community with people who have similar views of the Gospel message.  Yet, if we
take the message from the readings today, I can expect times of opposition,
even more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>so than I have experienced in the past.  I must be up to the
challenges that I might face.  That does not mean that I must provoke and
confront others just so that there is a sense of division between myself and
another member of my family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or in my group of friends or just acquaintances.  It means
that I must stand firm in my giving witness to the GOoD News.  I must always
act in a manner that shows my love for the person I am confronting or who is
confronting me, but even more love for my relationship with the Lord Jesus.  I
must boldly show my allegiance to the Master-Teacher.  The opposition and
division will come from the other person(s) not wanting to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>challenged by message of the Gospel.  I must speak the
Truth, but I must do it in a loving caring way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may face trying times, yet if we have the faith of the
psalmist and of the Lord Jesus Himself, we will be able to turn to GOD and
acknowledge from where our strength comes.  We will experience the help from
our GOD and be able to sing GOD’s praise, knowing that the Lord Jesus thinks of
us and is our help and our deliver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:     When have I
experienced division and opposition as I have proclaimed in actions or words
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus?  How have I handled the conflict? Have I sensed
the presence of Jesus with me as I have given witness to the GOoD News?   Have
I shied away from situations that might lead to confrontation simply because I
did not want to be under the pressure of taking a stand for the Lord Jesus?
What can I do to be better prepared to face the challenges of those who oppose
hearing the Word of the Master-Teacher? How can I show GOD’s love for others
while maintaining my allegiance to the Lord Jesus and His message of Truth?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of strength and deliverer
in times of conflict.  You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to proclaim the GOoD News
of Your love.  His message was met by those who opposed the Truth of His Word. 
Those who did not want to change their lives to be in step with His Gospel,
sought to silence Him as He spoke Your Word.  He accepted their opposition and
forecasted that those who followed Him would meet similar conflicts.  Continue
to empower us with the gifts of Your Holy Spirit so that we can proclaim the
Truth in love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by our actions and by our words, and we can give witness to
You and Your Son.  Reassure us with Your presence and help us to sing Your
praise even from the pits of destruction in which we are cast.  To You be all
glory, honor, and praise, in union with Your Son, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Louis of Toulouse:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-louis-of-toulouse</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Judges  2: 11-19;            Psalm 106: 34-35,
36-37, 39-40, 43ab and 44;       Matthew 19: 16-22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Complete obedience leads to a closer relationship with GOD. 
The First Reading describes the Israelites after the time of Joshua and how
they turned from the LORD until the LORD raised up judges to get them back on
track. The Responsorial Psalm reiterates the sinfulness of the Chosen People in
following the ways of the indigenous tribes in Canaan.  In the Gospel, Jesus is
questioned about what must be done to gain eternal life.  Besides</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>keeping the commandments, Jesus presents an invitation to
follow Him more closely (especially in reaching out to poor) in order to have
eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the death of Joshua, the Israelites started to
intermingle with the native Canaanites who worshiped an assortment of gods. 
The male god was addressed as “Baal” meaning “master” or “lord.”  The female
deity was known as “Ashtarte” and the plural of that would be “Ashtaroth.”
Thus, the descendants of the Exodus started to deviate from the way of the
LORD, the GOD Who had saved them.  GOD sent “judges” to aid the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Israelites both in military and spiritual matters.  The
judges first role seems to have been to help overthrow the oppressors of the
Children of Israel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and to show that GOD was willing to take care of them,
especially if they returned to the LORD and followed the commands of the LORD
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm explains that part of the problems that the
Israelites encountered was because they allowed the non-monotheistic tribes to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>influence the religious practices of the Israelites.  If
they had removed all the pagan effects as GOD had directed them, they would not
be tempted to follow paths leading away from GOD.  Many times, they cried out
to GOD for help, and GOD sent them the judges, but as soon as the judges died,
they went back to the wayward paths and became subjected to the power of the
other tribes and nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, a young, apparently wealthy or at least a
well-to-do, man seeks out Jesus and asks him a question so that he can be
justified in his mind and the minds of others around.  He wants to know if he
is on the right path to eternal life.  Jesus tells him to keep the
commandments.  Since the Jewish law included hundreds of laws and regulations,
the youthful man inquires which commandments.  When Jesus lists the latter part
of the ten commandments, the individual feels righteous because he has
faithfully kept those commandments. When he asks Jesus if there is anything
more, he expects Jesus to say, “No, that’s enough.”  Jesus, however, responds
that if he wants to be perfect, he should sell</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all that he possesses, give the money to the poor, and
follow Jesus.  Since the man has many possessions, he finds this too much to
accept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize how easy it is for
me to accept the ways of the worldly people and of the enemies of GOD which are
around me.  I start “worshiping” the false gods that people lift up to me,
whether they be riches, fame, power, or self-indulgent pleasures.  I often put
on a “righteous” attitude that I keep the commandments, while clinging to
possessions and other personal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>values that are not Gospel values.  Jesus challenges me to
let go of those false items and worldly ways and be willing to give everything
I have to others and then follow Jesus wherever He leads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I may not be asked to sell all that I possess, after all I
am responsible for the other members of my family and certain friends and the
support of my faith community, but I must not let my belongings weigh so
heavily upon me that I value them ahead of my relationship with the Lord Jesus
and my relationship to others.  I am called to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>follow the Lord Jesus and rely on Him above all else.  Yes,
I must be financially responsible for those whom GOD has entrusted to my care,
but I also must set example of clinging most strongly to what is important in
life – a relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, in the unity of
the Holy Spirit..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our journey to the home of Jesus’ Abba, we
need to stop every once in a while, and to reflect on the values in our lives. 
It is easy to be influenced by the people around us who worship their own gods
– gods named wealth, fame, possessions, and power.  We are being challenged to
make a commitment to the GOD Who has saved us and follow that GOD alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Is following Jesus
my number one priority, or do I learn and follow the works and values of the
world? How much am I willing to give up so that I can follow Jesus more
perfectly? How can I be an example and sign to others of the importance of
making the Lord Jesus and His Abba Priority One?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all creation.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have all that we need.  Yet, sometimes we forget that material
goods are just for our use and not for total abuse.  We allow things to take
possession of us and use us for the glory of the false gods.  For the times we
have not been willing to let go of our earthly possessions or worldly
attachments so that we could follow Your Son more completely, extend to us Your
pardon and peace.  Continue to pour out Your Holy Spirit so that we will have
the wisdom, strength, and patience to forsake whatever hinders us from
following the Way.  We make this prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus, Your
Son, and our Brother, the Way to You, and our Master-Teacher Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.   Amen.</p>

Saint John Eudes:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-eudes Readings: 
Judges 6: 11-24a;       Psalm 85: 9, 11-12, 13-14;          Matthew 19: 23-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is the GOD of (apparent) paradoxes.  In the First
Reading we see how GOD uses the weak and insignificant to bring safety and
liberation to the People of GOD.  The Responsorial Psalm reminds us that GOD is
the giver of peace and justice even in the midst of trial and oppression.  In the
Gospel, Jesus speaks about the paradoxes of giving up everything to inherit
that which is beyond all value and that the apparently first will be last,
while the apparently last will be first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gideon is an insignificant member of a family that is a part
of one of the less than important tribes in Israel.  He and the rest of the
Chosen People are once again oppressed by another nation – this</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time it is the Midianites.  GOD calls Gideon to be the
champion of all of the tribes of Israel.  After testing to see if it is really
the LORD Who is calling him to this task, Gideon realizes how blessed he has
been to see GOD (or the Angel of GOD) and not die.  GOD speaks a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>message of Shalom (peace) to Gideon and he, in turn, sets up
a memorial to the GOD of peace (YHWH-Shalom).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm picks up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the theme of GOD being the source of peace and justice. 
GOD speaks, and peace and kindness happen.  Even in the midst of the most
trying times, GOD brings a sense of truth, justice, and peace to those who are
faithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus gives a further explanation of how
difficult it is for those who are controlled by their possessions to enter into
the Reign of GOD.  The more people are surrounded by riches and let their
wealth dictate their actions, the less chance they have of being a part of the
Reign of GOD.  It is only with GOD’s help that anyone can overcome the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lure of possessions and be a part of GOD’s plan.  This makes
Jesus’ disciples question their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>part in the Reign of GOD.  Jesus reassures them that if they
have prioritized their lives and put their relationships with GOD on the top
and given up possessions in order to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>proclaimers of the Reign of GOD, then they will enter into
that Reign ahead of others who think that they have done the right things by
strict adherence to the rules and regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am once again reminded of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the need to evaluate what my priorities in life should be. 
They are not to amass a fortune or a lot of possessions, so that my first and
only thought is how I can keep what I have and gain even more.  Instead, my
mission is to announce the GOoD News to others and reassure them of the
presence of the GOD of peace.  Through me, GOD is able to speak words of
shalom-peace to those who are heavily burdened in life with financial,
relational, physical, emotional, or spiritual problems.  GOD speaks the same
word to us who call upon GOD that the LORD spoke to Gideon:  “Be at peace, fear
not, you shall live.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It helps me to reflect on the meaning of the word, shalom. 
Shalom means much more than “peace.”  It means “fullness, completeness, health,
tranquility” and more.  It is similar in meaning to the Latin word, salus.  It
implies that everything is in proper relationship first with GOD, then with
others, even though externally there is conflict and discord.  It implies a
belief that GOD is making all things right and want us to be a part of making </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The problem most of us face is we focus our time and
attention on that which is not of the Lord Jesus.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>know I have let concern over financial matters take
precedence in my life at times.  I have worried how due dates would be met. 
Yet, I know that if I am faithful to the Lord Jesus, then Jesus will take care
of me.  This thought was driven home to me when I read a book entitled  Peace
Like a River by Leif Enger.  In that book, the single head of house, Jeremiah
Land, seems to find peace in the midst of one of his sons’ being on trial for
murder, his being fired from his job, and his being hounded while he searches
for his escaped son.  Throughout it all, not only does he find peace, but he
brings a sense of peace and justice to his family, his enemies, and
passers-by.  It seems that his relationship to GOD as seen in scripture is the
source of his peace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Life can be very challenging and the ways of the world very
alluring.  Tension and pressure are all around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, if we keep our eyes focused on the Lord Jesus, then we
will be given the peace that is beyond understanding. Then we will be able to
join today’s psalmist and proclaim to others, “The LORD GOD will give divine
benefits.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced a profound sense of the GOD of Peace while living in a stressful
situation? To what riches/possessions do I cling and which I must be willing to
give up in order to inherit the Reign of GOD?  How can I be a proclaimer of the
GOD of Peace to others who are experiencing challenging times right now?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all blessings and GOD of Shalom-Peace. 
Through Your GOoDness You have bestowed peace upon us in the midst of the daily
trials and tribulations that we face.  You promise us a share in the Reign that
Your Son established through His ministry, life, death, and resurrection.  We
have sometimes turned our focus to worries about finances, position, and
prestige instead of realizing the blessing that You give to those who trust in
You.  Continue to strengthen us through the working of Your Holy Spirit in our
lives.  Help us to particularly focus on Your gifts of kindness and peace when
we feel most burdened by the pressures of life.  And may we be the source of
Your GOoD News of Shalom-Peace to those we meet.  We make this prayer in the
name of the Lord Jesus, Your Son, and our Brother, the Way to You, and our
Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Judges 9: 6-15;           Psalm 21: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7;         
Matthew 20: 1-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people most often emotionally hurt when dealing with
their relationship to GOD are those who expect something different than what
GOD desires for them.  The First Reading describes how some of the Israelites
seek to have a king like their neighbors, but this is not what GOD wants, as is
obvious from the parable told by Jotham.  The psalm speaks about a king whose
is of the LORD’s choosing.  In the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable about the
justice and generosity of vineyard owner who hires day laborers at different
times of the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, The Israelites look around at the
neighboring tribes and nations and see that the surrounding peoples have kings
ruling over them.  They want to keep up with the Joneses (or Canaanites) and
have a king also.  Although this is not what GOD wants for them, the people of
Shechem and Beth-millo choose Abimelech to be their king.  A judge named Jotham
climbs up a mountain (Mount Gerizim) where he can look down at the town of
Shechem.  From there,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jotham tells the parable of the trees looking for another
tree to be the king of the trees.  Those trees that are doing what they should
(the olive tree, the fig tree, and the vine) continue to produce what they are
called to do.  They are grateful that they can bring joy and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>happiness to others by doing what GOD intends them to do –
producing fruit.  They do not seek to wave over</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the other trees.  The buckthorn, a prickly bush, agrees to
rule over the trees and inflicts harsh times upon the other trees.  Jotham is
forecasting hard times for the people for their choosing to have a king which
is not according to the plan of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist, living in a later period of time than the
judges, describes the king whom GOD has blessed and established to rule over
the Chosen People.  If GOD chooses a king, GOD bestows on the king the
wherewithal to do the work that GOD intends for the leader of the People of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Building on the last lines of yesterday’s Gospel (“The last
shall be first and the first shall be last”), today’s Gospel is Jesus’ parable
about the vineyard owner who seeks day laborers to work in the vineyard.  The
owner goes out at the first hour of the day (6 a.m.) and hires workers and
promises to give them a just wage (a day’s pay).  Returning to the city
marketplace where laborers are hired for work, the owner sends out more workers
at the third hour (9 a.m.), the sixth hour (noon), the ninth hour (3 p.m.) and
finally at the eleventh hour (5 p.m.).  At 6:00 in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>evening, the owner tells the foreman to pay the workers
beginning with those who worked only one hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They receive a full day’s pay.  Those who have worked all
day under the scorching</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sun and for twelve hours expect to be paid more. Yet,
everyone is paid a day’s wage.  The first hired </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>day-laborers complain to the owner about his unfair
dealings.  The owner said he did not cheat anyone because he gave everyone a
day’s pay.  He was just generous to those who worked less.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that I often expect
GOD to act in the way that I want GOD to act.  I am not that much different
than the people of the First Reading who decide they want a king and expect GOD
to bless the king, even though GOD does not want the people to be ruled by a
king at this point in their history.  I also complain when I don’t think GOD is
fair in the way GOD treats people, especially me, when I feel like I am on the
losing end of a proposition.  GOD does not seem to be unjust, but at times GOD
seems to be more just to some than to others.  I see people who seem to be
latecomers in their walk of faith.  They receive blessings that I would like to
have.  Not that GOD has not been generous to me, but I envy what others have. 
“Why do some people get more ‘breaks’ than I get?” I ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD can never be accused of being unjust.  Yet, the kindness
and generosity of GOD sometimes astounds me.  I am reminded of the line in
Animal Farm that states, “All animals are equal, but some are more equal than
others.”  It seems that way with GOD.  GOD seems to treat some people more
equally than me.  But who am I to complain about GOD’s generosity? I have
received from GOD much more than I deserve.  GOD has blessed me with life, with
faith, with forgiveness, and with love.  I don’t deserve any of those.  I can’t
earn those gifts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because of what I do.  Instead, I should rejoice that GOD
has gifted others.  I do not know, nor might I ever</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>know, why GOD acts the way GOD acts.  Yet, I am not in the
position from which I can judge GOD.  I am challenged to reflect on the gifts
and blessing GOD has given me and praise and thank GOD for those gifts and also
rejoice at the way GOD blesses others and gifts them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How do I respond
when others seem to get special blessings from the LORD GOD and I do not
receive what I think I should have? Am I always grateful for the abundant gifts
I have already received from GOD?  How can I reflect to others the joy of GOD’s
blessing people other than themselves?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all justice.  Through Your
GOoDness we have received many blessings, more than we can ever earn or
deserve.  Yet, true to our weak human nature, we complain when we are envious
of the blessings You bestow on others.  We forget how kind and loving You have
been to us.  For the times we have acted out of jealousy rather than gratitude,
we seek Your forgiveness.  May we take to heart the teachings of Your Son,
Jesus and be strengthened by the gifts of Your Holy Spirit so that we can
praise and thank You for touching our lives with Your justice and mercy, that
far exceed what we deserve.  Also, help us to be joyful when others are
beneficiaries of Your love.  We make this prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus,
Your Son, and our Brother, and our Master-Teacher, Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Judges 11: 29-39a;       Psalm 40: 5, 7-8a, 8b-9,
10;          Matthew 22: 1-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The importance of keeping one’s promises (particularly
promises made to the LORD GOD) are the focus of today’s readings.  In the First
Reading, Jephthah makes a promise to the LORD if the LORD GOD would give him
victory over his enemies.  The psalm speaks about the importance of trusting in
GOD and being obedient to GOD’s will.  In the Gospel, Jesus tells a parable of
a wedding feast to which those who were first invited refuse to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from the Book of Judges may cause some people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a problem because of the results of the promise made by
Jephthah. He had bargained with GOD to offer in sacrifice the first person whom
he met after returning from a military battle, if GOD would give him and his
fellow tribes’ soldiers victory over their enemies. As Jephthah returns to his
home, he is greeted by his jubilant daughter.  Even though Jephthah regrets
having to sacrifice his only child, he keeps the promise he made to the LORD. 
To me, the story is not told to lift up the practices of bargaining with GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>nor of offering people as sacrifices to GOD.  The purpose of
the inclusion of this account is to show how important it is to keep one’s
promises, especially to the LORD GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm praises the one who does the will of GOD. 
Trusting fully in the LORD and being obedient to the LORD is more important
than any sacrifices. One’s faith is demonstrated in one’s following the ways of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus shares a parable concerning the Reign
of Heaven.  He compares it to a king who is preparing a huge banquet feast for
his son.  Those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who were first invited (the Chosen People of old) refuse to
come to the feast, and they even mistreat and kill the royal messengers
(prophets).  The ruler punishes those who refuse to come to the feast.  Since
the feast is prepared, the king desires to fill the banquet feast and so he has
his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>servants gather all whom they can find (the Gentiles).  The
only condition is that those who come must put on the wedding garment (be
reconciled, be baptized, and be clothed with Christ).  One guest is found
without a wedding garment (not having accepted the requirements of the royal
leader).  This one is to be turned out from the feast, just as those who were
first invited were turned away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember talking with a long-time friend who reminded me
that it was GOD’s will that all people be part of the Reign of GOD (receive the
gift of salvation).  GOD desires our being saved more than we do.  GOD does ask
that we respond to gift of salvation and that we live our lives in a manner
that shows that we are striving to be faithful to the promises we made when we
accepted the gift that GOD has given us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of us need to be more “responsible.”  We need to “be
able to respond” to GOD in a more authentic and full way.  All salvation and
heavenly gifts come from GOD.  We do not earn GOD’s benevolence.  Our only
response is literally that – being responsible – seeking to trust the Lord
Jesus and do the Abba-Father’s will as best as we possibly can.  Even our
ability to respond is a gift from GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is important on our part is our attitude and
intention.  We need to make sure that we act appropriately upon the invitation
we receive from GOD and not refuse the invitation as did those who were first
invited into today’s Gospel.  Our goal should not just be to make it to heaven,
but to start celebrating right now at the feast that is laid before us.  We
should want to share the blessing we have with others so that they, too, can
begin to feast at the banquet of the Lord Jesus.  If we are able to do that,
then we will be able to join the psalmist today and say, “I announced Your
justice in the vast assembly; I did not restrain my lips, as You, O LORD,
know.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I respond to
GOD’s graciousness and to the promises I have made to the Lord Jesus?  What sort
of promises should I make to GOD? What can I do to help others be more
responsible to GOD’s plan for their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all graciousness.  Through
Your GOoDness we have been invited to Your royal banquet feast.  At times we have
acted in ways that have been either a partial or a complete refusal of Your
invitation.  For this we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Even Your
forgiveness is another one of Your gifts to us, for we do not deserve that You
extend Your shalom-peace to us.  We thank You for allowing us to be a part of
Your celebration at this moment in our lives and for all eternity.  May our
putting on and wearing of the garment of the celebration of Your Son, Jesus,
symbolize our desire to do all that You have asked of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we be a source of Your inviting others to Your feast. 
We make this prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Son, the Bridegroom, and our Brother, and our
Master-Teacher Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ruth 1: 1, 3-6, 14b-16, 22;       Psalm 146:
5-6ab, 6c-7, 8-9a, 9bc-10;       Matthew 22: 34-40</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love is the key to the life of a believer.  Love is
essential for relationships.  In the First Reading we hear how Ruth, a non-Jew,
desires to go with her widowed mother-in-law back to the land of Israel, to the
tribe of Judah. She does this because she is moved by love to accompany her
mother-in-law, even though she herself is a widow, needing to be loved.  The
Responsorial Psalm praises those who trust in the GOoDness (and the love) of
the LORD.  In the Gospel, when Jesus is asked what is the most important
commandment, He responds by saying loving GOD is the first and most important
commandment and loving one’s neighbor as oneself is the second greatest
commandment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading sets the scene for explaining how one of
the ancestors of King David was a non-Jew named Ruth.  During a famine
Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their two sons crossed the Jordan River to the
area east of the Jordan known as Moab.  There the sons marry Moabite woman. 
While living in Moab, four key events happen:  Elimelech dies, his two sons
die, the famine ends in the land of Judah, and Naomi prepares to return to her
tribal land of Judah.  According to the law of the time, the two women who had
married the sons of Elimelech were free to return to their own people after the
death of their husbands, since Naomi had no other sons.  Ruth decides to go
with the widow, and now son-less, Naomi, and be part of her family in the area
reserved for the descendants of Judah.  It was the love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>she had for Naomi that prompted her to go to Judah.  And
from Ruth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would be born the ancestors of King David.  Tomorrow, we
will have a reading about Ruth finding her new husband, Boaz, a relative of
Naomi.  Boaz and Ruth marry and have a son, Jesse, who is thought of as Naomi’s
grandchild, even though there is no direct blood ties.  This story of the
selfless acts of Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz is told because it explains the ancestry
of King David, and also of the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist calls blessed those who trust in GOD, for the
LORD will take care of them.  Part of the psalm describes the special love and
concern that GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>shows to widows and childless women.  This is part of the
link to the First Reading.  GOD can truly make awesome things happen from
apparently hopeless situations.  Naomi was able to be one of the ancestors of
the future King David even though her sons were both dead.  Ruth, a non-Jew by
birth, also becomes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>part of the line that will produce a royal offspring.  GOD
loves those who love the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD and who love others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, one of the religious leaders tries to trap
Jesus by having Him describe what is the most important commandment from GOD. 
The scholar, together with his fellow religious and legal leaders, were hoping
that Jesus would say something that was against the Torah or something that had
been refuted by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other rabbis.  Jesus summarizes and prioritizes all of the laws
with the insistence on the law of loving GOD with everything one has and the
law of loving others as one loves oneself.  Jesus’ stress on love truly
capsulizes the essence of all rules and regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love is an essential characteristic of a disciple of Jesus. 
In John 13: 35, Jesus describes the mark of distinction of being one of His
disciples as the way His disciples love one another.  Love is much more than an
emotional outpouring of one’s feelings.  Love is more than a pleasurable
experience.  Love is essentially the decision to think of another before one
thinks of oneself.  Our first priority is to love GOD with everything we have
(our whole minds, our whole hearts, and our whole souls).  Yet before we can
love GOD, we have to be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>made aware that GOD has first loved us.  GOD, Who is Love,
is the origin and source of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD first loved us.  Yet most of us have not experienced the
love of GOD first in a direct way, we first experienced love by other humans
loving us.  And once we have experienced love, then we can begin to accept the
fact that we are loveable, not because of who we are or what we do, but simple
because another chooses to love us.  If we are loveable, then we ought to love
ourselves.  Yet true love of ourselves should not lead to selfish behavior, but
to wanting to love others because we have been loved and we want others to
experience what love is, because we also believe they are loveable.  And it is
in loving others that we demonstrate our love for GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus GOD is the beginning and the end of the process and
also the force behind the love throughout the whole process, for as 1 John 4: 8
and 12 state, GOD is love.  Those who seem to be having rough times, if they
are able to call upon the Lord Jesus, will experience the love that is GOD and
the GOD Who is Love.  It is when people need</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to experience love that they should turn to GOD, and GOD
will care and love them in a way that surpasses their expectation.  Today’s
psalm describes the way the LORD cares for those who need divine love, by
providing for the needy and sustaining those who have no other means of
sustenance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    How did I first
experience love?  Which person(s) was/were instrumental in my knowing what it
meant to be loved? How was I able to experience that I was loved by GOD not for
what I did but merely because the LORD GOD has chosen to love me? In what ways
have I demonstrated my ability to love others because they are also loved by
GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all love.  Through Your
GOoDness, we are loved by You.  As a sign of Your love, You have placed in our
lives other individuals who love us.  Yet, we have not always accepted the fact
that we are loveable because You have loved us.  We have acted in ways that denied
our lovableness.  We have sought to hurt ourselves because we failed to accept
Your love.  We thank You for sending us Your Son, Jesus, Who reminds us of Your
love and calls us to share that love with others.  Continue to empower us by
Your Holy Spirit so that we can be sources of Your love flowing to others,
especially those who are most in need of being reminded of how much You love
them.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Who is Love
personified.  He is our loving Brother Who has demonstrated Your love by His
freely choosing to teach, heal, suffer, die, and rise for us.  He is the One
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
loving GOD, now and forever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ruth 2: 1-3, 8-11; 4: 13-17;       Psalm 128:
1b-2, 3, 4, 5;         Matthew 23: 1-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD blesses those who turn to the LORD.  Today’s First
Reading is just one example of that.  Both Naomi and her daughter-in-law, Ruth,
trust GOD and GOD provides for them, and they become the ancestors of the
future king, and also of the Messiah.  The Responsorial builds on the theme of
GOD’s blessing of those who put their faith in the LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus
speaks against the actions of the religious leaders and tells His disciples
that they should be obedient to those in authority and, if and when they take
positions of authority, they should not be pretentious as are some people in
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ruth and Naomi are part of the Anawim.  They are widows and
childless, since Naomi’s two sons are dead, and Ruth has not yet had any
children.  Although they were to be cared for by the community, they were not
held in high esteem.  The law said they, and other outcasts and the poor, were
entitled to the leftovers of the harvest after the main harvest had been
collected by the owners of the fields. Boaz, a kinsman of Naomi’s dead husband,
has heard how Ruth came back to the land of Judah with her mother-in-law,
Naomi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boaz respects Ruth for her care and concern for Naomi.  Boaz
and Ruth marry and have a son, called Obed, who is thought of as Naomi’s
grandchild, even though there is no direct blood ties.  This story of the
selfless acts of Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz is told because it explains the ancestry
of King David, and also of the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm describes how GOD takes care of the
individual who fears (trusts) the LORD and is willing to follow GOD’s ways. 
Some of the blessings include a loving spouse, caring and obedient children,
and prosperity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is aware of the hypocrisy of some of
the religious leaders.  They have an air of superiority because of their
position and authority.  They enforce the strictest interpretation of the law
on the people, but they are not willing to assist those who struggle with their
imposition of the requirements.  They act in ways to manifest their importance
by wearing ostentatious signs of their religiosity.  Jesus tells</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His disciples that they need to respect the authority of
their leaders, but they are not to follow their example.  He also warns against
acting proud and seeking titles of distinction.  They are to realize that the
LORD GOD alone is the true authority, the ultimate teacher, the authentic
loving parent, the true master.  Everyone else is to be subservient to the LORD
GOD.  We are thus called to be humble, that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is not thinking less of ourselves (putting down who we are
in GOD’s sight), but to think of ourselves less often (and of others more
often).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings are challenging to me, as are most scripture
passages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel a call to look at my attitude towards others,
especially my attitude towards those whom I may consider as under me, that is,
under my authority.  I also sense a need to be more GOD-fearing and loving in
my approach to others.  This leads me to reflect once again upon the model of
leadership which Jesus exercises.  Even though He is the Son of GOD, He does
not demand special attention and privileges.  His way of leading is by serving
–</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doing whatever is necessary to help others, particularly the
less fortunate and outcasts.  Jesus is the Master Who </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>came not to be served, but to serve and to give His life for
the sake of others.  He is the Teacher Who instructs not just with words spoken
with true authority, but Who models what He teaches by His very lifestyle. 
Jesus reveals His Abba-Father as the true, loving Divine Parent Who has been
willing to allow the Son to die in order to save others.  [An aside:  the son
of Ruth is names Obed, which in Hebrew means “servant.” Although the Latin word
from which “obedience” comes is not directly connect to the Hebrew obed, a
person who is a servant is obedient to those in authority.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What should motivate us to do our best is the realization of
Jesus’ doing the Best to bring us salus (healing, safety, wholeness,
salvation).  Although we should not look to the rewards of our being faithful
to the calling we have received from the Lord Jesus, He will truly bless us. 
We will experience the fullness of life as we, obedient servants, serve Jesus by
serving others.  Yet the blessings we receive are not the purpose of our living
lives modeled on our Master-Teacher.  The blessings GOD bestows are just
another sign of how much GOD loves those who seek to do the divine will.  Yes,
as the psalmist remarks today, we shall eat the fruit of our handiwork, but we
should trust the LORD, because GOD has already given us more than we deserve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How have I
experienced the benevolence of GOD in my life?  What is my attitude towards
those in authority?  Am I able to respect authority while not always agreeing
with the negative and poor example set by some who are in power?  What is my
attitude when I am in a position of leadership?  Who might benefit most from my
acts of humble and obedient service of them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all blessings.  Through Your
GOoDness we have benefitted in ways that are beyond our worth.  Yet, like the
religious leaders of old, we sometimes think more of ourselves than we should.
We try to make our importance felt by imposing our thoughts and desires on
others.  Yet, Jesus, Your Son, has shown us what being in authority is meant to
be – loving service of others.  For the times we have failed to follow the
example of Jesus, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to bless us by
the outpouring of Your Holy Spirit so we may have the wisdom, strength, and
patience to minister to those whom You have entrusted to our care.  May we
continually re-evaluate our lives in the Light of Your Son.  It is in His name
that we make this prayer, for He is our Master-Teacher, our Savior and Brother,
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
now and forever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings are challenging and at the same time
reassuring.  The First Reading may gives us a sense of reassurance as we hear
that people from many nations will be welcomed into the presence of GOD.  The
Responsorial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm has a similar theme in that it is an invitation for
all nations to praise GOD.  The Second Reading is on the challenging side.  The
author uses an analogy of a parent disciplining a child as a means of allowing
the child to grow.  Jesus’ words in the Gospel are also challenging because He
speaks of the narrow gate through which not all will pass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, Isaiah is addressing his countrymen
around the time of exiles’ return.  He mentions that soon GOD will not only
invite the exiles back to GOD’s presence on the holy mountain (Jerusalem), but
the LORD will also welcome various other people from distant lands.  GOD’s
dwelling place will be open to all who seek a relationship with the LORD.  It
will be a time of rejoicing as people worship the LORD GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s Responsorial is the shortest psalm.  We have all of
it (two verses) today. It is succinct and to the point.  All people are invited
to praise GOD and GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loving kindness and faithfulness.  As GOD welcomes all
nations into the divine presence, it will be a time of great rejoicing.
Alleluia! Praise the LORD!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The author of the Letter to the Hebrews reminds his readers
(including us) that just as a loving parent disciplines a child using
uncomfortable and even painful means (not necessarily physical, but emotional
and mental) in order that the child develops into a mature individual, so also
GOD allows us, GOD’s own adopted children, to experience difficult times in
order to discipline us and helps us mature.  It is interesting that the word
“discipline” and “disciple” both have the same root.  It refers to the process
of on-going education and learning from experience.  Those who wish to be
disciples of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus will need to be disciplined.  Discipline is not
always easy or “fun,” but it is necessary part of being formed into a disciple
of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, is asked about who will be saved.  His
response may be a bit disconcerting at first glance.  He uses the image of a
narrow gate through which it is difficult to pass.  He alludes to the fact that
some will not march through the gate into GOD’s dwelling with the pomp and
majesty to which they are accustomed.  He also says that a time will come when
the Lord and Master will close the gate and no one else will be admitted, even
those who think they have a right to be there.  He then concludes by saying
that some of those whom other people have not envisioned as worthy of entering
will be admitted, while those who believed that they had a sure passage will be
excluded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some scripture scholars believe that Jesus’ words in today’s
Gospel are directed at the religious leaders of His time who presumed that they
were the righteous ones who would be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blessed by being in GOD’s presence.  That may be true, but
they are also words for us.  The readings speak to me about the two key
positions that are opposed to GOD’s plan.  One position is that of presumption
and the other is that of despair.  These are the two extremes we must avoid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Presumption is the sin of thinking that one has GOD’s plan
figured out.  In a sense, the presumptuous person no longer needs GOD or a
relationship with GOD because one can take care of the whole issue of salvation
by oneself. Presumptuous persons are self-righteous. They believe that they
have it made, and they look down on everyone else. They have a
“better-than-thou” or “holier-than-thou” attitude.  Their view is even more
narrow than the Gospel’s description today.  From their perspective, only they,
and a </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>few others like themselves, are going to experience
happiness, which they think is the goal in this life.  They make others jump
through all sorts of hoops and then tell them, “Not good enough; too bad you
are not like us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other extreme, that can be often brought about by the presumptuous
attitudes of the self-righteousness of others, is that of despair.  People in
despair sees no hope of ever experiencing a relationship with GOD.  They give
up.  They figure that there is no chance for them, so why try.  They lack the
desire and energy to try or keep trying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The scripture passages for today helps us to have the
correct perspective on GOD’s plans.  Being welcomed into GOD’s Reign will take
work and discipline on our part.  It is an on-going process of learning who we
are in relationship to GOD. GOD wants all of us to make it, but it will take
personal effort, patience, and faith/hope in GOD.  Although in the last
sentence, I listed faith/hope in GOD last, it must be both the starting and
ending point of our life.  GOD gifts us with faith and hope.  The Lord Jesus
reassures us that we can make it with GOD’s help and that it is GOD’s will that
we have a personal and communal relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Effort is what we put into our journeying. We must do our
part (with GOD’s help).  We cannot sit back (like the self- righteous) and
presume that we don’t have to do anything because we have already made it or we
don’t need GOD’s help. This is where discipline begins.  We must allow
ourselves to be disciplined.  We, the disciples-apprentices to the Great
Master-Teacher, must do as our Master-Teacher directs.  We must imitate Him in
His earthly life – sharing the GOoD News, touching people’s lives with
compassion and love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Discipline involves enduring patience.  Remember that
“patience” comes from the Latin word for “suffering.” We must be patient with
ourselves, with others, and even with GOD’s final plan.  We may have to suffer
as we follow our Master- Teacher.  Another word that comes from the same Latin
source as “patience” is the word “compassion” which literally means “suffering
with.”  We must suffer with others.  We must try to help them along the narrow
way and show that we are on the journey together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, the gate is narrow.  It is not meant to prevent entry
into GOD’s Reign, but to slow down the haughty who want to parade into the
presence of GOD with the focus being on themselves.  The gate is narrow to slow
down and allow us to concentrate and help others.  I am reminded of some of the
paths I have taken as I have backpacked. Sometimes we would come to a narrow
part in the trail.  There may have been some hindrances to a quick passage
through the trail.  At times we had to help our fellow packers to get by,
through, or over that which restricted our route.  Once we had passed through
the narrow passageway, we were able to experience together the joys of our
journey and our final destination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is inviting us into the divine presence.  GOD has given
us the faith/hope to make it.  We must apply ourselves with discipline and
patience.  Those who are presumptuous and unwilling to change will not make
it.  We must focus on being as compassionate as our Master-Teacher and assist
those who journey with us.  We may have to take the time to comfort the
disturbed and also disturb the comfortable.  But with GOD’s help, we will be
able to rejoice with all those who are finally welcomed into GOD’s presence
forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my view of
making it into GOD’s presence? Am I presuming that I have it made?  Do I
experience despair and almost give up?  How much work and effort am I willing
to expend, not only for myself, but also for my fellow travelers on the
journey? Do I look to Jesus as the Master-Teacher, as the One Whom I must
imitate? How do I respond to the discipline that I must go through in order to
follow the Master-Teacher? Which disciplines do I need to practice more, and
then learn from them? How can I be more of GOoD fellow traveler with those who
are on the journey to GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD, ever loving and caring.  Through
Your GOoDness, You call us into Your Reign.  You challenge us to follow the
compassionate and disciplining Master-Teacher, Your Son, Jesus.  He has shown
us the Way to You, for He is the Way.  For the times we have presumed we could
do it without Your help or given up during the challenging trials, we ask Your
forgiveness.  Continue to pour into us the gifts of Your Holy Spirit,
especially the gifts of faith, hope, compassion, patience, and love.  We join
the peoples of all nations whom You have called, in lifting up a prayer of
praise and thanks to You.  We proclaim Your glory in union with Your Son,
Jesus, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Who has opened the gate for us through
His life of ministry, His death and resurrection, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 1: 1-5, 8b-10;        Psalm 149:
1b-2, 3-4, 5-6a and 9;          Matthew 23: 13-22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings give a sharp contrast between the faithful
believer and the persons of false religiosity.  In the introduction of his
letter to the faithful at Thessalonika, St. Paul praise their faith, love, and
hope.  The psalm reminds us that GOD is delighted by those who seek to do GOD’s
will and that GOD is the source of joy for them.  In the Gospel, Jesus
chastises the religious leaders of His day who manifest their real spirit by
their hypocritical behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Around 51 A.D., St. Paul writes his letter to the faith
community of the Thessalonians that he helped found a year or so before.  He
praises GOD for their response to his preaching and their acceptance of GOD’s
gifts.  He mentions, for the first time together, the three gifts of faith,
hope, and love (known as the “theological virtues”).  Paul is pleased at how
well the believers in this community have embraced not only the teachings, but
the practice of their newly found faith.  He remarks how they have truly turned
from their false worship of idols to the worship of the one, true GOD.  They
are anxiously</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>awaiting the return of the Lord Jesus, that he had told them
was imminent, when Paul first preached to them.  In his letters to the
Thessalonians, he seems to realize that the Lord Jesus may not come back quite
as soon as he first believed.  He still edifies the faithful and encourages
them to continue in their faith, their love, and their hope based upon Jesus’
eventual return, and to rejoice that the Lord Jesus is with them right now,
even if Jesus has not yet fully returned as He will at the end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist encourages the faithful to rejoice in their
relationship with GOD, in a manner similar to Paul’s words to the
Thessalonians.  Expressing one’s joy in the LORD should mark the life of a true
believer in GOD.  For the LORD takes pleasure and delights in the faith of
those who seek to do GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, in sharp contrast to the joy and praise of,
and for, the truly faithful, Jesus criticizes the religiosity of some of the
religious leaders.  Their attitude of superiority prevents true believers from
experiencing the Reign of GOD.  Because of the fears and insecurities in their
own lives, they put so many obstacles and stumbling blocks (skandaloi) in the
way of converts to the faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They lead the new believer to disbelief.  The new</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>converts become children of “Gehenna” – the place of the
condemned.  [Gehenna is a translation of “Ge Hinnon,” the Valley of Hinnom. 
The Valley of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hinnom is to the west of Jerusalem. It was where the rubbish
and trash of Jerusalem was thrown and burned.  It was always aflame and gave
off a terrible odor, thus it was used as a symbol of hell.]  Jesus also
declares a message of woe to the false leaders of the faith who wrongly give
more value to the gold and the gifts that are used in the Temple and in worship
than to the Temple and the altar that are the truly holy objects because they
represent the presence of GOD.  Jesus’ condemnation of the practices of the
hypocritic leaders is a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>warning also to those who would be His disciples not to
misplace their priorities in being members of the Reign</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of GOD, speaking especially to those who have positions of
leadership in the faith community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I read the scripture passages today, I sense that the
characteristics of a true believer can be easily discerned as different from
those of someone who is misguided in their faith.  The faithful disciple will
have a life marked with joy and peace, in contrast to the sense of anger and
frustration of a deluded religious person.  This does not </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mean that the life of a true believer is not challenging and
difficult, in fact, a believer’s life is often marked by rough times.  What is
different is that one who is aware of GOD’s presence in her/his life is able to
face the rough times with a sense of faith, hope, and love that is not as
evident in the life of the misdirected person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have met individuals who seem to have everything going
their way.  Yet they exhibit an attitude of unhappiness and anger that implies
that they do not have the true awareness of the Lord Jesus’ presence in their
life.  They also seek to make other people as miserable as themselves by
exuding a negativity on others.  They drain my energy and my positive feelings
as I deal with them.  They seem hopeless and unable to love or to accept love
from others.  The idea of GOD and GOD’s presence is so far from them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast, I have meet other people who are going through
some of the most difficult situations I could imagine, yet they have such a
positive attitude that I am aware of GOD’s presence with them.  I am edified
and built up by the way they handle their trying times.  Their faith in GOD is
what gives them hope.  They are able to love and be loved because the GOD of
love is evident to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another thing that strikes me is how much delight GOD takes
in the beloved of GOD.  Part of this came from the reading of Henri Nouwen’s
book,  Life of the Beloved.  The main point of the book, as I see it, is that
we need to realize that GOD is saying to us, “You are My beloved.  In you My
favor rests.  I take delight in you because you are My beloved.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How do I respond to today’s reading and my reflection?
Obviously, I want to do what I can to foster the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>attitude of those who have the deep sense of faith, hope,
and love.  That means that I must be open to GOD’s being with me – GOD’s taking
a delight in me because I am GOD’s beloved.  I must spend time in prayer and
the reading of GOD’s Word and reflection.  I must also seek out those who exude
the holiness of GOD in their lives, especially those who have weathered the
storms of life and have kept the faith as they were battered about.  I also
must be willing to walk with those who travel through the dark valley, and who
do not sense the presence of the Lord Jesus, and I must assure them that they
are the beloved of GOD.  I should strive to bring them the faith, hope, and
love that they seem to lack.  Again, as usual, it does not mean that I spend
all my time with them “preaching” words, but rather I walk with them and let
them know that I am willing to be there for them, reminding them that they are
loved by GOD.  Somehow, they may experience that it is not just I who am with
them, but that GOD is with them even more than I am.  They may not be able to
dance and sing with GOD’s praise as part of today’s psalm suggested, but
hopefully, they will be able to understand and accept the other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>verse of the psalm that says, “For the LORD loves the
people, and GOD adorns the lowly with victory. . .for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD delights in GOD’s people.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I
experienced being the beloved of GOD and having GOD delighting in me? What
difference does that have on my faith, my hope, and my love? What can I do to
bolster the faith, hope, and love of others when they are plagued by the
negativity of self-rejection and doubt?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all faith, hope, and love. 
Through Your GOoDness, we are graced with Your presence.  You want us to be
able to rejoice and to know You are with us, delighting in us, Your beloved</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>children, especially as we travel the rough roads in our
journey to You.  Yet, we sometimes are so overwhelmed by life’s tragedies that
we are blinded from seeing You walking with us.  We become negative in our
attitudes and radiate negativity to anyone who comes near us.  We draw others
down to our level and refuse to be edified by the GOoDness in others.  For the
times we have let ourselves be unaware of Your constant presence with us, we
seek Your pardon and peace.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, strengthen
us and enlighten us so that we may not only be filled with joy in realizing
Your presence with us, but also, we may boldly, yet compassionately, radiate
Your presence to others who are traversing the hard paths in their lives. 
Inflame in our hearts a deeper sense of faith, hope, and love so that we may be
faithful disciples of Your Son, Jesus.  May we bring comfort and salus
(wholeness, holiness, healing, a sense of GOD’s salvation) to others as Jesus
did in His earthly life.  We pray and act in His name, for He is our
Master-Teacher and Lord, our Brother and Your Son, Who is both with us and also
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Joseph Calasanz:  https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-joseph-calasanz
(celebrated yesterday)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 2: 1-8;         Psalm 139: 1-3,
4-6;         Matthew 23: 23-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s care for us can be both gentle and also harsh.  St.
Paul speaks to the faithful at Thessalonika telling them that he is dealing
with them as GOD has dealt with him, as a gentle and loving parent caring for
GOD’s own children.  GOD, the loving Abba-Father, knows what drives Paul to
carry on his ministry.  This concept of GOD knowing everything about us and
still loving us is manifested in the Responsorial Psalm.  In the Gospel, Jesus
continues to chide the religious leaders who, like little children, focus on
minor details instead of seeing the “big picture.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul has a soft spot in his heart for the Thessalonians,
that is not to say that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>he does not have such a response to the other communities he
helped raise.  He recalls how after he baptized the first person, Lydia, in
what today is Europe, the people of Philippi arrested him, jailed him, and then
ran him out of town.  He went back to Thessalonika (modern day Thessaloniki). 
[Aside: I was able to visit Philippi and Thessaloniki in the summer of 2018.] 
Yet, as a loving foster parent, Paul feels a specialness for those whom he has
brought to spiritual life and who have responded well to his compassionate
ministry.  Paul stresses that what is important and salvific (saving) is not
what the Thessalonians do, but GOD’s ability to see into their hearts as GOD
sees into Paul’s heart.  GOD knows what attitude everyone has, and GOD knows
when we are trying to cooperate with the gifts that GOD bestows on us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is from one of my favorite psalms (139). 
It speaks of GOD knowing us better than we know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ourselves.  GOD knows what we are thinking and what we will
say before we even open our mouth.  GOD loves us and wants the best for us,
even if we are not fully aware of the love GOD has for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus’ concern for the salus (wholeness,
safety, salvation) of the religious leaders drives Him to point out their
faults and their misguided ways.  They are so concerned about the minute
details of the law that they fail to see the more important aspect of having a
relationship with GOD and with the other people whom GOD has put into their
lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They worry about the tithe on the smallest herbs, but they
fail to give to GOD what is really important, their love and devotion and their
concern for others.  They want to make sure that they do not eat a swarming
creature (a tiny gnat) but do not see that the big picture of what they are
allowing to enter their minds and bodies.  They care more about external
display (the polishing of the outside of the cup and the accouterments of their
lives) and fail to realize how ugly and dirty are the insides (of both the cup
and their lives).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am reminded of the
life of a parent.  As children grow up and they start to develop their own
personality, parents can almost predict what their children are going to say
and what they are about to do.  That does not mean that the parents always like
the choices the children make, but the parents have a sense of how the kids are
going to act.  And because the parents love the children, the parent sometimes
has to be harsh in directing their offspring away from doing things that show
the kids do not fully understand the repercussions of their thoughts and
deeds.  The children are not able to see the overall picture in the same way
that the adult parents can because of my many more years of life experiences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul, in the First Reading, describes himself (and GOD)
as the parent who “knows” what the “young” believers are doing, in a similar
way that a loving parent “knows” what her/his children are about to say or do. 
In the Gospel, Jesus, like a loving parent who needs to re-direct wayward
offspring, challenges the attitude and behavior of those who should have known
better.  It reminds of the times when parent have to say to her/his children
(as my parents said to me), “What were you thinking in doing that action?” 
Jesus chides the religious leaders out of a true concern for them and their
being a part of His Abba’s Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel called to examine my life and my attitudes to see if
I am really in line with GOD’s plan for my life.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>question I ask myself is not only “am I doing the right
thing?” but “am I doing it for the right reason?” – to reflect the love that
GOD has for me and to share that love with others.  I also realize that I need
to be challenged in those areas of my life that still need to be re-adjusted so
that they are compatible with the overall picture of salvation of which the
Lord Jesus intends me to be a part.  Yes, at times I have been a blind guide
and hypocrite.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to re-examine my life and be sure that I am as much
on target with GOD as I can be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to realize that GOD is aware of my innermost thoughts
and attitudes and that the Lord Jesus is there to channel me in the right
direction, if I am but open to the divine prompting.  Thus, I can repeat with
earnest the words of the psalmist today, “Behind me and before, You hem me in
and rest Your hand upon me.  Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; too lofty
for me to attain.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my response
when I realize that GOD knows my every thought and action even before I think
or do them?  How can I make myself more aware of GOD’s plan by trying to see
the big picture from GOD’s viewpoint rather than my narrow one?  What can I do
to show my love and care for others as they journey along the way to the house
of our Abba, Who happens to be GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all knowledge.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have been loved by You in such a way that You care about us more
than any earthly parent cares for her/his children.  You know us through and
through, and still, You love us and give us free will.  You know what we do or
say before it happens, because</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are the Creator and loving Parent.  We, like all
children, have sometimes chosen a path that is not what You would have us
follow.  You gently, and sometimes firmly, call our attention to our wayward
acts.  You correct us with enough force to re-direct our attitude and actions. 
For the times we have not taken Your loving correction, we seek Your pardon and
forgiveness.  Continue to allow Your Holy Spirit to work in our lives so that
we can stay on the right path to You.  We thank You and praise You for the
sending of Your Son, Jesus, and for His being our Guide, Master-Teacher, and
Redeemer.  It is in His name that we lift up this prayer, for He is one with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All three of our scripture passages are continuation of
scripture verses which were read earlier this week. Again, we see a sharp
contrast between those who are faithfully aware of GOD’s Word and GOD’s
presence in their lives, and those who act pious, yet all their actions are
contradictory to the inward attitudes (which deal with their relationship that
is away from GOD).  St. Paul continues to praise the people of Thessalonika for
living lives that manifest they have not only heard the Word of GOD but have
put it into action in their lives.  The Responsorial Psalm speaks of the
presence of GOD always with people, and their never being able to escape GOD’s
searching them out.  In the Gospel, Jesus continues His criticism of the
attitude and behavior of some of the religious leader of His day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul speaks to the faithful Thessalonians as a loving
parent to the children of whom the parent is proud.  The Thessalonians have
responded in a very positive way to the teaching of Paul, and Paul realizes that
the faith that they received from his preaching is the work of GOD, not just
the mere work of the human agent, even though Paul worked extremely diligently
to share the faith with the community of new believers in Thessalonika.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist realizes that there is no place to escape the
presence of GOD. GOD is always aware of each person’s place and seeks to be
with everyone</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who is open to the LORD.  All one has to do is be disposed
to GOD’s revealing the divine presence, and GOD will welcome even the wayward
back with open arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus again speaks harshly to some of the
leaders of the faith of His day.  He compares them to white-washed tombs that
look beautiful externally but are filled with decaying bodies and all sorts of
other putrid items.  Jesus’ second comparison today refers to how some of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>religious leaders of the past had persecuted and killed the
prophets of GOD who spoke GOD’s Word and the same leaders who later built
special tombs to honor the dead prophets.  Those to whom Jesus addresses the
sharp words are more like the leaders who killed the prophets than those who
honored the prophets’ memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having been to Israel and seen the white-washed tombs, I am
quite familiar with imagery Jesus used to describe the false teachers of His
time. The façades of tombs were painted white and decorated to honor the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dead, but inside the raised up and beautiful looking
sepulchers were bodies that were starting to become like the dirt which covered
them.  Especially for the Jewish people of Jesus’ days who believed that
touching the dead made them ritually impure, the comparison would have been
quite powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge for me that flows from today’s readings is to
see where I am in my relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father, in
union with the Holy Spirit.  Am I like the people whom Jesus chastises in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>today’s Gospel, who only are concerned with the outward
appearance and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>looking pious in other people’s eyes? Or am I more like Paul
and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thessalonians in trying to hear what GOD is saying and
seeking to put my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faith into actions? It is easy to try to put on a nice show
so that others will think well of me.  Yet, if people look close at the false
façade that I sometimes put on, they will see the filth which underlies my
false external covering. It is harder to take the time to listen to GOD’s Word
and see how it applies in my interaction with the people whom I meet on a daily
basis, especially my family members, any of the co-workers I may have, and
those with whom I come in contact in the parish or community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing that can help in my hearing GOD’s message and
putting my faith into action is the realization of which the psalmist spoke in
today’s psalm.  If I am conscious of the fact that GOD is always with me, no
matter where I am and no matter what I am thinking or doing, then it becomes a
bit more easy to do what GOD wills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the poem by Francis Thompson entitled The
Hound of Heaven (see Video of the Day below). In the poem the author speaks of
how he tries to escape GOD Who always seems to be after him.  He fears that GOD
is chasing him because of what he has done wrong.  It is not until the end that
author realizes that it is because of GOD’s love for him that GOD is always
pursuing him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also recall a song by Don Francisco entitled Adam, Where
Are You? (See Song of the Day below.)  That song quotes the words GOD speaks to
Adam after the fall (Genesis 3: 9).  The song not only is GOD speaking to the
hiding Adam (and Eve) but to all of us, the descendants of Adam and Eve, and
who are sinners like our first ancestors.  Since all of us are also like Adam
in that we are “human,” “clay of the earth,” “mortal,” GOD keeps asking the
hiding sinner, “Adam, where are you?”  It can be fearful to realize that GOD is
always seeking us out, especially after we have missed the mark with our
sinfulness.  GOD is constantly pursuing us asking us, “Where are you?”  And the
reason GOD is vigilant in searching us out is that GOD wants to have a few
words with us. The words that GOD wants to have with us are not the words we
dread such as “Boy, you blew it again.” or “How many more chances should I give
you?” or “That’s the last straw!”  The few words that GOD speaks to us are “I
forgive you.  I want you to come back to me.  I love you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced “The Hound of Heaven” – GOD – searching me out?   What “message”
did I receive from GOD when I became aware of GOD being with me?  What has been
my experience of knowing how much the Lord Jesus loves me? Does becoming more
aware of GOD’s presence help me to avoid sinning? What can I do to reassure
others of the loving and compassionate care of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, omnipresent (“present
everywhere”).  Through Your GOoDness You have searched us out even when, or
especially when, we have turned our back on You and deviated from the path You
have set before us.  You speak loving, yet challenging, words to us, to draw us
back to the straight and narrow way, so that we can continue our journey to
You.  You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to us to be our Master- Teacher and to be
the Way that/Who leads to You.  He has given His life as a sign of Your and His
love for us. For the times we have taken the wrong direction and tried to hide from
You, we ask for Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the guidance of Your Holy
Spirit, get us back on the right path and help us be aware of Your loving
presence with us at all times.  We lift up our prayer of thanks and praise to
You together with Your Son, Who is our Brother and Master-Teacher and the Way,
the Truth, and the Life, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Augustine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Augustine:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-augustine-of-Hippo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 3: 7-13;     Psalm 90: 3-5a,
12-13, 14 and 17;      Matthew 24: 42-51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today urge attentiveness to the
responsibilities of being one of the faithful.  St. Paul speaks to the
believers at Thessalonika, urging them to be persistent in the practice of
their faith until he has time to return to them or until the Lord Jesus
returns.  The Responsorial Psalm urges us to number our days aright so that we
will be prepared to meet the LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus warns His disciples,
especially their leaders, to be prepared for the un-expectant return of the
Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul expresses his gratitude to GOD for the faith that
the Thessalonians have demonstrated, but he is also concerned that they may not
be living out that faith fully.  This may be because his first visit to
Thessalonika was brief (about three weeks according to Acts 17: 2).  Paul wants
the best for his inexperienced community of faith, especially since Paul
believes at this point in his missionary experience that the Lord Jesus would
be returning very soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist expects GOD to visit the Chosen People soon. 
With GOD’s revisiting of the people, their joy will be increased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whether the psalmist thought that GOD would come in human
form is not known, but it is obvious that he believed that as the people were
aware of GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presence, their lives would be enriched.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus tells His disciples to be awake and
ready for His return.  These words probably had a great impact not only for
Jesus’ disciples during His earthly life, but also for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the early Christians as they awaited the Second</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coming of Jesus at the end of time (which many believed
would be during their lifetime).  Jesus wants all of those who invoke His name
to be ready no matter when He returns.  If they are prepared for Him, they will
not be caught off guard.  Being vigilant, however, takes thought and action,
just as defending one’s house against thieves takes thinking and preparation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I realize that sometimes
others and myself take the Lord Jesus’ coming as something in the future, the
distant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>future.  It is similar to thinking about death.  Yes, we
know that death is part of life.  We know, in some sort of mental way, that
each of us will die, but we don’t act as if our death could come at any time,
even today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don’t mean this reflection to be morbid.  In fact, I think
that being ready for death can be, as the psalmist today suggests, a time of
great joy.  With the death of my parents and close friends over the last few
decades, and the discussion with a former classmate of mine about our aging and
the effects on our bodies, I have had time to think about death.  Recently I
also thought about death, again, not in a morbid sense but in the sense it is
another step in my life process.  Having read the book,  Heaven Is for Real,
and the book,  Imagine Heaven, I am even more sure of what lies beyond death.  
Heaven is for Real is the reflection of the father of boy who was almost four
years old when he died and went to heaven and returned to share with his
parents what he experienced, happenings which could not be explained in any
other way than he actually went to heaven.  The book,  Imagine Heaven, is a
reflection on the real-life experiences of people who have had NDEs (Near Death
Experiences).  I also watched the TV series Proof which relates a dying, rich
man hiring a medical doctor to find out if there is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>scientific proof of an afterlife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet thinking about death, which is one way we will meet the
Lord Jesus, should help us prepare for the next step in our existence. We
should not be going around all gloomy and with long faces, but we should be
preparing to live to the fullest way we can.  It should inspire us to do our
best and be ready to face the Lord Jesus, whether that be at the end of our
personal lives or at the end of time (in case we live until the Lord Jesus
comes back for all of us).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of those about whom I read, and to whom I have
talked personally, who have had a “near-death” experience or who have medically
died and then have come back to life, like the young boy in the book, Heaven Is
for Real.  Their experience of death and what lies on the other side makes them
more motivated to do GOD’s will and help others, and it removes any fear of
dying.  They “know” what is on the other side of death and that impels them to
be more upbeat and positive in their living and in their service of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The way we can prepare for our end (personally and/or
collectively) should be in a way that we would not feel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>guilty if the Lord Jesus calls us home this very minute. I
remember hearing a homily in which the preacher mentioned that he was asked by
his superior what would he do if Jesus comes back again today.  The response
was:  keeping on doing what GOD wants me to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our lives should reflect the joy in knowing GOD’s love
experientially and being able to share that GOoD News with others.  Preparing
for the eventuality of our meeting GOD is more important (and more sure) than
preparing for an earthquake or hurricane or forest fires or a drought.  We
should be as prepared for the Lord Jesus’ coming, spending time with even more
thought and determination than packing up supplies in anticipation of a natural
disaster. It should not be a scary thing, but rather like preparing for a
well-earned vacation to our favorite destination.  The more we prepare
ourselves mentally and do things in preparation for that vacation, the more we
will have time to really enjoy it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us join the psalmist today and prepare for the LORD’s
return, saying: “Teach us to number our days aright, that we may gain wisdom of
heart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often do I
think about death and the life hereafter? What are my thoughts about my own
dying? How am I preparing myself for my death and transition to eternal life?
Would I live my life differently if I knew I was going to face death today? 
What can I do to help others face the inevitability of their deaths in a
positive way?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all events in life.  Through
Your GOoDness we have our earthly lives.  Yet, that is not the fullness of life
that You want us to experience.  You desire that we share the eternal life of
joy with You and Your Son in the place You have prepared for us from the
foundation of the world.  We have sometimes focused and planned on the
specialness and GOoD times of this life with the results that we have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>failed to remember that this life is only a mere shadow of
the GOoDness that awaits us in the next life.  Through the power of Your Holy
Spirit, gives us the wisdom and strength to prepare for the coming of Your Son,
whether that be at the end of our individual lives or at the end of the world
as we know it.  We lift up this prayer of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>praise and thanks to You, together with Your Son, Who is our
Brother and Master-Teacher and the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  He is the One
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Martyrdom of John the Baptist:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/martyrdom-of-saint-john-the-baptist</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 4: 1-8;        Psalm 97: 1 and
2b, 5-6, 10, 11-12;      Mark 6: 17-29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD desires our holiness.  St. Paul reminds the people of
Thessalonika of this fact.  The psalmist describes this same idea in the words,
“The LORD loves those who hate evil.”  In the Gospel, we hear the account of
the death of the holy man, John the Baptist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading, St. Paul urges the faithful
Thessalonians to seek an even closer relationship with GOD by striving more
diligently to live a pure and holy life.  This exhortation particularly
concerns the matter of chastity.  Paul describes the importance of having a
licit and valid marriage relationship and avoiding any sort of improprieties.
This is not just Paul’s thoughts; it is what he sees as the will of GOD that
brings us holiness (a closer relationship with the Lord Jesus).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist describes the reason to rejoice if one is doing
what is right.  Holiness is seen as being able to rejoice and be grateful for
the blessings that GOD bestows.  That should</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lead to living a life in accordance with GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since today is the memorial of the death of John the
Baptist, the Gospel relates the imprisonment and ultimate death of John at the
hands of Herod.  Herod is a confused individual. He senses the holiness of
John, but is also challenged because if he accepts what John preaches, he would
have to change his royal lifestyle.  When push comes to shove, Herod falls</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prey to looking important in the eyes of his friends and
acquaintances rather than looking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD in GOD’s eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings speak to me about what makes a person holy. 
Holiness is not primarily a reward for our actions.  Holiness comes from
awareness of how holy GOD is and the fact that Jesus has called us into a holy
relationship with His Abba-Father.  We are called to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflect that holiness as we serve others.  Paul was aware of
that concept of holiness as he served the Christians in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thessalonika, with whom he had prepared to share GOD’s life
as a loving foster-father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John the Baptist was a man of holiness also.  Because he
sensed the coming of the Messiah, he felt a need to bring that GOoD News to
others and prepare them for the coming of the Messiah, just as loving spouses
do for their spouses.  John had experienced the closeness of the Lord Jesus
while he was yet in the womb of his mother, Elizabeth, as Mary (pregnant with
Jesus) visited and assisted her older cousin, Elizabeth.  John’s closeness to
GOD can also be seen in the parallels that existed between his death and the
death of Jesus.  Both came before civil authorities who were amused and
confused by the person whose death they had the power to enforce.  Both John
and Jesus met their death because others hated them and their challenging
Message.  Both had friends who took their dead bodies and honored their holy
bodies by seeking a proper burial.   Their lifestyle was a result of the
holiness they had received from GOD the Abba.  They lived out their holiness as
we live our lives with wisdom given to us by GOD. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each one of us is called to holiness and wisdom.  Again,
this is not first and foremost a call to behave rightly or think correctly.  It
is primarily a gift from GOD to draw us ever closer to the Loving Parent Who
bestows the gift of holiness upon us.  Our behavior should flow from the
realization of the relationship of being adopted daughters and sons - the
relationship that we are being offered and the desire not to put anything in
our lives that would strain or destroy that relationship with GOD our Abba, and
our brother, the Lord Jesus.  It takes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s wisdom to be able to act in holiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, like Paul and John the Baptist, we are called to
continue the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>holiness offered to us by GOD, our loving Parent, by our
continuing acts of charity, deepening our relationship with the Lord Jesus (our
Brother), and being willing to offer our lives as witnesses (martyroi) to the
GOoD News of having a relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba, in the
unity of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I reflect on
my call to holiness, what thoughts come to mind? Do I perform acts of charity
for my benefit (to make me look holy in other people’s lives or to get a tax
break) or do I do it because of real concern for others and wanting them to experience
a closeness to GOD, our loving Abba? What can I do to give witness to others of
their call to holiness and to a deeper relationship with the Lord Jesus, our
Brother, and with our Abba?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all holiness, and our loving
Abba.  Through Your GOoDness You desire us to share in Your very life of
holiness.  Your gift of being able to be in relationship with You is what makes
us holy.  Yet, sometimes we have taken that gift for granted or chosen other
things instead of the gift of Your life of holiness.  For that we seek Your
forgiveness.  Continue to send Your Holy Spirit into our lives so we may
reflect on the gift of Your holiness, especially as it was presented by Your
Son, Jesus.  May we gratefully accept the gift You give us and share it with
others so that they may also enjoy the fullness of Your life.  We make this
prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Brother, Who is our
Master-Teacher and Who has died and rose to demonstrate the holiness of life
that You desire us to have.  He is the One Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Jeanne Jugan:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-jeanne-jugan</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 4: 9-11;         Psalm 98: 1,
7-8, 9;         Matthew 25: 14-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD gifts us, we must respond.  The First Reading describes
how the Thessalonians are being urged to continue to develop in their love for
others because they have been loved by GOD.  The Responsorial Psalm speaks of
the peace, justice, and equity which the LORD GOD bestows on the Chosen People
that should lead to their singing GOD’s praise.  In the Gospel, Jesus shares a
parable with His disciples about a master who dispenses gifts upon his servants
and expects them to use the talents they have been given and to give the master
a GOoD return on his investments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul writes to the faithful in
Thessalonika expressing his pleasure on how well they have learned about, and
put into practice, the concept of love.  Because GOD has demonstrated to them
and taught them about divine love, they in turn have shown fraternal love
(philadelphia) for one another.  Paul urges them to continue to develop their
ability to love each other and he gives them some practical ways to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>live in love:  by living in tranquility [the actual Greek
word [hesuchazein] means</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“not to be running around, but staying home”]; minding one’s
one business; and doing one’s work with one’s own hands.  Thus Paul wants them
to show love for each other by not being busybodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist exhorts the People of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD to praise the LORD because GOD has already shown divine
favor toward them in winning victories for them, dealing with them with justice
and equity. GOD once again is seen as the originator of the action.  The people
must respond to the LORD’s action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus compares the way GOD deals with
individuals to the way that a master of an estate who commissions his servants
to take care of things while he is gone.  The master gives a different amount
of money to his servants depending upon their ability.  What is interesting is
the English word “talent” comes from the Greek word (talantos) for the money
given to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>servants.  Each servant is given the freedom to use the
amount of talents he is given to gain more talents for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>master.  Two of the servants double their talents.  The
third servant fears the master and is afraid of losing the talent he is given,
so he buries it.  When the master returns, the servants are called to show how
they have made GOoD use of the talents they have been given and can give the
master a return on his investment in them.  The master praises the efforts of
the two servants who risked all they had been given in order that they might
give back to their master upon his return and give it to him as double what
they had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>been given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD invests a lot into each of us.  GOD gives us talents and
gifts.  GOD expects some sort of return on the investment GOD has given each of
us.  Some of us use what GOD has given us and we develop in a way that enriches
not only us, but also those around us.  Others of us fear to take risks of
using the benefits we have received from GOD.  We hide our talents and
abilities and do not use them.  We think it is better to be able to return to
GOD exactly what we been given, rather than to risk failing and losing our
GOD-given talents.  Yet it is when we are willing to expend our talents and
gifts for the enrichment of others that we end up with more than we expected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of a song that I used to sing with a church
choir.  It is by Kurt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kaiser and is entitled Pass It On (See Song of the Day
below).  What is key to this </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>song is that Love is what is given by GOD.  That is the
greatest talent, gift, or ability that GOD gives us because it is a gift of the
very essence of GOD because GOD is love (1 John 4).  GOD’s love begins as just
a spark in our lives.  As that spark begins to ignite into a flame, the flame
can be passed on to others.  The song reminds us, that if we share the spark of
GOD’s love, “soon all those around can warm up in its glowing.”  Yet, if we try
to hoard GOD’s love, it dies out and loses its enlightening and enriching
ability to touch our lives and the lives of those around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also call to mind a song that was used by our youth group
for retreats and other gatherings.  It is a call, Don’t Let the Fire Die by
Stephen Curtis Chapman.  It speaks of the need to prevent the fire (which GOD
has given) from burning out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we are willing to risk all that we have in order to pass
on and enrich others with the love we have been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>given by GOD, then GOD will say to us, as the master did to
his two servants in the Gospel today, “Well done, my GOoD and faithful
servant!  Since you were faithful in small matters, I will give you greater
responsibilities. Come, share your Master’s joy!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  With what talents
has GOD gifted me? How have I used those talents for GOoD – both my own GOoD
and the GOoD of others? Have I experienced the joy and enriching process of
sharing what I have been given?  Who might benefit today from my passing on
what I have been given?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all gifts and talents. 
Through Your GOoDness, we have been given abilities and blessings beyond what
we deserve.  You have asked us to make GOoD use of what You have bestowed upon
us.  Yet, sometimes out of fear, sometimes because of selfishness, we have
covered over the talents You have given us.  For our failure to use the gifts
You have given us, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to inspire us
with Your Holy Spirit and the example of our Master-Teacher, Your Son, Jesus. 
Help us to risk all, so that we and others may be enriched by the flame of Your
love.  May we continue to accept the love You give us and pass it on, so that
others may experience Your joy-filled love.  Help us to never let the fire of
Your love die in our lives.  To You we give back all that You have invested in
us, with interest and love, as we join Your Son in praising You.  For He is our
Master-Teacher and Lord, the dispenser of all Your loving gifts, our Savior,
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Sirach 3: 17-18, 20, 28-29;            Psalm 68:
4-5, 6-7, 10-11; Hebrews 12: 18-19, 22-24a;          Luke 14: 1, 7-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings today challenge us to look at our relationships
in dealing with others. The passage from Sirach advises us to be humble in our
relationships with others. The Responsorial Psalm describes the relationship
GOD has with those who are lowly and needy. The author of the Letter to the
Hebrews describes how the relationship between GOD and those who seek to have a
relationship with GOD, has moved to a new and more intimate and attainable
closeness,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in and through Jesus. In the Gospel, Jesus describes the
humility that should mark the way we relate to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humility is central to the pericope (excerpt) from Sirach.
These words of a religious man to his son are powerful. Bestowing gifts on
others is meaningless unless they are given in humility, that is, given in a
way that respects the receiver and does not make the receiver feel belittled.
The more gifted and an important a person is, the more he/she must be humble
and act unpretentiously. A truly humble relationship is based on mutual respect
and acceptance of the other person as an equal even when there is no apparent
equality, except in the eyes of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial describes the relationship that the almighty
GOD has with those who are the least of the lowly. GOD is a loving parent to
those who have lost their earthly parents. GOD is the source of protection for
those who are without any resources for housing. GOD is the source of richness
for those who are deprived of all freedom and value, even if the loss of
freedom and values is the result of their own doing. The obvious conclusion is
that if our Abba-Father, Who happens to be GOD, can be so gracious to the
outcasts, we must do likewise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section of the Letter to the Hebrews, the author
describes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that GOD was revealed to the Hebrews of old in awesome and
terrifying signs: blazing fire, gloomy darkness, storminess, and loud sounds.
The same GOD Who is revealed now in and through Jesus to the new Chosen People
is known by other signs: festal gatherings, assembly of peoples, and renewed
spirits of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people. The change in focus is based on a new understanding
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has brought – not one of terror, but one of
awesomeness, not one of punishment, but one of mercy and joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ presence at a dinner feast in today’s Gospel prompts
Him to relate two teachings dealing with humility and relationships with
others. The first focuses on where one sits at a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>celebration banquet. It rings of practicality. By taking a
highly prized seat, one may be asked to move to a less prestigious spot,
whereas sitting at the least assuming position may lead to one being asked to
move forward. [Is that the reason so many Christians sit in the back</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pews in churches? Are they expecting to be asked to move up
to a more privileged place?]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second lesson, in today’s Gospel, commands that we
should reach out to those who have need of our assistance and have no way of
repaying us. We do not imitate the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoDness of our gracious GOD if we only reach out to those
who can respond in quid pro quo (tit for tat) manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This second parable is not as easy and practical as the
first. It demands we be humble, especially if we have been given much (which we
have, particularly as we reflect on how GOD has blessed us with a relationship
with the Lord Jesus). We are called to seek out </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who the Anawim - those who are “bent over” and
“lowly.” The word humility comes from the Latin word humus that means “earth”
or “dirt.” We are called to be down to earth and to be willing to get dirty as
we reach out to others, just as our GOD has come down to earth and mixed with
us “earthly” people in the person of Jesus. Yet how often do we get caught up
with our desire to keep up with, or surpass, the “Joneses” and everyone else,
and to live a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life marked by the pure and apparently clean surroundings.
We want to be known by the sophisticated company that we keep and by the
luxurious facilities surrounding us. [Keeping up with the Joneses is an idiom
in many parts of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>English-speaking world referring to the comparison to one's
neighbor as a benchmark for social class or the accumulation of material goods.
To fail to &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot; is perceived as demonstrating
socio-economic or cultural inferiority. The phrase originated in a comic strip
of the same name.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Humility, true humility, is not hovering in a corner and
falsely putting ourselves down. True humility is based on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>honesty – acknowledging who we are in GOD’s sight and how
the Lord Jesus has blessed us. It also requires that we have the same attitude
that Jesus demonstrated by His compassion and His reaching out to those who
truly needed to hear from His actions the GOoD News that He preached. To put it
succinctly, humility is not just thinking less of ourselves (degrading
ourselves), but rather, thinking of ourselves less (and thus, thinking of
others more).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is our role model and teacher. He humbly and honestly
spoke to His disciples saying, “Come to Me, and learn from Me for I am meek and
humble of heart” (Matthew 11: 29). Jesus also knew Who He was in the sight of
His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father and how His disciples should relate to Him and
He to them as demonstrated at the Last Supper: “Rightly, you, My disciples,
call Me Lord and Master, and that is Who I am, but if I, your Lord and Master,
have washed your feet, so you must do for others” (John 13: 13-14).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on Jesus’ humility and His willingness to
serve, I realize I have a lot to learn from the Master-Teacher Who came to
serve, not to be served (Matthew 20: 28). The more I desire to be in
relationship with GOD, the more I must be of service to those whom Jesus valued
as loveable. I must not dwell on myself and my needs, but I must think more of
others and their needs. In that way, I manifest that I am a disciple of the
Master-Teacher Who humbly came to proclaim GOoD News and to die in service of
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of
humility, what words come to my mind? How do I manifest humility in my
relationship with others? How can I more effectively reach out to those who are
most in need of my help in a caring, and yet not condescending, manner? Who is
most in need of my service today? This weekend? This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD, Loving Parent Who cares for all
of Your children, especially those most in need of Your help. Through Your
GOoDness, You have continually manifested Your love and care for Your
creatures. In the greatest sign of Your love, You allowed Your Son to humble
Himself and take on the nature of us mortals. Not only has He come to us as one
like us in all things but sin, but He demonstrates His compassion by His life
of service. In the finest act of humility, He gave up His life on the cross to
unite us more closely with You. He has called us to continue the proclamation
of Your GOoD News by our humble and loving service of those whom You have
places along our path to You. For the times we have lacked the true humility of
acknowledging Your gifts to us and we have failed to care for others, we seek
Your forgiveness and pardon. Continue to fill us with the empowerment of Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Spirit, so we may live out our callings as humble
servants of others. We make this prayer in union with Your Son, Jesus, our
Brother and Master-Teacher Who has died, is risen, and is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Rose of Viterbo:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-rose-of-viterbo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 4: 13-18;       Psalm 96: 1 and
3, 4-5, 11-12, 13;           Luke 4: 16-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings speak of how quickly people’s view of things
can change.  In the First Reading the Thessalonians are upset because some of
their beloved faithful have died before the return of the Lord Jesus.  St. Paul
speaks words of consolation to them.  The psalm reminds us that GOD is the
ultimate judge of all people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the people of Nazareth are excited to have
Jesus, their home town boy, return to them.  They are expecting great miracles
just as they have heard have been happening elsewhere.  Jesus ends His visit to
His home town with the people wanting to kill Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When St. Paul had first visited Thessalonika for a only few
weeks, he had told the people of the community that they should prepare for the
Second Coming of the Lord Jesus.  He had said that Jesus would return soon and
all who believed would never have to see the end of life.  Since Paul left,
some of the faithful have died and the Thessalonians are upset. They begin to question
what Paul had said, and to weep and mourn like the non-believers in town who
have no sense of eternal life.  Paul writes words of consolation and hope to
the Thessalonians telling them that those believers in Christ and who die will
experience eternal life for they will be the first to follow the Lord Jesus
back to heaven when He returns.  Paul has obviously had to re-think his concept
of the imminent (immediate) return of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Lord Jesus since Jesus did not return as quickly as he
had originally thought and some of the believers were dying.  Paul’s words give
some hope and consolation not only to the Thessalonians, but to all Christians
who experience the death of a loved one.  Paul urges all believers to mourn,
but not to mourn like those who do not believe in eternal life, for life is not
completely ended in death, and there is eternal life with the Lord Jesus, even
when we experience physical death.  Death is merely a transition from life on
earth to eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist declares that the LORD will come and be the
ruler and judge of all.  Christians have seen in this passage an image of the
Second Coming of the Lord Jesus.  Jesus will return at the end of time to judge
the living and the dead (as we say in the Creed).  For those who have been faithful,
it will not be a time of judgment, but a time of rejoicing as the Lord Jesus
welcomes us into the place that has been prepared for us for all eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we begin readings from the Gospel of Luke.  For the
rest of the weekdays of Ordinary Time we will listen to passages from this
Gospel.  In today’s passage, Jesus returns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from His first period of public ministry.  He has been
teaching, healing, and announcing the GOoD News in other areas in the Galilee. 
News of His miracles and preaching have reached Nazareth.  Jesus enters the
synagogue in Nazareth as all the local people gather to hear Him speak.  After
reading the scripture passage from Isaiah, He announces that He is the
fulfillment of Isaiah’s promises of the Spirit of GOD coming upon an Individual
Who will perform mighty signs.  They expect Him to perform some of the same
miraculous events that He has been doing elsewhere.  Yet, Jesus says that He
cannot do what He has done in other places because the people do not accept Him
for Who He really is.  They just see Him as one of their own fellow</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>citizens.  Angered, the people want to throw Him off the
edge of the cliffs on which the town is built. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to get locked into one’s own perception of how
things seem to be.  After Paul’s conversion, he believed that Jesus would
return in the very near future.  He began preaching that concept as he traveled
around on his first missionary journeys.  The Thessalonians seized on the idea
of Jesus’ imminent return because Paul preached it so well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The people of Nazareth believed that they knew Jesus because
He had grown up in their midst.  When something comes along that causes people
to change their views, they find it difficult to relate to the new ideas.
Rather than change, many people (like the citizens of Nazareth) find it easier
to try to remove the source of the challenge to the new ideas.  It takes a
great deal of faith to alter one’s perspectives, especially when it means one
has to come to a new realization of how the Lord Jesus works in one’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings make me realize that I cannot lock GOD into my
personal understanding and perception but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must allow myself to be open to GOD’s movement in my life
and the lives of others.  Part of this realization came to me when I attended a
liturgical service at a Coptic Church, the church of Egyptian Christians.  Even
though</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the liturgy was in Arabic and Coptic, I was able to be
lifted to a different understanding of people’s faith in GOD. GOD is not
limited to only being worshiped the way I worship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also realize that my view of certain matters of faith have
grown as I have experienced the Lord Jesus’ touching people’s lives and my
life.  Faith is a gift from GOD.  Yet, it is not a once-and-for-all type of
gift.  GOD continues to challenge me to grow in my relationship with the Lord
Jesus.  I am not in the same place in my relationship with GOD that I was as a
youngster, a teenager, or even a young adult.  I am constantly coming to new
understandings of Who GOD is and how I can relate to the Lord Jesus.  Sometimes
I have had to change my whole approach to religion and my way of sharing my
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My relationship to GOD is a dynamic process.  I am always
having to reflect on how the Lord Jesus deals with me and how I deal with
others.  It is something truly awesome and exciting.  As I spend time thinking
about Who GOD is and how I can be in relationship with GOD, I am blessed.  I
can truly echo the words of the psalmist today and say, “Great is the LORD and
highly to be praised; awesome is [GOD].”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I handled
changes that have come into my life? Have I been open to the opportunity to
grow in and through the changes, or have I been dragged through the changes,
kicking and screaming? Do I see GOD’s action in the changes? How can I reassure
others who are facing changes in their lives, helping them see GOD’s presence
with them as they go through the changes?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all growth-filled life
experiences.  Through Your GOoDness, we are able to deepen our relationship
with You.  Help us to see that even our earthly life span will not be long
enough to fully grasp Who You are.  You will allow us to grow in knowledge and
love of You for all eternity.  Yet, because of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our human weakness, we have tried to define and limit Your
essence.  We have tried to pigeon-hole our understanding of You so that You fit
neatly into our comprehension.  For the times we have not been open to Your
continued touching of our lives, we seek Your forgiveness.  We thank You for
sending Your Son to us to help us better understand You and Your love for us as
demonstrated by Jesus’ teaching, ministry, death, and resurrection.  Continue
to pour Your Holy Spirit into our lives with the gifts of knowledge, wisdom,
and understanding, so that we might not only grow in our relationship with You
but also enable others to develop a deeper, personal relationship with You, not
based on our limited explanations, but upon Your working in their lives.  As
always, we make this prayer in and through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the
Truth made flesh, Who is our Savior and Lord, and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed John Francis Burté and Companions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-john-francis-burte-and-companions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Thessalonians 5: 1-6, 9-11;        Psalm 27: 1,
4, 13-14;          Luke 4: 31-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings today remind us that we must be prepared for
the return (Second Coming) of the Lord Jesus. St. Paul urges the faithful in
Thessalonika to be alert and ready for the Lord Jesus’ coming again, for the
time of Jesus’ return could be any time and no one knows when it will be.  The
Responsorial Psalm describes the hope of one who waits for the end when the
bounty of the LORD will be given to those who are ready.  In the Gospel, Jesus
travels to Capernaum and performs signs that are associated with the coming of
the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although St. Paul’s view of the imminent coming of the Lord
Jesus has changed a little bit so that he realizes Jesus may not come back as
quickly as Paul had originally thought, he still urges the Thessalonians to be
vigilant because Jesus will return at a time when some people do not expect. 
Paul also urges the believers to be people of the Light (GOoDness) and not
people of the dark (evil) and to act as if their time of meeting Jesus may be
at any moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He does not present this warning as something to be feared,
but rather as something that should be consoling and reassuring as they
joyfully act as if the Lord Jesus could return at any time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm has many parallels to the reading
from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1 Thessalonians.  The psalmist describes the light of
comfort as the LORD, the source of all GOoDness.  Although some seem to be
fearful (scared) of GOD, the psalmist seems to be joyfully anticipating the
time when all those who are GOoD, will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience the bounty of the LORD and be among the living. 
Like Paul, the psalmist urges vigilance and waiting for the LORD with courage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus has quickly left His hometown of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nazareth (after being threatened with death) and He travels
down to the area around the Sea of Galilee, to the town of Capernaum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There He performs some key signs:  preaching, casting out
evil spirits, and healing.  All three of these actions were believed to be
necessary events before the coming of the Messiah and the end of time. 
According to many Jewish believers, GOD would win a victory of GOoD over evil,
just at the time of the coming of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Messiah.  As the people see the authority of GOD present in
Jesus, many would have thought that this signifies the occasion when GOD was
going to restore the Chosen People through the coming of the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that being a believer
in GOD means to be alert and attentive to what the Jesus has promised.  I must
be ready for Jesus’ coming at all times.  It means that I should be living a
life that reflects my joyful hope that GOD will fulfill what has been
promised.  My deeds and thoughts should reflect that I want to accept the
invitation the Lord Jesus has given, that I be a part of the Reign of Light
forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that my actions do not earn my way into the Reign
of Heaven.  Rather my behavior and attitudes reflect my belief that GOD has
gifted me with the participation in the divine life.  I am to be living as if
Jesus could call me into the fullness of eternal life at any moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whether the time of my meeting the Lord Jesus in the Reign
of Heaven comes at the same time as His Second</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coming or my death precedes the Second Coming, it does not
make any difference.  I must be joyfully living a life that shows that I am a
child of the Light and not of the darkness.  I should be looking forward to
what is to come when I am living with the LORD GOD in the true land of the
living.  With this attitude, my whole demeanor </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should be positive, peaceful, and patient.  People should be
able to experience these attributes as I deal with them in a loving,
Light-emitting, and caring way.  Another way of saying that is that I, and all
other believers, should</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be living the “already but not yet” life of Reign of GOD. 
We should be aware that we have begun (“already”) to be part of the Reign of
GOD, but the fullness of it is yet to be (“but not yet”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not always easy to be people of the “already but not
yet.”  We are still required to live in the world that is filled with darkness
(evil), the world that is “not even yet” aware of the Reign of GOD.  The
darkness of the world is so powerful and pervasive that it can seem at times to
be overwhelming.  Yet, as children of the Light, we must bring the Light of the
Lord Jesus into the darkness and let it shine brightly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a practical way, it means that I must be a source of
Light (joy, warmth, coziness, hope, energy) to others, especially to those who
are enveloped in darkness.  I must treat those I meet with compassion and
concern, showing them that there is reason to have hope.  I must radiate a
sense of the coming of the Lord Jesus, not in any sort of “Pollyanna-ism,” but
with real interest in helping them alleviate that which weighs them down.  It
means I must be willing to be involved in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded of this as I have attended funerals and sent
messages of hope to other people who were burying some loved ones.  The deaths
span the ages from a baby to an elderly woman.  At one of the funerals, the
priest spoke about the importance of being supportive of those who mourn.  He
reminded those attending, that the funeral was primarily to help the family
still living to cope with the death of their beloved.  He urged the rest of the
attendees to continue being there for the ones experiencing their great lost. 
Thus, we are all to be light to those experiencing darkness, whether that be
the darkness of the death of a loved one or any other source of darkness, such
as we have experienced in the last few years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The promise (that the Lord Jesus gives us) is that if we
live as children of the Light and are consciously striving to be vigilant for
His coming more fully into our lives, then we will experience the GOoDness of
GOD in the divine Reign.  Let us act out in our lives the belief expressed in
the lines of today’s psalm:  “I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD
in the land of the living.  Wait for the LORD with courage; be stouthearted,
and wait for the LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What does it mean
to me that I must be part of the Reign of Light?  If GOD were to call me from
my earthly life today, would I be prepared? What more can I do to wait for the
Lord Jesus with courage and joy? How can I share this GOoD News with others
today, especially those experiencing some sort of darkness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all that is filled with
Light.  Through Your GOoDness, we have a share in that Light.  It enables us to
experience a foretaste of Your Reign of Light and Life, especially through the
ministry, death, and resurrection of Your Son, Jesus, Who is the Light and Life
of the World.  Yet, sometimes we have allowed the darkness to overcome us and
we have failed to spread the Light that/Whom we have received from You and Your
Son.  For those lapses, we ask for Your forgiveness and re-enlightenment. 
Continue to fill</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us with Your Holy Spirit Who brings us faith, hope, and the
strength to act in Your love.  May we be ever vigilant and constantly aware
that Your Son is returning.  May our lives reflect our belief that You have
invited us to be part of Your Reign of Life and Light.  We make this prayer in
the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, the Life and Light of the
World.  He is our Master-Teacher and Lord, Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-gregory-the-great</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Colossians 1: 1-8;         Psalm 52: 10,
11;          Luke 4: 38-44</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings speak of ministry.  St. Paul commends the
Colossians for their faith which has begun not originally from Paul’s
missionary efforts but that of Epaphras, who seems to continue to serve the
community until he once more joins with Paul.  The psalmist sees his ministry
is to proclaim the GOoDness of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus first heals Simon’s
mother-in-law and others in the area around Galilee and then He turns His
attention to other Jewish towns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul begins his letter to the faith community at
Colossae (in modern Turkey) by recognizing the faith that the people have in
the Lord Jesus as first preached by one of their own, Epaphras, a fellow
servant-minister with Paul. Paul appreciates the fact that people are coming to
believe no matter who is the first preacher of the faith in a community.  They,
like other Christians, are bearing the fruit of the faith, no matter who
planted the seed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm urges deeper trust in GOD.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the vocation of those who have experienced</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s GOoDness to proclaim that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoDness to others.  If one is witnessing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s mighty deeds to fellow believers, it should be a
source of edification and up-building for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel we are reminded that Jesus’ ministry is never
ending.  After the healings and exorcisms we heard about yesterday, Jesus is
invited to the home of Simon (this, by the way, is Luke’s first mention of
Simon who will later be called Peter).  Since Simon’s mother-in-law has a
severe fever, Jesus heals her.  (Could this healing be part of the reason for
Simon’s following Jesus?)  She immediately serves Jesus and the other guests. 
Jesus is then besieged by other people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seeking healing and being set free from demons.  Jesus
spends a great deal of time healing, only to be further sought after by more
people.  Jesus announces that His mission is to spread the GOoD News to as many
different people as possible.  [Just a side note:  today’s pericope ends by
saying that Jesus “was preaching in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>synagogues of Judea.” Many scripture scholars take “Judea”
to mean “the land of the Jews,” and not just the southern region called “Judea”
which is around Jerusalem.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ministry that Jesus, Paul, and the psalmist all perform
is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that of proclaiming that GOD is GOoD.  It is not important,
as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul implies, who it is that is proclaiming the GOoD News,
as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>long as the preaching is done.  (Obviously, if Jesus is the
One Who is announcing the GOoD News, it does make a difference, since He is not
only the Messenger, but also the Message.)  The message of salvation must be
preached both to those who have already begun to follow in the ways of GOD and
those who have never heard anything about GOD’s plan of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that I, too, am
being called to give witness to the Gospel (GOoD News) that Jesus came to bring
us – that GOD wants us to share in divine life now and forever.  The way I am
called to announce the message of salvation may be different than that of St.
Paul or the psalmist.  I must first make people experience that I am believer
in the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father and the Holy Spirit.  I may not perform
great miracles as Jesus did, but I can still touch people’s life with the same
compassion I have received from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must be open to whomever GOD sends my way or whom I
encounter as I go out in my daily activities, so </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that I can give witness to the faith with which I have been
gifted.  That does not mean I have to stand up on a soapbox and quote chapter
and verses at any who passes me.  I must, as St. Francis of Assisi is said to
have preached to his followers, “preach the Gospel at all times, and – if
necessary – use words.”  My first proclamation of GOoD News must be in the way
I relate to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My call to be a servant of the Word and a minister of the
Gospel is something I received when I was baptized and given a share in the
priestly, prophetic, and royal mission of Jesus Christ.  I, together with all
baptized Christians, am called to live a life that reflects my belief in the
GOoDness of salvation as seen in the ministry, life, death, and resurrection of
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes my preaching may be as simple as greeting someone
I meet with a smile and showing a sincere interest in how they are doing.  At
other times I may have to spend a lot of time with someone who is struggling in
their journey of faith.  Still other times I may be the instrument GOD first
uses to foster the seed of faith that has been planted in their hearts by the
Lord Jesus.  And although I should not seek to be padded on the back for my
service, I should not be surprised if some day (may not until we are in
heaven), someone shares their appreciation for my ministering to them.  I am
reminded of a song that I heard by Ray Boltz entitled “Thank You for Giving to
the Lord.”  (See Song of the Day below.)  It reminded me that we can have an
effect on people’s life, sometimes without our even knowing it.  This came up
at a Bible Study session when we talked about how we must always be modeling
what it means to be a disciple of the Lord Jesus, because we never know when
what we say and do will touch someone’s heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No matter what happens, GOD will give us opportunities to
share our faith with others, since that is what</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants us to do.  Then we will be able to echo the words
of the psalmist today and say:  “I will thank You always for what You have
done, and proclaim the GOoDness of Your name.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced someone showing their appreciation for something I have said or
done and I had not been aware of how much it had an effect on that person’s
life?  How did I feel when the person shared her/his gratitude for my
ministering to them?  How does the words of St. Francis strike me – “preach the
Gospel at all times, and – if necessary – use words”?  Who might benefit from
my preaching the GOoD News by my actions today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all GOoDness.  Through that
same GOoDness, You have given us a share in the ministry of Your Son, Jesus. 
We have been commissioned to proclaim Your GOoD News to others.  At times we
have neglected to be messengers of Your Message because of fears of failing, of
being unworthy or not being able to do the task, or not wanting to do what You
are asking of us.  For the time we have failed to be servants-ministers of Your
Word, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the guidance and direction
of Your Holy Spirit, fill us with the wisdom, strength, and faith we need to be
faithful servants of Your GOoD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>News.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son
and our Brother, Who has called us to share in His ministry, and Who has given
us examples of how to serve, and Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Rose of Viterbo:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-rose-of-viterbo</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Colossians 1: 9-14;       Psalm 98: 2-3ab, 3cd-4,
5-6;         Luke 5: 1-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants the message of salvation to be spread throughout
the world.  St. Paul in his letter to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Colossians remarks that he has continued to pray for that
community of believers as they grow in their practice of the faith.  The psalm
refrain is a reminder that GOD has made known the message of salvation, and
those who have received the gift of GOoD News should rejoice that GOD is
bestowing salvation on them and on others.  In the Gospel, Jesus first preaches
from Simon’s boat and then allows the fisher and his companions to catch a load
of fish.  Jesus uses the miraculous catch to show how others will be caught up
in the casting of the net of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul has taken a special interest in the Colossians,
even though he had not yet visited Colossae.  He rejoiced in the Colossians’
faith, just as he did in the communities he helped form.  He continues to pray
for them that they will develop and grow in their faith relation with the Lord
Jesus.  They must always remember that GOD has gifted them with salvation and
that they must deepen the relationship that was established with GOD’s gift of
salvation.  Their actions (GOoD deeds) should flow from a realization of their
being gifted by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist realizes that salvation is one of GOD’s
greatest gifts.  The response of those who receive the gift and see it being
given to others should be to praise and thank GOD for the further outpouring of
salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus wants more and more people to come to
an understanding of what a great gift salvation is.  Today’s Gospel passage
begins with Jesus instructing the people from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the boat owned by Simon (Peter).  After announcing the GOoD
News, Jesus tells Simon to lower his nets and to bring in the catch.  Simon had
been fishing all night (the best time to fish) and caught nothing.  He was
close to shore</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(where fish usually do not gather, especially on a warm
day).  Simon shows his respect for Jesus even though he questions Jesus’
knowledge of fishing.  When Simon catches so many fish that he needs help from
his fellow fishers, he realizes that there is something even holier about Jesus
than what he did before (remember in the previous chapter of Luke’s Gospel,
Jesus had healed Simon Peter’s mother-in-law from a severe fever).  Simon
proclaims that he is not worthy to be in Jesus’ presence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because he is a sinner.  Jesus invites Simon and his fishing
buddies to join him and cast the nets of salvation over people and pull them
into the Reign of Heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind me that salvation is GOD’s gift.  We do
not deserve to be blessed with salus (healing, wholeness, holiness, well-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>being, salvation) since, like Simon Peter, we are sinners. 
Not only does the Lord Jesus bestow salvation upon us,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but He asks us to help spread the message of salvation to
others.  We are asked to throw out the nets, but it is GOD Who supplies the
most important aspect of the process.  We are privileged to help in the catch
that GOD gives.  Part of the way we can be partners in the salvation process
(that comes only from GOD) is by praying not only for those who have not yet
accepted the gift of salvation (been caught in the net), but also praying for
those who have, that they might grow even more in the ways of faith and their
relationship with the Lord Jesus, just as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paul prayed for the believers in Colossae, even though he
was not the one who first cast the net of salvation and announced the GOoD News
of salvation to the Colossians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes I find myself taking the gift of salvation for
granted.  I have been a follower of the Lord Jesus from the time of my
childhood, even though I have sometimes fallen by the wayside, or fallen out of
or through the net. Most of the time I forget that my ability to be in
relationship with GOD is a blessing from GOD.  I don’t deserve it, I don’t earn
it.  I can’t buy it.  I need to be appreciative of the gift GOD has given me
and respond in praise</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and thanks to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only am I called to be grateful for the gift of
salvation that I have received, I must be willing to do whatever I can so that
others will also experience GOD’s gift of salus.  I must model the fact that my
life has been changed for the better because of my acceptance of GOD’s gift.  I
should be loving and caring to others because GOD has been that way with me.  I
must be forgiving and understanding of others, since Jesus demonstrated that
forgiveness and compassion are part of receiving salvation.  I should live a
life that invites others to receive the GOoDness that GOD wants them to have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Praying is one very important aspect of the process of
responding to the gift of salvation.  Through prayer I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am united with the Lord Jesus and with those who have or
will accept what GOD is bestowing on them.  I should pray to bolster and edify
the faith that people already have.  I should also pray for those who have not
yet experienced how GOD’s salvation can affect their lives in a positive way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, salus (healing, wholeness, holiness, well-being,
salvation – the sharing in the divine life of GOD) is truly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a marvelous thing.  Once we have experienced it, we should
seek to show our appreciation for it, work to allow it to enhance our
relationship with GOD, and do all we can to make it more acceptable to others
through our actions, words, and prayers.  We should join with the psalmist
today and say, “All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our GOD. 
Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; break into song; sing praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    What is my
understanding of salvation? When I contemplate my reception of salvation, do I
express my thanks to GOD and appreciate those who were instrumental in sharing
the GOoD News of salvation with me? What can I do to help “bring in” those who
are being gathered in the net of salvation? How can I model my gratitude to GOD
for sharing with me the gift of salvation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all salvation.  Through Your
GOoDness, we are invited to share in Your divine life that has been made
possible through the ministry, life, death, and resurrection of Your Son,
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We seek Your pardon and forgiveness for the times we have
taken the gift of salvation for granted, or even done things that have blocked
a further deepening of our relationship with You and Your Son.  Help us to look
to Jesus in order that we might see, hear, and experience what You have prepared
for us as part of our accepting Your gift of salvation.  With the continued
outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, help us to not only deepen our relationship
with You, but also to share the impact of Your gift with others.  We make this
prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who has saved us
by His incarnation, life, death, and resurrection, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Colossians: 1: 15-20;         Psalm 100: 1b-2, 3,
4, 5;         Luke 5: 33-39</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The role of Jesus in the plan of salvation is the focus of
the readings today, for me.  The passage from the Letter to the Colossians
emphasizes Jesus’ role in both creation and redemption.  The psalm describes
the close relationship between GOD and the people GOD has chosen.  In the
Gospel, Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that He is the new gift from GOD which
causes joy and celebration among His disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many scholars believe that St. Paul is quoting a liturgical
hymn in this section of his letter to the faithful at Colossae.  The words
declare Jesus’ supremacy among humans and His equality with His Abba-Father,
Who is GOD.  Jesus, in His human existence, is the perfect, visible image of
the GOD Who cannot be seen.  Jesus Christ is also pictured as co-creator with
His Abba in the beginning of all things (In some ways, the concept parallels
the Prologue to St. John’s Gospel:  1: 1-4).  Not only is Jesus the source of
unity of all things, but He is also the head of the Church and the source of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation through His bodily death on the cross.  This
passage is also the basis for some of the statements in our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Creed.  Thus, it is appropriate that Jesus’ resurrection is
the reason we can hope in eternal life after own death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist gives a glimpse into the joy that was
experienced by pilgrims once they had arrived at the Temple of the LORD in
Jerusalem.  Being in the presence of GOD was a time of great excitement.  It
was something that was truly awesome for those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who were able to come to the House of the LORD, especially
for the first time.  I am reminded of this in a book I have read, Three</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Days:  The Search for the Boy Messiah, by Chris Stepien.
Chapters 16 and 17 powerfully bring out how the pilgrims to the Temple rejoiced
when they were near and in the Holy City of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the religious leaders question Jesus and
imply that His disciples were inferior to the disciples of John the Baptist or
the disciples of the ruling party of the Jews because Jesus’ disciples did not
practice fasting and mortification.  Jesus compares Himself to a bridegroom who
gives joy to all those who are in attendance at the wedding festivities.  While
the bridegroom is present, there is no reason not to celebrate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the second part of today’s Gospel, Jesus also uses
analogies of not joining new with the old, because it will cause disaster to
link the two too closely.  Jesus is obviously the new manifestation of GOD’s
presence in even a more dramatic and awesome way than the Temple, the Ark of
the Covenant, and rituals of old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, the supremacy (or
“pre-eminence” spoken of in the First Reading) of Jesus is obvious.  Jesus is
the very presence of GOD in the world.  Even more so than when Christ was with
His Abba at the time of creation, Jesus (in His human existence) brings not
only life and existence to those in the world, but He also brings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation – that is the gift of divine life for all
eternity.  The fact that Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has come to share in our human life shows how close GOD
wants to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with us.  Jesus shared in our humanity completely (except
for sinning) even going to the point of sharing the end process of earthly life
– death – and a painful one at that on a cross.  Jesus’ resurrection is a sign
of the new life that He intends us to have after our own death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we take the time to realize the closeness of the Lord
Jesus Christ in our lives, we would not be able to do anything but to have a
deep sense of joy.  That does not mean that we will not have painful,
challenging, and really difficult days, but that we will have a sense of the
presence of GOD with us and a deepening of our hope in the fullness of life in
heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It also does not mean that we should not mortify ourselves
on occasions.  Fasting and mortification help us to empty (kenosis) ourselves
of that which just clutters up our lives and prevents us from being more aware
of GOD’s presence with us.  I remember talking with a Coptic (Egyptian) Christian. 
She mentioned that there are over 100 days of fasting each year in the Coptic
Church.  When it is time to fast, the people participate and do without food. 
Yet, the Coptic Church calls itself the Church of Joy, because when they
celebrate the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, they really celebrate with
huge feasts and copious amounts of fun and food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge for me is to get the correct balance between
emptying (kenosis) myself of that which is not necessary and filling myself
with the joyful presence of GOD.  It takes will-power and determination, but
the rewards are well worth the effort.  When we are able to be more aware of
our being in the presence of the LORD GOD, then we can express the same
emotions that the psalmist does in today’s psalm:  “Sing joyfully to the LORD,
all you lands; serve the LORD with gladness; come before the LORD with joyful
song.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I have a sense
of GOD being with me, causing me to have joy, even in the midst of the most
trying experiences? Do I sometimes practice fasting, to empty (kenosis) myself
of that which clutters up my life, so that I can be more open to the Jesus
Christ’s presence? Am I able to radiate to others the joyfulness of GOD’s
presence with me and with them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all creation.  Through Your
GOoDness we have human life.  Yet You have desired that we have more than mere
life on this earth.  You want us to be able to be in Your presence forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to reassure us of Your loving presence You allowed
Your Son, Jesus, to share in our humanity as a sign of Your plan – that we
share in Your divine life.  Just as Jesus emptied (kenosis) Himself during His
earthly sojourn so that He could relate more fully with us, You ask us to empty
ourselves of anything that prevents us from relating more fully with You and
with others.  For the times we have failed to realize Your presence and have
cluttered our lives with meaningless items and for the times we have not
rejoiced fully in the presence of Your Son with us, we seek Your pardon and
peace.  Continue to enlighten us and enliven us with the wisdom, strength, and
power that comes from Your Holy Spirit being with us.  We lift up this prayer
of thanksgiving and praise to You together with Your Son, our Brother and
Savior, Who has given up His life so that we might live with Him Who is now
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We continue to reflect on the role of Jesus in the divine
plan of salvation.  St. Paul reminds the faithful in Colossae that Jesus has
reconciled them to GOD through His death so that He could present them holy and
unblemished to GOD, His Abba-Father.  The psalm focuses its attention on the
fact that GOD is the source of help and salvation.  In the Gospel, Jesus
demonstrates that He is the Lord of the Sabbath as He defends His disciples’
breaking of certain Sabbath restrictions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul writes to the faithful Colossians and reminds them
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they have been gifted by GOD and elevated from their sinful
state in which they were alienated from GOD and during which they did not
experience the divine love in its fullness.  It is through the death of Jesus
that they have been made holy and immaculate, and able to enter into the
presence of GOD.  Paul also mentions that he is a minister of the GOoD News
because he also has been chosen to be part of the salvific plan of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist is aware that it is by GOD’s initiative that we
receive the help we need. GOD is the One Who defends,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>saves, and enables people.  The response of the people
should be praising the LORD GOD for the divine GOoDness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, when Jesus is questioned about His disciples’
breaking of the Sabbath laws by plucking and milling grain (with their
fingers), He first recalls how King David violated the laws of the Temple by
sharing with his soldiers the bread reserved for the priests.  His comparison
is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>meant to show that if King David could do such, then He
could even do so, for He is more important than King</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David.  He ends his rebuttal to the challenge offered by the
religious leaders by saying that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath,
that is, the need of Himself and of His disciples is more important than the
Sabbatical laws.  This is so since the purpose of the laws were meant to draw
people closer to GOD and what He was doing with His disciples was making them</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more aware of GOD’s presence rather than focusing on the
mere observance of the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that Jesus and His
Abba and the Holy Spirit manifest divine love for humanity by all that the
Triune GOD does.  GOD is always the originator of the means of our drawing
closer.  GOD desires that we be united with the GODhead, and thus Jesus became
human to raise us to the divine life.  GOD is able to rise above the
traditional, human</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>enforced laws, if raising above the laws enables us to be more
aware of the divine presence with us.  Jesus exceeds the expectations of the
Jewish faith by His incarnation, ministry, death, and resurrection and can
therefore exceed the strict observance of the law if it will make it possible
for people to experience the GOoD News that He came to bring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, that does not give me the right to abrogate laws
that I don’t like or find confining.  I must ask </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>myself not “what would I like to do in this situation and
how can I justify not observing the laws I don’t like?” but rather “what will
draw me closer to GOD in this particular situation, even if it means I might
not strictly adhere to the law?”  It makes me prioritize my life and see what
thoughts and action will make me more aware of GOD’s loving presence and/or
help others come to experience GOD more in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of what one preacher told the congregation
about their observing the regulations concerning fasting and abstinence:  “If
observing the law makes you more grouchy and impatient with those around you,
it is better that you don’t follow the regulations concerning fasting.”  The
purpose of rules and precepts is to help form us into better individuals who
can manifest GOD’s love for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recall that GOD wants us to willingly follow the
commandments as a sign of our thanksgiving for all that GOD has done for us. 
Yes, sometimes observing the law that we would rather not practice can be GOoD
discipline for us so that we can learn ways that will draw us closer into the union
with GOD.  That, after all, is why Jesus came and lived among us and was
willing to suffer, die, and rise – for us.  Our response and behavior should be
in thanksgiving to GOD’s GOoDness, or as today’s psalm says, “Freely will I
offer You sacrifice; I will praise Your name, O LORD, for its GOoDness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What is my
understanding and practice of laws, rules, and regulations?  Have I sometimes
been a strict adherent to the law at the expense of my relationship with others
and with GOD? Do I see the value of the discipline of keeping the rules as a
path to draw me closer to GOD and others?  How can I help others draw closer to
GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all rules and regulations. 
Through Your GOoDness, we are given guidelines to follow for the purpose of
drawing us closer to You.  Sometimes we have made the observance of the laws
more important than the relationship that they were meant to enhance.  For the
times we have strictly enforced the guidelines while belittling our
relationship with You and with others, we seek Your pardon and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>peace.  Through the preaching and example of Your Son, helps
us to focus on the intent of Your commandments</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– coming into a deeper relationship with You and through
that into a closer relationship with others.  Through the guidance and
direction of Your Holy Spirit, inspire us to go beyond the letter of the law to
its spirit, and work for the edification and holiness that come from a clearer
sense of what Your presence should mean for our lives and the lives of others. 
We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and Savior, Who
is the Lord of the Sabbath and all other laws, Who has shared our humanity so
that we might be lifted up to share in Your divine life, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Frédéric Ozanam:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/blessed-fr-d-ric-ozanam/  - His liturgical
feast is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>September 9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:        Wisdom 9: 13-18b;       Psalm 90: 3-4, 5-6,
12-13, 14-17; Philemon 9-10, 12-17;  Luke 14: 25-33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a disciple of the Lord Jesus takes a conscientious
decision on our part. Yet even the ability to make that decision is a gift from
GOD. The passage from Wisdom extols the virtues of seeking to share in GOD’s
wisdom and lifting oneself beyond the merely human level of action. The
Responsorial Psalm describes the frailty of human existence when compared to
the divine existence of GOD. In writing a letter to Philemon (today’s Second
Reading), St. Paul lifts the relationship of slave and master to that of brothers
in the Lord Jesus. In the Gospel, Jesus warns His disciples that being one of
His followers is a very demanding undertaking, which takes complete dedication
of mind, soul, and body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s selection from the Book of Wisdom compares human
wisdom to divine wisdom and remarks that there is no basis of comparison since
GOD’s wisdom is in another dimension compared to human thought. Yet, GOD is
willing to pour out the Holy Spirit upon mortals so that they can be lifted to
a level where they can share in GOD’s wisdom. When guided by GOD’s Spirit, one
can begin to consciously choose to align oneself with GOD’s plan and GOD’s
will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial continues the contrast between human
existence and divine existence. Our earthly life is only a very tiny section in
the continuum that marks GOD’s being. Yet, if we seek to be filled with GOD’s
wisdom, we can share in the work of GOD and GOD will bless the works of our
hands and we can then give glory back to the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As St. Paul is confined by his imprisonment, he writes a
letter to Philemon, a believer with whom he has had contact. Paul has been
blessed to have Onesimus as a companion during his confinement. Onesimus (the
name means “useful” or “beneficial”) had run away from Colossae where he had
been a slave of Philemon. After converting Onesimus to the faith, Paul is now
sending him back to his master, Philemon. Paul asks Philemon to look not at
Onesimus as a “useless” slave but a “useful” brother in the Lord Jesus. Thus,
Paul</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is challenging Philemon to rise to a higher level and treat
his slave in a way that shows their common bond in the Lord Jesus – a bond</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>marked by love and compassion. In the Gospel, Jesus
addresses these words to those</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who would be His disciples. Following the Lord Jesus takes
more than merely listening to what Jesus says. It means a whole change of mind,
heart, and soul. It demands renunciation of self, old ties, and a complete
commitment – mentally, physically, and spiritually – to being like the
Master-Teacher. A very important</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>aspect of this commitment is the mental resolve to act in a
manner that reflects one’s relationship with the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am struck with exhortations of today’s readings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a disciple of Jesus is a call to rise above our normal
human way of acting and to act in a “supernatural” way. “Supernatural” for me
means what the etymology of the word implies “above the natural.” It does not
mean “purely spiritual,” but implies a going beyond the normal, or being lifted
to a higher plane of action. We cannot rise to this </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>higher level of acting by our own doing. We can only do this
with GOD’s help, focusing on the life and ministry of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Master-Teacher, and with the guidance and empowerment of the
Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An example of one acting on this higher level is what Paul
asks of Philemon. Philemon has every right to not only have his slave
(Onesimus) back, but to harshly punish him for his running away. Paul is asking
Philemon not to continue the acceptable practice of his time of dominating his
slave, but to treat the once useless slave as a useful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>brother and co-worker in the Lord Jesus and in proclaiming
the GOoD News. For Philemon to do as Paul suggests will take an extraordinary amount
of strength and commitment, and the help of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar manner, Jesus is asking His disciples
(including us living today) to rise above our normal way of relating to family,
possessions, and living in general. We are to place our relationship with the
Lord Jesus as the primary relationship in our lives.  We must be completely
dedicated to the mission of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In part of a retreat which I have presented to groups
before, I reflected on the Marcan parallel of today’s Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two key words to Mark’s passage (Mark 8: 34-35) are ἁπαρνέομαι
(aparneomai) [rejection of self] and ὁμολογέω (homologeo) [belonging to the
Master and His cause, literally “same thought”]. As I view this aspect of
discipleship, I am reminded of the relationship that existed between
apprentices and master-craftsperson in ages past. When a young person wanted to
learn a trade, he would go to a master craftsperson. The artisan would not just
“teach” the would-be artist by giving him books or lecturing the youthful
learner. The disciple of the master would live with the artist, day in and day
out. The apprentice would learn not just the how-to aspect of the craft, but
the apprentice would take on the whole attitude and personality of the master.
The individuality of the disciple would dissolve as the learner would take on
the whole attitude and activity of the master. The understudy would have to put
his whole mind, soul, strength, and actions into becoming like his
master-teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After years of working under the master, when the young
apprentice finally “graduated,” he would present his work to the public. The
highest compliment that would be paid to the new artist would be for someone to
say, “I don’t know who you are, but I know who your master is because your work
is perfectly patterned on your master.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What we need to do as disciples (“disciplined learners”) is
to let go of our own prejudices (“making judgments ahead of time”) and selfish
ways and imitate our Master-Teacher. We must apply ourselves fully to the work
of the Master, consciously giving our all. Calling upon the guidance of the
Holy Spirit, we must renounce anything that prevents us from fully following
the Master. And hopefully, someday, someone will say to us, “I am not too sure
of who you are, but I know who is your Master-Teacher, for your work is a
reflection of Jesus.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: In what ways do I
reflect what is the most important aspects of my life? Have I striven to rise
to the “supernatural” level of acting beyond the merely human way of acting? In
what aspect(s) of my life do I still need to let go of my selfish ways? Can
people see Who is my Master by my actions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Creator and giver of all that is
GOoD. Through Your GOoDness, You have given us the perfect example of how to
live out our human life in a supernatural way. You have allowed Your Son,
Jesus, to share in our humanity in order to be the Master-Teacher. He continues
to invite us to be His disciples, His apprentices, and to continue doing His
work. Through the continued outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, raise us up beyond
our merely human way of acting, so that we can be reflections of the
Master-Teacher. Give us the strength, wisdom, and guidance so we can renounce
all that is hindering us from being disciples of Your Son. We make this prayer
in His name, Jesus, for He is our Lord, our Brother, and He has given us the
perfect example of loving service through His life, ministry, death, and
resurrection, and He is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/nativity-of-the-blessed-virgin-mary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Micah 5: 1-4a  or  Romans 8: 28-30;       Psalm
13: 6ab, 6c;        Matthew 1: 1-16, 18-23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today the Church celebrates the Feast of the Birth of Mary. 
Although there is no scriptural account of her birth, the Church has celebrated
her birth since at least the sixth century.  An apocryphal account of her birth
is preserved in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>non-canonical ProtoGospel of James.  The tradition that has
circulated since the first centuries of Christianity speaks of Mary’s parents
(Ann and Joachim – Santa Ana y San Joaquin in Spanish) being old and having no
children.  They pray to GOD and are told that they will have a child who will
be important in the history of salvation.  The Eastern churches celebrate the
feast of the Birth of Mary in September because that was the beginning of their
calendar year at the time.  The modern celebration of the Immaculate Conception
is calculated from this date back nine months to December 8.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our scripture passages today focus on the coming of the
Messiah.  That is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>very appropriate since it is Christ Jesus Who is the key
figure in salvation history. The position of Mary as His mother is related, in
a subordinate way, as is fitting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to her subordinate place of honor to her Son, Jesus.  The
passage from Micah is the prophetic promise that a male descendant of David
would be born of a woman and the male descendant would be the shepherd of GOD’s
flock of people.  The alternative First Reading from Paul’s Letter to the
Romans rightfully places Jesus as the First Born (most important human) of all
His sisters and brothers (fellow human beings who call upon GOD as
Abba-Father).  The psalm echoes Mary’s joyful submission to the will of GOD and
GOD’s allowing her to be the mother of the Savior.  The Gospel includes both
the genealogy of Jesus and also the account of His birth according to Matthew.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Micah, a prophet of old, forecasted that One from the line
of King</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David would be born.  This “Son,” or descendant, of David
would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>continue GOD’s plan for the salvation of GOD’s people.  The
One born of the woman (showing His earthly origins) would come to shepherd
(take care of and protect) the flock of GOD.  The birth would take place in
Bethlehem, the city of King David’s birth.  Thus the Promised One would be the
care-taker and savior of GOD’s holy people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the alternative First Reading, St. Paul sees GOoD coming
to all who love</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  Because GOD can see into the future, GOD can see how
different individuals will accept the GOoD News of salvation and therefore GOD
has predestination or foreknowledge of what people will do.  That does not mean
that GOD takes away free will from individuals, but GOD knows what choices
people will make even before they are born.  GOD can therefore bless and
justify them in advance.  Thus, it is GOD’s prerogative to grant certain
blessings ahead of time to Mary because of her future total acceptance of GOD’s
plan of salvation.  It is only appropriate that GOD would</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make the human vessel of the Divine Son’s human nature to be
pure and spotless and honorable from the first moment of her life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel (in its longer form) gives us the human ancestry
of Jesus from Abraham down to Joseph, His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>adoptive father.  The end of (or the shorter) Gospel for
today relates how Jesus’ birth came about.  It presents Mary as the human woman
whom GOD has chosen to be the mother of the Messiah.  Mary conceives by the
power of the Holy Spirit so that her Child has a human nature from her and a
Divine Nature from GOD.  This child is to be called Yeshua (Jesus) which means
“GOD saves.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings and the feast for today, I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>realize that Mary is to be honored (not worshiped or adored)
for her role in helping to bring forth the Savior of the world. Her consent to
GOD’s plan enabled the plan of salvation to be implemented as the Son of GOD is
incarnated (“fleshified”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary’s role is an important one, but is always subordinate
to the role of Jesus, the GOD-man Savior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, Mary is a GOoD role model for all of us in her
obedience to GOD’s will.  She also exemplifies what it means to be a servant of
GOD.  Her plans always included doing whatever GOD wanted her to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary, in St. Paul’s words, is the best example of what it
means “to be conformed into the image of GOD’s Son” even though she is Jesus’
mother.  Another title used frequently in modern times is Mary is “the first
and best disciple of Jesus.”  After she taught her Son and raised Him, she
learned from the Master-Teacher and lived as disciple (disciplined learner) of
Him.  She played (and still plays) an integral part in the plan of salvation. 
Let us join with Mary in praising GOD in the words of the psalmist today:  “Let
me sing of the LORD, ‘the LORD has been GOoD to me.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    How do I see
Mary’s role in the plan of salvation? What can I learn from Mary and her
submission to the will of GOD? What can I do to bring the message and ministry
of Jesus into the lives of people today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all salvation.  Through Your
GOoDness You bestow Your graces upon those who seek to do Your will, not
because their actions merit grace, but because Your grace empowers them to do
Your will.  We thank You for giving us the example of the obedience of Mary,
the Mother of Your Son.  We also thank Your Son, Jesus, for giving us His
mother as our protector and intercessor.  We recall how Jesus, dying on the
cross, entrusted John (and all of us) to her care and how He gave Mary to John
(and to all of us) to be our mother.   We ask that we may call upon Mary as one
of our intercessors to pray with us to Your and her</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Son.  As always, we give You all the glory, honor, thanks,
and praise together with Your Son and the Holy Spirit. It is in Jesus’ name and
by His power that we lift this prayer to You, for He is our Savior and Lord,
our Master- Teacher and Brother, Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Peter Claver</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Tue. of 23rd Week in Ord. Time)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Peter Claver  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-peter-claver</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Colossians 2: 6-15;              Psalm 145: 1b-2,
8-9, 10-11;             Luke 6: 12-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The compassion and love of GOD are obvious from the readings
today.  St. Paul urges the Colossians to remain faithful to the preaching they
have heard concerning GOD’s love for them.  The psalmist proclaims the gracious
compassion and mercy of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus appoints twelve individuals
as His apostles (“sent ones”) and cures the illness and maladies of those who
come to Him seeking help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul is concerned about what the
community at Colossae has heard since he left them.  It seems that some other
“teachers” have come among them demanding that the Gentile Colossians be
circumcised and forced to follow the Jewish traditions.  They are also
down-playing the divinity of the Jesus.  Paul challenges the believers to stay
faithful to the teaching that he gave while he was among them.  Their baptism
was more effective in allowing them to have a share in divine life than going
through Jewish rite of physical circumcision.  In baptism they died to their
old, sinful ways and were</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>raised up with the Risen Lord Jesus.  Jesus’ death and
resurrection are the source of their new life.  Baptism is a sharing in the
life of Jesus, both His earthly life of service and His heavenly life with His
Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm is both a reminder that GOD is gracious</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and compassionate, and also a call to return praise and
thanksgiving to GOD for all that GOD has done.  All GOD’s actions are
demonstrations of how much GOD loves and cares for people.  The rightful
response is to extol and bless GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus spends the night in prayer.  This is
His re- creative time to be with His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba-Father.  It renews Him after a busy day and helps Him
focus on what He will do on the next day. A couple key events</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>happen after His night of prayer.  First, Jesus calls twelve
individuals and appoints them as apostles (literally “ones who are sent” or
“people on a mission”). Secondly, after the commissioning of the twelve, Jesus
continues His ministry to those who seek the GOoD News that He preaches, not
only in word but in action.  He demonstrates the compassion and healing that
are the hallmarks of His Abba.  He brings salus (healing, wholeness, salvation)
to those who are in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am once again reminded of
two of GOD’s most enduring qualities – mercy-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassion and love.  It is for that very reason that GOD
allowed (and sent) the Son to come into the world to give a more powerful
example of the love that GOD has for all people.  GOD is more interested in
bringing salus to people than in having people perform rites and be enslaved by
laws and regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that at times I have been insistent on following
rules, not just as guidelines, but for their own sake.  I </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>figured if I kept all the rules, then I would “earn” credits
in my heavenly account.  I also, at times, tried to enforce the laws and
commands on others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over the years, I have come to the realization that there is
no way that I can keep all the laws and rules, even though I should try to keep
them.  I have also been struck by the awareness that GOD does not want robots
who automatically do what they are told without a sense of commitment,
compassion, or gratitude.  GOD wants to have a relationship with me.  GOD has
again and again demonstrated the divine compassion and mercy toward me and
others around me.  The LORD GOD desires that I accept what is being offered to
me and respond in thanksgiving and loving praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To me, that does not mean that rules and regulations are not
important; they are.  They are, however, only to be guidelines that enable me
to check on how I am responding to GOD’s compassion and love.  What is
important is that I reflect on the mercy and love that GOD bestows on me and
respond gratefully and with thankful praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What that means in practical way is that I need to spend
time in prayer, as Jesus did.  It also means that I realize that I am called to
be apostolic also – that I have been commissioned to continue Jesus’ mission of
sharing the GOoD News with others, particularly in the way I treat them with
compassion and care.  The words of the psalmist need to become mine not just so
I rattle them off, but so I can proclaim the words in my behavior:  “Let Your
faithful ones bless You.  Let them discourse of the glory of Your reign and
speak of Your might.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Have I allowed
myself to be misled by people who preach a message that they say is as
important or more important than Gospel that Jesus came to share with us in
word and action?   Do I see adherence to rules and regulations as a means to
earn what GOD has in store for me or do I see my actions as a response to what
GOD has already done for me?  How do I see myself as apostolic – a person on a
divinely inspired mission? How can I bring the GOoD News of GOD’s mercy-
compassion and love to another individual today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all mercy and compassion. 
Through Your GOoDness we have been given a share in Your life, and in the
ministry of Your Son, Jesus.  He continues to call individuals to be apostles –
people on a divine mission.  We who have been baptized and died to our old,
sinful selves, are called to rise to the new life of grace and mercy. 
Regretfully, we have sometimes clung to our old ways rather than embracing the
newness that comes from our being commissioned by Jesus.  Or we have allowed
ourselves to be misled by people who say they know more than what You have
revealed in Your Word.  Through Jesus, You continue to send us forth to
proclaim in word and action Your GOoD News of salus (healing, wholeness, and
salvation).  As we reach out with compassion and love to those around us, You
touch people’s lives and make them new.  We raise our grateful and joyful
praise to You in thanksgiving for all You do for us, especially in and through
Your Son, Jesus.  For He is our Master-Teacher and Brother, our Savior and
Redeemer, Who has died and is risen, and is now living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Colossians 3: 1-11;        Psalm 145: 2-3, 10-11,
12-13ab;          Luke 6: 20-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today present quite a few practical guidelines
for the life of a disciple of Jesus.  St. Paul in his letter to the faithful at
Colossae challenges the believers to throw off the vicious garments (clothing
of vices) and be clothed with the virtuous apparel (clothing of virtues).  The
psalm calls for those whom GOD has blessed to praise GOD’s greatness in the
presence of others.  In the Gospel, Jesus addresses His disciples with Luke’s
version of the Beatitudes that is more practical and physical (and shorter)
than Matthew’s version that is more spiritual and mental.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In writing to the Colossians, St. Paul alludes to the
baptismal rite in which those who are about to be “plunged” (baptizo) into the
waters of salvation, disrobe and put behind them their old clothes. As they
emerge out of the waters of Baptism and the new life that they have received in
Jesus, they don new, white garments that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>symbolize their sharing in the life of the Risen Lord.  Paul
equates the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>old, soiled clothing with the life of vices that they should
have left behind.  They are not to return to wearing those dirty things, but to
always realize the newness they have received in Christ.  In particular Paul
points out the earthly vices that must not be part of their new</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life:  immorality, impurity, passion (lust), evil desires,
greed, anger, fury, malice, slander, obscene language, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lying.  Those are the characteristics of their former,
worldly life.  They are now clothed in Christ and are united with all those who
are one with Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist reminds all those who are part of the Reign of
GOD to act in a way that invites others to be a part of the divine Reign.  That
means they must model the presence of GOD’s reigning in their lives and
proclaim the Lordship of GOD by both word and action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Luke’s Gospel, Jesus descends to the plain to deliver His
sermon (whereas in Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus ascends a hill to proclaim the
Sermon on the Mount).  Both accounts have Jesus beginning His preaching with
the Beatitudes.  Jesus, according to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luke, addresses real economic and social conditions, whereas
in Matthew’s account, Jesus speaks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>about religious and spiritual attitudes.  Both versions have
Jesus proclaiming a reversal of fortunes:  the rich become poor, while the poor
are enriched; those who are filled become wanting, while those who are without
the necessities of life are satisfied beyond expectation; and those who are
experiencing hardship and sorrows are blessed with abundant joy, while those
who are happy and content with their way of life are left in a miserable state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am led to ask myself, “with
which image do I presently identify?”  In some ways I find it hard to throw</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>out the old, stained garments to which I had become
accustomed.  I find it hard to keep the new garment, with which I have been
clothed, free of being marred with filth.  It is so easy to sell out to the
values of the world that include greed, pleasure, wealth, and fame.  I find it
difficult to associate with the poor and outcasts, the sorrowing, and needy.  I
desire to buy into the philosophy that says that I should enjoy the benefits
that I have “earned” by my hard work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, the Lord Jesus is saying to me, “Do you want everything
the world offers you at the cost of losing the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>out-of-this-world blessings I have in store for you?”  I
have been given a choice.  I must choose with what values will I be
associated.  I can be part of the realm of this world, with its deceptive
promises of having great times, power, money, beauty, and happiness.  Or I can
choose to be a proclaimer of the Reign of GOD and the real and eternal
blessings which that Reign promises – joy, peace, and divine love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is only when I fully identify with GOD’s reign and live a
life that promotes its value that I can praise GOD in the way which the LORD
deserves.  It means that I must link myself with the poor, the outcasts, the
sorrowful, and the disenfranchised so that I can be a true member of the Reign
of GOD to come.  It is then that I can proclaim with the psalmist today and
say, “Let me discourse of the glory of Your Reign, and speak of Your might,
making known to others Your might and the glorious splendor of Your Reign.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What are the
vestiges of the worldly ways to which I still cling? How can I be more aware of
the newness that GOD is offering me as I enter the Reign of GOD more fully? 
What hope can I bring to those who are in need of my help?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all blessings.  Through Your
GOoDness we are invited to be a part of Your Reign.  Our ticket into Your Reign
comes from being one with those who are a part of it through their abandoning
the ways of the worldly realm.  You have asked us to discard the old, grimy
garments that mark the people of the world, and to be clothed in the new, clean
vestments of Your Reign.  For the times we have chosen to cling to the ways and
vestiges of the world rather than Your plans, we seek Your pardon and peace. 
Continue to pour out Your Holy Spirit upon us so that we can follow Your Son in
proclaiming Your Reign, in words and in actions.  We make this prayer in the
name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who is
now fully reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever
and ever.  Amen.</p>

Colossians 3: 12-17;        Psalm 150: 1b-2, 3-4, 5-6;         Luke 6: 27-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the readings today, we are given some practical ways to
live our life in gratitude to, and imitation of, GOD. St. Paul gives to the
faithful at Colossae ways in which they can live out their faith.  The psalm is
a reminder that the most important way to respond to GOD’s GOoDness is through
praise of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus calls His disciples to a higher level of
behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from St. Paul’s Letter to the Colossians
continues the imagery that was read yesterday:  putting on new, clean, fresh,
clothing.  There are many different articles of apparel that are needed: 
heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, bearing with
one another, forgiveness, peace, gratitude.  Each of these marks how the
“well-dressed” Christian should look and act.  The outermost garment which
summarizes and covers all the rest of the accouterments is love.  This is what
people should see first and foremost when they look at us.  All of these
virtues deal with how Christians reflects their thankfulness to GOD for the gifts
that GOD has bestowed on them – in and through Jesus.  Our treatment of others
is a testimony to the GOoDness that GOD has bestowed on us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist urges every living creature to use whatever is
available to proclaim praise and to give thanks to GOD for all that the LORD
has done for them.  Every means should be used to express gratitude to GOD. 
Every action that is performed should give witness to GOD’s mighty deeds and
sovereign majesty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus demands that His followers exceed the
prescription of the old covenant, that expected an-eye-for-an-eye treatment of
others. According to the former commandments, it was important to love one’s
family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and neighbors who believed the same things, yet one’s
enemies should be treated with hatred and derision.  Jesus urges His disciples
to imitate the compassion, mercy, and love that GOD had shown towards the
Chosen People.  According</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to Jesus’ directions, we should give without being asked,
provide more than what is demanded of us, forgive without counting the hurt,
love without counting the cost.  For that is exactly how GOD has treated us,
especially as demonstrated in and through the ministry of the Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This pericope (selection from scripture) ends with Jesus
using the imagery of being generous and loving to others so that GOD could give
even more back to us.  The picture is of a merchant who uses a very generous
measuring cup to fill a customer’s vessel with a desired commodity, such as
flour.  If the merchant uses a measuring device that is greater than normal
unit of measurement, then GOD will not only fill the merchant’s vessels with
the same benevolent measuring device, but GOD will pour the desired commodity
into the folds of the merchant’s clothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize there are two
aspects of the readings that are linked together.  The first is GOD’s
graciousness, compassion, and love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD bestows gifts after gifts upon people.  The Lord Jesus
blesses individuals more than they could ever deserve.  In response, GOD only
wants us to acknowledge what we have received.  That leads to the second
aspect.  The best</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way to express our gratitude to, and praise of, GOD is by
extending the same kindness, generosity, and love to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does that mean practically? It demands that we think of
others more than we think of ourselves – that is, we must be willing to give
unconditional love to them.  We need to treat them with more understanding and
compassion than we expect to receive from them.  Jesus remarks in the Gospel
that if the only reason we treat people nicely is that we expect them to return
the favor and treat us nicely, then we are no better than non- believers.  When
we are willing to care for others who are our enemies or people who cannot give
back to us, it is then that we best imitate the love and care GOD has for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In an episode of the series, Answered Prayers on TLC, a
pastor is viciously attacked in his own home by a burglar.  The pastor is
stabbed 37 times and left for dead.  He experiences a NDE (Near Death Experience),
and in which, he is told that “they still need you.”  He recovers from his
bloody experience and forgives his attacker. The episode is called The
Intruder.  This is a great example of extending forgiveness to those who have
hurt us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our relating to others with heartfelt compassion, kindness,
humility, gentleness, patience, forbearance,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness, peace, and gratitude does not reward us with
GOD’s love.  Those GOoD qualities are the outflow of how the Lord Jesus has
already dealt with us.  We only imitate what GOD has done, is doing, and will
continue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to do.  To paraphrase an old idiom, “Imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery,” and this is especially true when it comes to our
grateful praise of GOD.  We are called to be as loving and caring as humanly
(and divinely) possible for us, because the human/divine person, Jesus, – and
His Abba-Father in union with the Holy Spirit – has been loving and caring with
us.  If we can do that then we can echo the sentiments of the psalmist today in
paraphrased words and say, “Let my every breath praise You, LORD!  Alleluia.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Do I only do nice
and kind things when I expect something in return? How do I show my gratitude
to GOD for all that GOD has given me? Am I able to forgive those who have
wronged me, even before they ask for pardon? How much does my attitude reflect
the way GOD has loved and forgiven me? Can people get a glimpse of GOD’s
GOoDness in the way I treat them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all love and compassion. 
Through Your GOoDness we have been blessed beyond what we deserve or could even
imagine.  You have loved us even when we were Your enemies through our
sinfulness.  You have used an even more generous measuring cup with us than we,
at our most generous moments, have used with others.  You continue to
abundantly pour what we need, not only into our vessel (our life), but into the
folds of our very being.  We have not always appreciated and given You thanks
for Your graciousness.  For this we once again seek Your pardon and
forgiveness.  Through the continued outpouring of the Holy Spirit, helps us
imitate the unconditional love that Your Son has shared with us and to which He
calls us.  May we always and everywhere give You praise and thanks, not just in
words, but by our reflecting Your love to those whom we meet, especially those
who cannot or will not be able to respond in kind to us.  We make this prayer
in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Master-Teacher and Savior,
Who reflected</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your love in a perfect way, and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Timothy 1: 1-2, 12-14;       Psalm 16: 1b-2a
and 5, 7-8, 11;        Luke 6: 39-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to deceive oneself.  With GOD’s grace, however,
one can see clearly not only for one’s own benefit, but for the benefit of
others.  St. Paul begins his First Letter to his faithful follower, Timothy, by
admitting that he (Paul) had been misinformed and acted according to that
misinformation in persecuting the early members of the Christian community, but
GOD had helped him to clearly see his sinful ways and had appointed him to
bring the GOoD News of Jesus Christ to others.  The psalm, likewise, proclaims
that GOD shows individuals the path to life, joy, and heavenly delights.  In
the Gospel, Jesus warns His disciples that they must not be self-righteous and
think that they have all the answers and can solve everyone’s problems, since
the self-righteous are blinded to the Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul writes to his “true child in the faith” and
co-worker, St. Timothy.  Paul relates how he had practiced a false vision of
faith, filled with misconceptions.  In his desire to be righteous, he had
persecuted those who were following the Truth (Who is Jesus).  Thanks to the
grace of GOD, Paul was given the opportunity to see the blindness of his ways
as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus Himself appeared to Paul (on the road to Damascus). 
After his period of blindness, Paul not only came to the Truth, but because he
had been such an enemy of the Truth, he has been commissioned to preach the
compassion and forgiveness of GOD to others.  His personal experience of
receiving pardon and peace from Jesus made him a fitting messenger of GOD’s
mercy to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist realizes that only in GOD is there counsel,
truth, and salvation.  If one is willing to follow the ways of the LORD, one
can experience the only right path to life, fullness of joy, and delights at
GOD’s right hand forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus cautions His disciples against having a
superior attitude.  They are disciples</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– disciplined learners, students – of the One and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only Master-Teacher.  They should not have an air of
supremacy or superiority over others.  They are sinful individuals who have
experienced the forgiveness of GOD.  Therefore, they must seek to aid others in
drawing closer to GOD, not to put stumbling blocks in the way of others.  If
they persist in their misguided perceptions, then they are blind individuals
leading other blind people.  They must first correct</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whatever is preventing them from seeing clearly, and then
they will be able to be more effective in their aiding others who have minor
“vision” problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize how common it is for
people to have vision problems, and I don’t mean myopia or other ocular
problems.  At many times in our lives, we fail to see what GOD would have us
see.  St. Paul was very much that way in his energetic persecution of those
whom he believed were misguided.  In fact, it was Paul who was not seeing with
the eyes of GOD, but only with his own self-righteous eyes.  Paul had to be
struck blind so that he could see the vision that GOD wanted him to see.  After
his sight was restored (both physically and spiritually), he was able to see
the divine vision (plan) better.  This was a source of salvation not </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>only for himself but for all those to whom he would
minister.  He would be a fitting witness to GOD’s GOoD News of forgiveness,
love, and healing, since he had been blind and now he sees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vision is so important, not only for ourselves, but for
others.  If we have sight, we can drive a car, do certain kinds of work.  If we
are driving, for example, and all of the sudden we lose sight, we endanger not
only ourselves but those around us.  If we insist that we can see when we
can’t, it can cause all sorts of problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A GOoD question to ask ourselves is:  “What is impeding my
vision of GOD’s plan for myself and for others?”  Obviously, sin is the biggest
block to seeing the divine plan.  Self-righteousness is another hindrance to
seeing clearly.  Riches can put blinders on our vision of what GOD would have
us see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants us to have better than 20-20 vision.  GOD wants us
to be so aware of the plan of salvation that we can enjoy the life, the joy,
and the delights of GOD’s hand.  The more we realize how blind we have been,
the more GOD can use us in restoring the divine vision not only for ourselves
but also for others.  The first step, as the Gospel states, is to realize what
is preventing us from seeing the sights that GOD wants us to see.  Jesus, the
Master-Teacher and Healer, is waiting for us to admit our vision problems.  He
wants to heal us and teach us, so we can go out and continue His ministry.  We
need to invite Jesus more fully into our sights and admit what the psalmist
today says, “You, LORD, will show me the path to life, fullness of joys in Your
presence, the delights at Your right hand forever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What has been an
experience in my life when I didn’t see clearly (either physically or
spiritually)? Did I pretend that my vision was fine, even though it wasn’t?
What enabled me to see more clearly? What does this have to say about my
spiritual journey today? How can I improve my spiritual vision even more? What
can I do to help enlighten others and help them to see more clearly?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of all vision.  Through Your
GOoDness, You lead us out of darkness into Your Light.  You are willing to heal
all of our blindness so that we can see Your plan more clearly.  At times we
have been mistaken in our ability to see clearly because we have failed to
admit that there were things blocking our sight.  For the times we have chosen
only limited vision rather than the fullness of sight that You have promised,
we seek Your forgiveness and healing.  We thank You for sending us Your most
precious vision in and through Your Son, Jesus.  He has come to be the Light,
the Truth, the Way, and the Life for us.  Continue to empower us with the gifts
of Your Holy Spirit so that we can have insight, right judgment, wisdom, and
understanding, not only for our own sake, but also the for the sake of those
whom You call us to serve.  We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who is Your Vision for our lives, and
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Timothy 1: 15-17;             Psalm 113: 1b-2,
3-4, 5 and 6-7;                  Luke 6: 43-49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people may think that the readings disagree with each
other. St. Paul describes how he was the foremost of sinners because of his
persecution of the followers of Jesus, yet now he has changed 180° from that
direction and he is able to be one of the strongest proclaimers of the GOoD
News of Jesus.  In the Gospel, in an apparent contrast,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus remarks that a bad tree cannot bear GOoD fruit, nor a
GOoD tree bear bad fruit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul once again shares with Timothy how he has turned
from one of the most ardent opponents of message of Jesus (that He came to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>bring salvation to all) to one of the most dramatic proponents
of a relationship with Jesus and His followers, that is open to all who will
hear the GOoD News.  Paul’s remarks just go to prove how merciful the Lord
Jesus is.  He also praises GOD because he – Paul – can be a GOoD example of how
GOD can change a person’s heart and bring new life to the most wayward of
sinners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD.  It urges
constant worship and honor of GOD, especially because GOD can do the impossible
by raising the poor and lowly, (and forgiving the most vicious [full of vice]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of sinners).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus begins today’s Gospel by saying that a GOoD tree
cannot bear bad fruit, nor a bad tree bear GOoD fruit.  Another saying of Jesus
echoes this passage:  “By their fruit you will know them”  (Matthew 7: 16-20). 
Jesus expands this idea today in saying that a true disciple must do more than
just cry out “Lord, Lord.”  Words are not enough.  One’s actions must reflect
what one believes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some may wonder if Paul was a bad tree that bore GOoD fruit
in contradiction to today’s Gospel.  In my reflecting, I am coming to the
conclusion that a bad tree could become a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD tree, not of its own choice but by GOD’s intervening
and extending forgiveness and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mercy.  Then the former bad tree can bear GOoD fruit because
it is no longer a bad tree.  When I think about what Jesus is saying in today’s
Gospel, I realize He is speaking of the relationship between a person’s words
and her/his behavior.  One ultimately acts in a way that is consistent with
one’s beliefs and orientation.  If people are in relationship with GOD, they
will generally act as individuals who know they have been loved, forgiven, and
empowered by GOD, as Paul did after his conversion.  I am not saying that a
person who is oriented toward GOD (ad Deum) does not sometime slip and commit
sin.  All of us are still in the process of growing into the holiness that GOD
shares with us and to which GOD calls us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more we are aware, as Paul was, of how gracious (full of
grace) the Lord Jesus is and how GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reached out to us with the salus (healing, wholeness,
salvation, forgiveness), the more we will want to have our lives reflect how
GOD has dealt compassionately and lovingly with us.  That is why Paul became
such a strong </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>witness to the GOoD News that was announced and brought to
the world by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no way we can ever give fitting thanks to GOD for
the graciousness that has been extended to us.  We can, however, do what the
psalmist suggests today:  give constant praise and glory to GOD (from the
rising of the sun to its setting – that is all day).  And one of the greatest
ways we can praise GOD is to walk as the adopted children we have become.  We
should praise GOD by being constant witnesses of GOD’s GOoDness.  Our very
lives should bear the GOoD fruit because GOD has changed us from bad trees to
GOoD trees.  We have been empowered by GOD’s mercy, love, and tenderness to
change from our former way of life (being bad trees that were against GOD [a
theos]) to being able to be GOoD trees that are oriented toward GOD (ad Deum). 
Our lives should truly reflect our new orientation, that has come to us, in and
through Jesus.  Let us praise GOD as the psalmist suggests, for (in a
paraphrase of the last verse of the Responsorial Psalm) “the LORD has raised
us, the lowly, from the dust; from the dunghill GOD has lifted up all of us who
were poor and sinful.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What sort of fruit
am I bearing?  Can people experience the GOoD fruit that GOD allows me to grow
because GOD has made me a GOoD tree?  How have I experienced the love,
compassion, and mercy of GOD that transforms me from a formerly bad tree into a
GOoD tree?  How can I extend that GOoD fruit to a particular individual today?
This weekend?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all love and mercy.  Through
Your GOoDness we have been transformed from bad trees bearing bad fruit, to
Your GOoD trees with the capability of bearing GOoD fruit that reflects Your
GOoDness.  Through Your Son, Jesus, You have lifted us from the dust and
dunghill and allowed us to be not only Your children (sisters and brothers of
Jesus), but also His co-workers and witnesses to the GOoD News of salvation
which He brought to the world.  For the times we have failed to bear GOoD
fruit, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to strengthen us through
Your Holy Spirit.  We give all praise, glory, honor, and love to You from our
rising in the morning to our resting at night, for You continue to raise us
up.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our
Master-Teacher and Savior, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/exaltation-of-the-holy-cross</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Numbers 21: 4b-9;        Psalm 78: 1bc-2, 34-35,
36-37, 38;        Philippians 2: 6-11;         John 3: 13-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s feast takes precedence over the normal succession of
readings (Thursday of the Twenty-third Week in Ordinary Time).  This is the
Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross of Jesus.  It is celebrated this day
for this is the day that the basilica of the Holy Sepulcher was dedicated in
Jerusalem over the site where many believed Jesus died on the cross.  At this
site, crosses were found, one of which may have been the cross on which Jesus
died.  Today is also the celebration of the return of the Holy Cross to
Jerusalem after it had been taken by the Persians.  This feast is sometimes
called the Triumph of the Cross, but I like the connotation that is linked to
the word “exaltation.” Note it is not the “exultation” but “exaltation.”
Exaltation means “an elevation or lifting up, particularly to a place of honor
and glory.” The cross was lifted up with Jesus on it and it became the means of
Jesus’ being honored and our being lifted up to glory of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings allow us to reflect on the meaning of the cross
in the plan of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation and Jesus’ being raised up and, consequently, our
being raised up eventually to be with Jesus in heaven.  The First Reading is
seen as a pre-figurement of the crucifixion of Jesus.  Moses lifts up the
likeness of a seraph serpent mounted on a pole.  This brings salus (healing,
salvation) to those who had been bitten by seraph serpents as punishment for
the people’s sins of complaining against GOD and Moses. The psalm reminds us
not to forget the works of the LORD GOD.  In the Second Reading, in one of the
most powerful summaries of the life of Jesus, St. Paul reminds</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us to what extent Jesus went in order to bring us salus
(salvation).  The Gospel today alludes back to the serpent on the pole and how
it is a sign pointing to the even greater salus that GOD brings to all who look
upon the One Who is lifted up on the wood of the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our First Reading, as the Israelites are journeying in
the desert, they begin to complain about the poor conditions in which they are
existing.  They are tired of eating the manna (the “bread from heaven”) that
GOD has provided for them. GOD allows the seraph (“fiery”) serpents to bite and
inflict pain on the people who were forgetful of the great deeds of GOD in the
Exodus events.  When the people realize their own sinfulness in their not being
grateful for what GOD had</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>done, they ask for healing.  GOD commands Moses to make a
bronze image of the serpent and to mount it on a wooden pole and to lift up the
image.  [The image of a serpent on a pole is one of the universal symbols for
medical help.  This imagery, that is used by medical corporations and agencies,
is said to be taken partly from this passage in Numbers.]  All who look at the
raised</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>up (exalted) image on the wood with the serpent are given
healing (salus) and are raised up from their sickness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial psalm is a call to remember GOD’s
GOoDness.  When attention is turned selfishly toward oneself, it is easy to
forget about GOD’s loving protection and all the GOoD things GOD has done. 
Looking back over the past history, one can see how the LORD’s mercy and
forgiveness have been more powerful than GOD’s wrath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul may be using an early
Christian profession of faith and/or hymn in his letter to the Philippians. 
This often-quoted passage gives a GOoD overview of the ministry of Jesus. 
Jesus, as the ever-existing Son of GOD, was equal to His Abba-Father. It would
have been easy for Jesus to hold onto His position as one with His Abba and the
Holy Spirit.  Yet, the Son of GOD was willing to do whatever was necessary so
that people could know the love of GOD. Thus, Jesus put aside His almighty,
all-powerful divine nature and humbly limited Himself to the lower nature of
being human. Not only did He become human, but he took on the role of a servant
– one who waits on others and takes care of their needs.  This was not the full
extent of His humbling Himself (His êÝíïóéò –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>kenosis – emptying of Himself) and His lowering of Himself.
Jesus went even further, experiencing human death.  And it was not just any
death, but the most painful (excruciating - ex = from, crucis = cross), most
humiliating death possible</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>at the time – crucifixion. Yet in doing so, He manifested
His obedience to the will of His Abba.  Thus, GOD raised up (exalted) Jesus and
bestowed the greatest of honored titles on Jesus – that of being the LORD –
Adonai – one with YHWH (GOD).  And if GOD has raised (exalted) Jesus to this
position (which He had before His incarnation), we too must exalt the name of
Jesus – give glory and honor to Jesus and His Abba in the union with the Holy
Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of today’s Gospel is often seen, and quoted, as the
essential one-liner of the Christian faith: “GOD so loved the world </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that GOD gave the only begotten Son (to the world), so that
the ones who believe in Jesus might not perish, but might have eternal life.” 
The rest of today’s passage rounds out this GOoD News: Jesus, like the seraph
serpent on the pole in our First Reading, is lifted up (exalted) on the wood.
This being lifted up (exaltation) on the wood brings salus (wholeness, healing,
and salvation) to all who look upon Him.  GOD allowed His Son to be put to
death by being lifted up (exalted) on the wood of the cross, not to condemn the
world but that world might experience the salus of GOD and be exalted to
sharing in divine life. And thus, after His salvific death, Jesus is raised up
(exalted) in the victorious resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the Holy Cross (Santa Cruz), I am somewhat
taken aback by this most holy symbol of our salvation.  We are called to carry
our cross.  But that does not mean wearing a golden, jewel-embedded cross. 
Wearing a beautifully decorated cross may be a reminder to some of their faith,
but it may also be just a nice piece of jewelry.  Yes, it is important to have
this most powerful sign in front of us at all times, but we need to realize
what the cross was to Jesus.  It meant</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>death.  It meant excruciating pain.  It meant humiliation. 
And because of this, Christians did not start using the cross as a symbol of
their faith until about the fifth century.  The cross meant being despised and
rejected.  Yet for Jesus it also meant obedience to His Abba and a means of
bringing salus to those whom He came to serve and save.  It meant glorification
(exaltation) of His Abba’s plan and the lifting up (exaltation) of those who
would see His being lifted up (exalted) on both the cross and in the
resurrection as part of GOD’s GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Crucifixion was revised by the Romans as one of the most
painful and humiliating forms of execution at that time.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>was seen as the opposite of exaltation and honor.  It was
not allowed to be used in the execution of a Roman citizen, because they were
too honorable to be subjected to such a ignominious and degrading death. 
According to some scholars, the condemned individual was humiliatingly stripped
of all clothing, fixed to the cross beam (by being tied and/or nailed), and
lifted up (exalted) onto the upright section.  The feet were then attached to
the upright wood.  This death was truly excruciating beyond all comprehension.
The word “excruciating” literally means “from the cross – ex cruce.”  Some
crucified people would hang on the cross for days before finally dying.  Death
came slowly and painfully. According to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>some medical experts, the actual cause of death was not loss
of blood, but affixation. As the body of the crucified dropped from its own
sheer weight, the dying person could not breathe.  The only relief for the one
on the cross was when the condemned pushed up from the feet fixed below,
allowing a breath to be taken once again.  Eventually one could not relieve the
pain in the chest any longer and died.  To speed the death, the crucified
person often had their legs broken so one could not push up and take a fresh
breath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the cross and the Crucified One, I begin to
realize that Jesus chose this time in history to come and announce the love of
His Abba.  This particular time in history was chosen in order that Jesus could
die on the cross in order that we might be saved by the “excruciating” death of
One Who had given up His place in heaven and emptied (kenosis) Himself in order
to share in our humanity to its fullest.  His exaltation in glory came from his
exaltation on the painful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>means of death on the cross.  We have received salus and
exaltation from the One Who was lifted up on the wood of the cross.  Let us
continue to lift up glory and praise (exaltation) to GOD and to the One Who has
been lifted up and exalted both on the cross and in the resurrection. Let us
confess with our tongue that Jesus Christ is LORD, to the glory of GOD His
Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What images come to
my mind when I think of the cross of Jesus? How can I lift up the cross of the
Lord Jesus as a sign of my belief in the salvation that He brought through His
death and resurrection? In what way can I carry my cross as a sign of my
wanting to be united with my exalted Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all glory.  Desirous of our
knowing Your love, You have allowed Your Son, equal to You in all things, to
forego His rightful and exalted place in Your Heavenly Realm.  He willingly
humbled and emptied Himself to share in our humanity so that we might
understand Your love as spoken by One Who was like us in everything but sin. 
He demonstrated His complete union with all humanity by being willing to die. 
Not only did He agree to die, but He gave His life in the most profound, and
excruciating way – dying on an uplifted (exalted) cross.  We seek Your
forgiveness for the times we have complained about our life, forgetting about
what You have done for us, especially in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and through the life, ministry, crucifixion, death, and
resurrection of Your Son, Jesus.  May we continue to praise You and give You
glory as we proclaim Jesus as our Master, our Teacher, our Savior, our Exalted
Lord, Who is one with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever
and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of Our Lady of Sorrows</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Lady of Sorrows:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/our-lady-of-sorrows</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   1 Timothy 2: 1-8;      Psalm 28: 2, 7,8-9;      
John 19: 25-27  or  Luke 2: 33-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading and Responsorial are part of the cycle
of readings for Ordinary Time.  The Gospel is chosen for the Memorial of Our
Lady of Sorrows.  In the First Reading St. Paul urges Timothy and the community
he serves to lift up prayers not only for themselves and fellow believers, but
for all people.  The Responsorial is a prayer asking GOD to listen and be
attentive to the needs of those who pray.  As we celebrate the Memorial of Our
Lady of Sorrows, in the choice of the two Gospel readings we have, we see how
Mary suffered because of relationship with her Son, Jesus, but how she was
willing to bear the pain and agony of having her heart pierced in order to
bring more people to the love of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There seems to be some concern that in the faith community
at Ephesus, where St. Timothy was shepherding the flock, that they only had to
pray for their fellow believers.  St. Paul urges Timothy to be sure to lead the
assembled believers in prayers for everyone, including non- believers and
particularly for those in authority – in both civil and religious.  Paul
reminds them that GOD wills that all people be saved, and that Jesus has come
as the one and only mediator between</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humankind and GOD.  Jesus did not come just to save those who
quickly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>embraced the gifts of faith or those who were already
“faithful,” but for everyone.  When the faithful gather to pray, they are urged
not to let resentment or bitterness prevent them from praying for those with
whom they disagreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist beseeches GOD to hear his prayer.  The later
verses of today’s selection demonstrate the trust that those who pray should
have in the GOD Who is their strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the optional sequence (Stabat Mater), we are reminded
that Mary stood at</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the foot of the cross, compassionately suffering with her
Son.  In the sequence, we pray that we might be touched in a similar way as we
reflect on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>suffering and death of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On this day of the Memorial of Our Lady</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Sorrows, on the day after the Exaltation of the Holy
Cross, we have a choice of two Gospels.  In the Gospel from St. John, as Jesus
hangs on His cross, suffering and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dying, He is aware of the presence of His mother and the
beloved disciple. Jesus entrusts the care of His mother to His disciple, and
the care of His disciple to His mother.  Part of the salvific plan is that we
are responsible for the continued care of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the other Gospel option (Luke 2: 33-35), Mary is told
that her Son will both be a source of blessings and salvation, but also a source
of having to suffer.  It is also revealed to her that she will have her soul
pierced by pain as she travels along the Way of Life with her Son, Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s love is beyond all telling.  Yet, since GOD in human
flesh limited</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His time on earth to thirty-something years, the need for
human-to-human</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>caring was entrusted to His disciples and loved ones.  This
concern for others includes being willing to pray for one another and serve
each other.  GOD has willed that human-to-human touch be continued by those who
invoke the name of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, there are many ways that we share in the caring
ministry of Jesus.  It can include loving those </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whom GOD has entrusted to our care (as Jesus entrusted His
mother into the care of His beloved disciple, and him into her care).  Today’s
Memorial of Our Lady of Sorrows reminds us that caring for others may manifest
itself by being compassionate and suffering with others even when we cannot do
anything else except be there while another is going through pain and agony. 
Our presence with the hurting individual shows our willingness to bring GOD’s
presence to the pained person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At other times, we may be called to reach out and get
involved in other people’s lives by helping them in some sort of physical way,
for example as Mother Teresa washed the wounds of those who were suffering from
leprosy or other maladies.  It could also include donating some of our treasure
to those who are less fortunate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One other way that the disciples of Jesus carry on His
ministry is through intercessory prayer.  We show our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>concern for others by our praying for them and with them. 
This apostolic ministry may be the only type of ministry we can show to certain
individuals at this point in our lives due to our own limited capacities or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because those for whom we pray do not want us to be involved
in their lives.  Prayer is a very powerful tool we have as fellow servants of
the Word of GOD.  We can show our desire that all people will know the gift of
salus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(healing, well-being, salvation) as GOD intends even if we
are at odds with those for whom we pray, or we are not able to be with the
physically.  Sometimes just saying, “GOD, I don’t know what You want for this
person,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but I lift them up to You.”  This shows that we love them
with the unconditional love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know I spend a lot of time praying for others.  I have
been praying for certain people by name for over</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>twenty years, even though I have not heard from them or
about them at all during that time.  At other times, a person’s name pops to mind
while I am in intercessory prayer.  While I pray for others, I am linked with
them through the love that flows from GOD and from Jesus Who died on the
cross.  I usually end my intercessory prayers with words something similar to
these:  “I pray for all those who have asked me to pray, and I pray for those
whom I have promised to pray.  I pray for those most in need of my being united
with them in prayer.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In praying for others, we are truly being disciples of the
Lord.  We are showing our acceptance of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>responsibility to be concerned for the salus of others,
especially those for whom GOD has entrusted us to care. We lift up and are
lifted up by our intercessory prayer and we re-affirm our belief, as the
psalmist says today, that “the Lord is my strength and my shield.  In GOD my
heart trusts, and I find help; then my heart exults, and with my song I give
the LORD thanks.  The LORD is the strength of all GOD’s people, the saving
refuge of GOD’s anointed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I view those
who are different than me or who hold a different perspective of worshiping the
LORD GOD or who do not belong to a faith community? Do I do all I can to work,
and pray, for the unity of all believers and the welcoming of non-believers
into the flock of the Lord Jesus? Do I submit to the complete authority of the
Lord Jesus with the confidence that GOD can and does work in mysterious, yet
wonderful ways? When I reflect on Mary as our Sorrowful Mother, what thoughts
and feelings do I have?  What can I do to make others aware of the true vision
of the loving compassion of GOD, especially for those who are most in need of
the gift of spiritual insight and forgiveness which comes from Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all peoples.  Through Your GOoDness,
You have sent Your Son, Jesus, as the Savior of the whole world. His death on
the cross (and His resurrection) was the means by which salus is available to
all. According to Your divine plan, Your Son entrusted the care of others to
His disciples. At times we have failed to care for those whom You have
entrusted to our care because we were out of sorts or upset. Please extend Your
forgiveness to us for those times. Through the working of the Holy Spirit in
our lives, help us to minister to others, especially to those who need us to
share Your loving concern.  Make us aware of those whom we should serve in
action and through prayer. We lift up this prayer to You, our Strength, in the
name of Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Brother, Who continues His ministry
through us and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

2cd-3ab, 5, 6;         Luke 7: 11-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today present particular aspects of what
ministry is all about.  In the First Reading, St. Paul gives advice to his
protégé and colleague (Timothy) about how to choose and recognize those who are
to be the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>servant-leaders within the community at Ephesus.  The psalm
calls those who live lives of integrity (wholeness and holiness), to be
blameless, since they are the chosen of GOD and to be in the service of the
LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus gives an example of what true leadership is all
about in His compassionate raising of the dead son of a widow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Letter from St. Paul to Timothy seems to be setting
guidelines for those who take on certain functions within the Church.  Three
separate offices are addressed in this passage:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1) the episcopos – “bishop” or “overseer”; 2) the male
diakonoi – “deacons,” “servants,” or “ministers”; 3) the gynaikas – “women.” 
Certain similarities exist for qualities of the three types of ministries. 
They all must be dedicated, known for their living out the Christian faith, for
practicing moderation in all behavior, and for being loving family persons (if
they are already married).  The episcopos should also be able to teach and
administer, not only his family but the whole communities.  It seems that the person
who is able to have a strong and wholesome family life is to be considered a
GOoD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>candidate for an office in the community.  Many scholars
believe that the gynaikas – “women” – were woman deacons who had some sort of
ministerial position in the early church, especially in all female gatherings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm parallels the First Reading in speaking about what
makes a person</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“blameless” and able to “walk with integrity”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in GOD’s “service.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus restores life to the only son of a widowed
woman.  It is because Jesus is moved with compassion that He performs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this miracle.  The widow, without a son, would be considered
a social outcast.  Jesus sees not only her present sorrow at the death of her
son, but the fact that she would be held in low esteem by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me the most in the readings is the concept of
ministry – service.  Jesus performs ministry not to make people think more of
Him or to show His power.  He sees a woman suffering the loss of her only loved
one, who was also her only means of support.  Jesus feels her pain –
(“compassion” literally means “to suffer with another”).  He does not think of
Himself or how He will look better in other people’s eyes.  He wants to be of
service to the woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul informs Timothy that those who aspire to be leaders
in the faith community must show a similar interest in the concerns of those
whom they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lead.  They must be individuals who know the value of true
authority – caring for those who are under their protection.  If an individual
has already manifested the gifts of loving and compassion service to one’s
family, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>then that individual should be considered as a viable
candidate for taking care of the family of believers, the members of the local
believing community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What also is important to me is the concept that official
ministry is not limited to unmarried males.  Women have a position of ministry
within the faith community, and it is not limited to the role of being the
chief cooks and bottle washers.  They are called to recognized service of the
whole community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have always been touched by the way the early Church
called individuals to ministry.  Those who already exhibited a sense of service
to others (their families, particularly) were chosen to be officially “ordained”
– given an order or rank – within the faith community.  Those who were already
performing “ministry” were recognized as servant-leaders of the whole
community, because they acted with the compassion of Jesus.  It seems different
from the way ministers-leaders are chosen for Church ministry today.  They are
“educated” and then “ordained”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and it is hoped that they will somehow be graced to do the
right thing after they are raised to a particular function within the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind me that we must continue to look to GOD
to call forth, and raise up, true servant-leaders who manifest the compassion
of Jesus to the world.  It also means that the faith community must recognize
those who are living lives dedicated to the service of others and give them the
authority to be recognized ministers (servants).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist reminds us today that GOD’s eyes are on the
faithful of land and GOD is saying today as much as GOD said at the time of the
psalmist:  “Those who walks in the way of integrity shall be in My service.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my
understanding of ministry within the faith community? Who has touched my life
with compassionate service? Do I consider myself called to ministry (service)
within the faith community to which I belong? How can I be more compassionate
in dealing with the individuals who come my way today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all compassion.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continue to call individuals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to carry on the work of Your Son in service and ministry of
Your people.  By virtue of our baptism, all of us have the responsibility to be
of service to others.  Yet, sometimes we have failed to live up to the
responsibility You have bestowed upon us.  For our not being true servants and
ministers of Your GOoD News, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  We also ask
that You lift up individuals who will be recognized by the community</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of believers as true servant-leaders and disciples of Your
Son because of their compassionate caring for others. To You be all glory,
honor, and praise for what You are doing in our faith community.  We make this
prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, the ultimate example of loving and
compassionate service of others.  He is our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

Saint Robert Bellarmine:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-robert-bellarmine/ Readings:  1 Timothy
3: 14-16;             Psalm 111: 1-2, 3-4, 5-6;                 Luke 7: 31-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vindication!  A form of this word appears in both the First
Reading and the Gospel.  St. Paul in his letter to Timothy seems to be quoting
an early Christian poem that says that Jesus was “vindicated” in the Spirit. 
The Gospel portrays Jesus addressing the complaints against both Himself and
John the Baptist.  He ends His response by saying, “Wisdom is vindicated by all
her children.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The selection from St. Paul’s letter to Timothy urges the
young leader of the faith community in Ephesus to remain faithful even if Paul
does not get to Ephesus as quickly as he plans.  Using a poetic style similar
to a Hebrew poem, Paul presents the summary of the mystery of Jesus.  The
poetic form uses three groups of two lines.  The first two lines are in
contrast (flesh-Spirit); the second two lines are complementary (seen-
proclaimed).  The final two lines are once again contrasting (world-glory).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is vindicated in Spirit.  The Greek word which is
translated as “vindicated” is from the verb dikaiósei (participle – ἐδικαιώθη),
which a Greek dictionary defines as “put into right relationship (with GOD);
acquit, declare and treat as righteous.”  After Jesus’ ultimate manifestation
in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>flesh – His death and resurrection – He is declared as
righteous and in the most right relationship with His Abba- Father.  GOD
restores the correct order in raising the Son to the fulness of glory and life
that is rightfully His.  The cross and resurrection is not only Jesus’
vindication, but also it is the source of our vindication – the means by which
we are put into right relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm proclaims the greatness of GOD’s
works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It goes on to say that GOD has made known (revealed,
manifested) the power through the divine works.  It is in GOD’s
self-revelation, which reaches its climax in Jesus, that GOD allows us to be
vindicated – put into right relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus compares the opposition He faces to
children who are always complaining about how things are.  The children refuse</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to rejoice and dance when they are played joyful music on a
flute.  The same children also resist being mournful when they hear a sad
funeral hymn.  The people are similar in that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they complain that John the Baptist was so out of his mind
that he seemed possessed because he practiced a strict form of asceticism. In a
similarly negative way, they talk against Jesus because He is always attending
feasts and never seems to fast.  Jesus ends the pericope by saying those who
are children of Wisdom will declare</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus (and John the Baptist) as truly righteous (vindicated
– past, passive tense of dikaiósei – ἐδικαιώθη), for GOD’s Wisdom reveals the
GOoD News as manifest in the life, ministry, death of Jesus (and John the
Baptist), and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is vindication? It is being in the right relationship
with GOD.  The same verb (dikaiósei) is used in Luke 7: 29 which declares that
those who followed the preaching of John the Baptist would “acknowledge the
righteousness of GOD.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To me, this means that if we seek to be in the Spirit and be
one with the will of GOD, we will be vindicated. It signifies we will be in
right relationship with GOD and all our sinfulness will be acquitted. 
Vindication is not due to our actions or deeds or desires.  Vindication is the
action or work of GOD.  Our part is being willing to be the recipients of GOD’s
graciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once we are vindicated by GOD, we are in right relationship
with GOD and our very being (our words and actions) will reflect that we have
been vindicated.  We can be declared righteous (vindicated) not because of our
actions, but because of majestic deeds of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our response to GOD’s vindicating and making us righteous is
to sing GOD’s praise and proclaim the great works of GOD, as the psalmist does
in the Responsorial today.  “Great are the works of the LORD, exquisite in all
their delights. . .[The LORD] has made known to GOD’s people the power of the
divine works, giving them the inheritance of the nations.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What comes to my
mind when I think of vindication? Do I seek to be self-vindicated by performing
certain actions? Or do I realize that I am made right with GOD, not by my
actions or words, but by the gracious works of the Lord Jesus? How do I
manifest my vindication (relationship with GOD)? Do I live out the fact that
GOD has declared me righteous through the death and resurrection of the Lord
Jesus?  Do I lift up a prayer of praise to GOD for all the GOoD that the Lord
Jesus has done for me? Can people experience the righteousness of GOD by my living
it out?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all vindication.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have made us righteous in and through Your Son, Jesus.  He came
to reveal Your desire that we be in right relationship with You.  We have
sometimes chosen to be like the people about whom Jesus spoke in today’s
Gospel.  We complain that You and Your Son have not always acted the way we
have expected You to act.  For our failing to see Your self- revelation,
especially through Your Son, we beg Your forgiveness.  Continue to vindicate us
(make us righteous and in right relationship with You) through Your mercy and
love.  Make us one in Spirit with Your Son, the vindicated vindicator.  We lift
up this prayer of praise and honor to You in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Brother, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-joseph-of-cupertino</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Timothy 4: 12-16;        Psalm 111: 7-8, 9,
10;          Luke 7: 36-50</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When GOD touches people’s lives, they are changed. 
Sometimes the Lord Jesus uses other individuals to touch people’s life, such as
in the case of St. Timothy in the First Reading.  After being a traveling
companion of St. Paul, he is established and installed as overseer (episcopos -
bishop) and leader of the faith community in Ephesus.  The Responsorial Psalm
remarks about the great deeds of the LORD that lead to prudent living and
praise of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus remarks that the realization of GOD’s
loving mercy motivates individuals to greater love because they realize that
they have been touched by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul reminds St. Timothy that the
rest of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>community should not put Timothy down for his young age.  He
has been called by GOD to serve the Ephesians as their leader.  With that call
comes blessings and responsibilities.  Timothy is to continue being a teacher
of faith, both by his example of Christian virtue and his preaching.  That
ministry and mission was conferred on Timothy by the imposition of hands (a
Jewish ritual of imparting power and authority that the Church still uses). 
Timothy’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>attention to his own growth in the Lord Jesus and that of
the people will lead to a fuller realization of the gift of salvation for both
Timothy and the people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whom he serves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist praise GOD for the faithful way that GOD deals
with the Chosen People.  GOD’s steadfastness and honest keeping of the divine
promises are just further signs of the magnificence of GOD.  As the people
realize how awesome GOD is, they should praise and thank GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is invited to the home of Simon, a
Pharisee.  It seems that the Pharisee is more interested in impressing others
by his having Jesus as a guest than in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>seeking to have a relationship with Jesus.  The Pharisee
fails to perform the usual gestures of hospitality:  welcoming his guest with a
kiss,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>washing the feet of guest, and anointing the guest with
oil.  In contrast, a woman, known for her sinful ways, enters the home and lavishly
treats Jesus in a way that is above and beyond mere hospitality.  The Pharisee,
self-righteous as he is, is horrified that Jesus would let such a public sinner
touch Him.  Jesus remarks that love flows from the realization of GOD’s gifts. 
Because the woman has experienced the forgiveness that Jesus makes available to
all sinners, she is able to gratefully express her love toward Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings I am reminded once again that
GOD is the initiator of action.  GOD gives the gifts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– forgiveness, salus (healing, wholeness, salvation), and
faith – to name just a few.  GOD is willing to give those gifts to all who will
accept them.  Some people, like the Pharisee, are not open to GOD’s
graciousness because they see themselves as not needing to be forgiven, healed,
or lacking in faith.  Because they believe they are righteous by their own
actions, they are not open to flow of blessings that come from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others, such as the formerly sinful woman, realize how they
have been gifted by GOD.  They experience the freedom of having their sins
forgiven, the specialness of being loved by GOD, not for their behavior, but in
spite of their behavior.  Because they realize how far GOD has gone to bring
them salus – sending the Son to suffer, die, and rise in order save and redeem
– they are able to be grateful to GOD for all the ways GOD has touched their
lives.  Their actions and behavior flow out of their experience of the GOD’s
blessing of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes people misunderstand this passage and see that the
woman is forgiven because of her love.  That </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would make the woman the initiator, not GOD.  The emphasis
in today’s passage (as can be seen in the parable of the creditor who first
forgives the two indebted individuals) is that GOD is the initiator.  The
action by those who are graced is in response to GOD’s deeds.  It is also the
message in the letter from Paul to Timothy.  GOD is the one who has called
Timothy and chosen him to be the bishop in Ephesus.  Since GOD has chosen
Timothy, Timothy must perform the ministry to which he has been called and
people must respect him as the minister who has been appointed by GOD to be the
leader in the community, even if he is still young.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am once again humbled.  This message of today’s readings
is that GOD does not forgive me and love me because of my deeds, but that I
should want to do GOoD deeds to manifest my thankfulness for what GOD has
already done, and will continue to do, for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Practically, that means that I care and love others so that
they will come to a better awareness of how much GOD loves them.  They are
loveable not because of their own behavior.  They are loved by GOD because GOD
has chosen to take a liking to them.  My loving them is because I see them as
being loveable in GOD’s eyes, and I should love whomever GOD loves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As disciples of Jesus, it is important that we realize how
awesomely GOD reaches out to us.  That should lead to our loving praise of GOD
and our caring for others who are also loved by GOD.  The psalmist today
summarizes this in the following words:  “[The LORD] has sent deliverance to
the people of GOD; GOD has ratified the divine covenant forever; holy and
awesome is GOD’s name. . . GOD’s praise endures forever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: In what ways has GOD
touched my life? How have I responded to GOD’s gracious action? When I
contemplate GOD’s movement in my life – not because I deserve it – but because
GOD has chosen to do so, in spite of my unworthiness – how do I feel?  Toward
whom can I show a similar loving attitude, not because they are loveable in and
of themselves, but because GOD loves them? What can I do to help them realize
how much they are loved by GOD (and therefore also by me)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all graciousness.  Through Your
GOoDness You pour out Your love and forgiveness on the world that does not
deserve Your gifts.  Your initiative of caring for us once again manifests Your
greatness.  At times we have focused on our own self-righteousness and have
blocked Your graces from flowing to us.  We once again admit our need for, and
desire to have, Your pardon and love.  We thank You for all Your mighty and
awesome deeds, but most especially the sending of Your Son, Jesus, Who
manifested Your love and forgiveness in His preaching and His actions.  Through
the presence of Your Holy Spirit in our lives, make us more aware of Your
movement in our lives.  May we respond, as did the sinful woman in today’s
Gospel, by lavishly responding in loving service of those whom You love.  We
lift this prayer of praise and gratitude to You, in the name of Your Son,
Jesus, our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who has died for our sins, and is risen
and living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Timothy 6: 2c-12;         Psalm 49: 6-7, 8-10,
17-18, 19-20;         Luke 8: 1-3</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings challenge us to take discipleship seriously. 
St. Paul urges St. Timothy to be faithful to the teachings that have been given
to him and not to be overcome with a desire for riches.  The psalm also urges
caution in becoming too attached to worldly wealth and possessions.  In the
Gospel, we hear about those who were the main disciples of the Lord Jesus:  the
Twelve and a band of women who ministered to Jesus and His disciples from their
means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul is aware that worldly possessions can divert even
the most fervent disciple from staying on the faith-filled track.  Paul wants
Timothy to recall all the teachings that Paul has shared with him. Personal
gratification can lead to all sorts of distortion in practicing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Christian life including jealousy, contention, and
mistrust.  Instead of being so concerned with the ways of the world, the true
disciple and leader should focus on being content with what one has, being
concerned for others, loving and caring for those whom the Lord Jesus has
entrusted to the disciple’s care.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist reaffirms trust in the benevolence of the
LORD.  The LORD GOD cares for those who trust in GOD.  All the worldly
possessions that one seeks to amass will not follow a person into the next
life.  In fact, being burdened with worldly concerns can weigh one down and
prevent one from attaining the riches of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, we have an insight into the traveling
companions of Jesus.  He is accompanied by the Twelve (the Apostles) and a
group</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of women who had been touched by the healing presence of the
Lord Jesus.  These women seem to have used their wealth and abilities to help
tend to the needs of Jesus and His band of Twelve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I am reminded of what my
focus must be as I seek to be a disciple of the Lord Jesus and a servant-leader
of others.  The focus cannot be on myself or the wealth, fame, and prestige I
can receive from others.  Being a true follower of Jesus means to be concerned
for the well-being (salus) of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I focus on my own selfish desires, it is easy to get
off track.  If I put more energy in amassing money</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and possessions, then I have less energy for spreading the
GOoD News of Jesus.  This can only lead to seeing others as my opposition who
are out to take what I have or what I want.  I become jealous, contentious, and
at odds with others.  It leads to further isolation and mistrust of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the other hand, if I focus on others and seek to help
them grow in the riches of GOD, then I am also enriched.  Yet being concerned
for others means I must be patient, helpful, loving, and full of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was impressed by the description of the women who
accompanied Jesus.  Yes, it is true that they had received salus (physical,
emotional, and/or spiritual healing and well-being) from Jesus, but they were
also willing to forsake their former ways and use their talents and wealth for
the care of Jesus and His Twelve and for the spread of the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes the greatest ministry I can perform is to support
and help equip others to do the ministry to which </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they are called.  I don’t always have to be in the forefront
and be one of the key people who announce the GOoD News.  True ministry is
focused on being sure that Jesus’ and His message is proclaimed.  If I am
blessed with riches, then I should be willing to use that wealth in fostering
the spread of the faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember reading about some students from La Salle High
School in Pasadena who lived out their life as faithful disciples of the Lord
Jesus.  This group of young people, including at least one of my former
students, went to Louisiana to help rebuild homes damaged in the aftermath of
the Katrina hurricane.  Even though it had been many years since the tragedy
struck that area, there was still a need to rebuild homes in the area,
especially since some areas have been struck by more recent hurricanes and
storms.  I was impressed that the students spent part of their summer doing
such a project of supporting the spread of the GOoD News to people who have
been experiencing bad news for many years.  They may not have been the
individuals who verbally proclaimed the Gospel, but their actions were
supportive in the proclamation of the Message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Discipleship takes many forms – preaching, living a
righteous (GOoD example) life, supporting others in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doing their ministry.  The most important aspect of
discipleship is to know Who must be the center of one’s life – Jesus.  When we
can focus on Jesus, we remove ourselves from the spotlight and focus on being
sure that the GOoD News is proclaimed in word and action and that Jesus and His
Abba-Father are praised.  As we heard in the readings today, we can never amass
enough to earn our salvation, but Jesus has redeemed us.  All we need do is be
His disciples and spread the faith and the truth in loving and caring manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What does it mean to
me to be called to be a disciple of the Lord Jesus?  How can I bolster the
ministry of others and enable them to minister to people whom I cannot minister
to directly or as well as others?  What can I do today to help others in their
ministry?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all richness.  Through Your
GOoDness, we are invited to share in Your wealth and to share Your wealth with
others.  Yet often we have sought our own riches rather than allow You to bless
us and use us for the blessing of others.  For our wanting to be self-sufficient
and therefore selfish, we ask Your forgiveness.  We thank You not only for
giving us the gift of faith and salvation, but also for allowing us to be
disciples of Your Son, Jesus.  May we do all we can to foster the spread of the

praise for You are our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Timothy 6: 13-16;         Psalm 100: 1b-2, 3,
4;         Luke 8: 4-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is calling us to a higher level of relationship with
GOD.  In the First Reading, St. Paul charges St. Timothy to continue to do what
he has been called to do until Jesus returns to unite all the faithful with His
Abba-Father.  The Responsorial Psalm reminds us that we need to joyfully
realize that we are in the presence of the LORD GOD.  In the Gospel Jesus
relates the parable of the sower scattering the seed, some of which falls on
GOoD soil and produces abundantly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As St. Paul comes to the end of this letter to St. Timothy,
he urges his protégé</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to remain faithful to the teachings and commandments that
have come from the Lord Jesus, through Paul, to him.  Timothy will be enabled
to do so if he is always aware, through faith, of the presence of the Lord
Jesus Who is coming again for the final revelation of the mystery of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a pilgrim hymn recounting the joy of coming
into the presence of GOD with joy.  The gladness flows from a realization of
the relationship the LORD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with those who are members of the flock of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to teach the message of the power of the Word of
GOD has in the life of one who spreads the faith, Jesus tells the parable of
the sower who scatters seed.  The full meaning of the parable is not given to
all the crowd.  Jesus reserves the explanation of the parable to His disciples. 
The seed is the Word of GOD that bears</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>abundant growth when it is planted in GOoD soil.  Sometimes
the Word falls upon individuals who are not prepared to fully receive the Word
because of external or internal distractions or obstacles. Only the soil that
is really ready for the Word will produce a hundredfold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings took on new meaning for me after an experience
given at the beginning of the academic year in a faith community.  I attended
an evening of reflection for people involved in ministry within a parish
community.  The pastor told all those who were present that they were not
volunteers, but that they had been called by GOD to their ministry (whether it
be instructing children in the faith, ministering at the altar, working with
teens, serving those who are experiencing the loss of loved one, or any other
caring of people).  He went on to tell those who had gathered that they were
being lifted up to a newer level of relationship with the Lord Jesus and in
doing so the whole faith community was also being lifted up to a higher
awareness of the presence of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the session continued, all those involved in service of
the community were reminded that they were called to model two very important
aspects of the life of Jesus Christ:  His incarnation and His exaltation on the
cross.  Through their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>acceptance of GOD’s call, they were called, like Mary, to be
the place where the Word of GOD took flesh again. Not in the sense of Jesus
being physically born as a human, but in the sense of the Word of GOD coming to
those in need, in the very flesh and skin of those who serve.  For when the
modern disciples of Jesus bring His Word to those whom they serve, the Word
(Jesus) is enfleshed in the hands and mouth and being of the one who announces
the GOoD News in speech and actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pastor also spoke of the need for those who minister in
the community to embody the crucifixion of the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus.  They are to be physical reminders of the love
that was manifested by Jesus in His death on the cross. Part of the way they
could do that would be through their attitude of prayer.  An attitude of prayer
includes not just the awareness of GOD’s constant presence in their lives, but
in the way they pray.  A physical reminder of that was suggested:  standing with
arms raised up, in the form of Jesus hanging on the cross.  While praying in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the cruciform stance, they were to be reminded of the total
submission and surrender to GOD that they were being asked to do, just as their
Master-Teacher completely surrendered to His Abba-Father on the cross.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect both on the readings today and the experience
of that night, I realize that each one of us who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accepts the call of the Lord Jesus is called to be in the
ever-expanding process of drawing further into the presence of, and
relationship to, the Lord Jesus and His Abba through the working of the Holy
Spirit.  It should be a joyful experience not only for ourselves but for those
whom we are called to serve; for responding to the Lord Jesus means serving
those whom GOD calls us to serve (just as Paul reminded Timothy).  When we say
that we are the servants of the Lord Jesus, it means we must  translate the
experience of our relationship with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord to others.  The Word of GOD has been planted in the
soil of our being, we are to allow it to produce</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hundredfold not only in our lives, but also in the people
whose lives we touch.  The more we are willing to be in prayer, particular with
the attitude of the Crucified One, the more we will be able to  translate GOD’s
Word so that others will fully understand the Word as GOD intends them to know
the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sense of joy and excitement was very evident that
evening as people realized that they were empowered with the Word of GOD and
they were the chosen and holy instruments of GOD’s presence to others.  As they
joined with the choir, which led the singing, they echoed the words of the
psalmist today:  “Sing joyfully to the LORD; serve the LORD with gladness, come
before the LORD with joyful song.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How open am I to the
Word of GOD taking root in me and producing abundant growth for my own sake and
the sake of others? What can I do to become more fertile ground in which the
Word of GOD can produce its effect? To whom am I being called to share the Word
of GOD and become an embodiment of the Word?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all growth.  Through Your
GOoDness You planted the seed of Your Word in the soil of human lives. 
Sometimes the soil of our lives has been hardened by people walking on it,
other times we have let the worldly ways choke the Word before it can fully
grow.  For the times we have hindered the Word growing within us, we seek Your
pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to allow Your Holy Spirit to till our soil
with wisdom and understanding so that we can be the place where Your Son, the
Word, takes flesh again as we live out our call to share the Word with others
through our teaching and acts of service.  May we continue to lift up our hands
in the attitude of the One Who was crucified for us and may we share our
experience of the love we have received from the One Who completely abandoned
Himself to You for our sake.  We join with Your Son, Jesus, Who is our Savior
and Master-Teacher, as He continues to praise You.  He is the One Who has died,
is risen and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Twenty-fifth Sunday in Ordinary Time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from:  http://usccb.org/bible/readings/092125.cfm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Matthew: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-matthew</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Amos 8: 4-7;      Psalm 113: 1-2, 4-6, 7-8;      
1 Timothy 2: 1-8;        Luke 16: 1-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Being intent on achieving an end can lead
one to expend time and energy on furthering the means to reach that end.  In
the First Reading, Amos chastises the dishonest merchants who seek the end of
the periods of holy times when no business can be conducted and who weight the
scales to their benefit when dealing with buyers.  The psalm praises the LORD
GOD Who will ultimately lift up the poor and downtrodden.  In the Second
Reading, St. Paul exhorts Timothy to have the faithful in the community at
Ephesus pray not only for their spiritual leaders, but also for all who
exercise authority over them and to have them work for the same purpose and
with the same intensity as GOD does – for the salvation of all people.  In the
Gospel, Luke presents Jesus telling the parable of the dishonest steward and
concluding the parable with three lessons dealing with usage of what we have,
fidelity of those in roles of responsibility, and the incompatibility of
serving GOD and any other purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The prophet Amos has seen the evil intent of
some merchants of his era.  They are so anxious to earn a profit that they
cannot wait for the holy days (Sabbath and new moon feasts) to be over so they
can get back to their cheating ways.  They seem to observe the Sabbath and
other Holy Days not because they are holy but because their customers are
following the law and would be upset with their failure to observe the day of
rest and days of holiness.  Their plans for operating include lessening the
size of the measurement of the product and the increasing of the value of the
money they are to be paid.   They are willing, according to the modern idiom,
to sell the shirts on their own mothers’ backs, in order to put more money in
their own accounts.  Amos reminds them that GOD sees their actions and knows
their plans and the LORD will not forget their evil intentions and practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The psalm builds on the final thought of
today’s readings.  GOD is to be praised because GOD sees the plight of the
Anawim – the “bend over ones” – the lowly and disenfranchised – and GOD will
lift them up and give them places of honor and respect, the very qualities that
the dishonest have tried to take from them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In his letter to his co-worker and protégé,
St. Timothy, St. Paul urges continued prayers for all who exercise authority,
both in the spiritual realm and in the material world.  Paul reiterates the
message that GOD desires that all people be saved, and he also reaffirms the
necessity of the faithful doing all in their power to work for the spreading of
the GOoD News of salvation.  Yes, there is only one GOD and only one mediator –
the Lord Jesus – but believers can further the Gospel by praying for others and
doing all they can to give testimony to the Truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today’s Gospel begins with the parable about
the unfaithful steward.  The steward seems to have misused that with which he
was entrusted by his master.  He has squandered what he was assigned to
protect.  Yet, the master gives a commendation to the dishonest steward for
being willing to forsake his usual exorbitant handling fees in order to win
favor from his master’s debtors.  Jesus then links three teachings to the
parable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the first teaching, Jesus challenges His
disciples to be as clever in proclaiming the Gospel as the dishonest steward
was in winning favor with his master’s debtors.  If His disciples would work as
diligently (and obviously in a truly honest manner) as the steward, then more
people would hear and come to believe in the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In the second lesson, Jesus is saying that
people will act in major decisions of their lives just as they do in minor
issues.  Thus, a person who is honest and responsible in small matters will
also be honest and responsible in larger matters.  The opposite is also true: a
dishonest individual in small matters will also be dishonest in greater ones.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The third, and often quoted, message Jesus
puts before His disciple is the notion that one can only be completely faithful
to one commitment – either to GOD or to worldly ways.  One cannot be completely
dedicated to GOD and GODly pursuits and also be totally invested in
non-spiritual pursuits.  One ultimately has to make a decision of where one is
going to channel one’s energies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As I reflect on the readings, I am
challenged to see where my true intentions are.  Am I putting all my efforts
into the furthering of the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus or am I selling out to
worldly ways?  If I am going to go with Jesus, then I must use every bit of
energy and thought in working for the Gospel and the Reign of GOD.  I must not
be anxious about fulfilling my Sunday obligation so I can get back to doing my
own thing after putting in my hour or so with the Lord Jesus.  I must seek to
bring the presence of Jesus to all those whom I meet.   It also includes my
spending time in prayer, seeking GOD’s blessing on everyone, even upon those
with whom I disagree or who have been placed in authority over me.  I cannot be
just an hour a week disciple of the Lord Jesus.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As I reflect on my commitment (or lack
thereof) to the Lord Jesus, I am reminded that I must follow the example of GOD
and of the Lord Jesus in the concern for the lowly and outcasts.  Yet, at
times, I try to rationalize my not getting involved with the Anawim of today
because I have seen how some dishonest individuals have used their proposed lowliness
to work the system on their own behalf.  I think to myself, “if they would use
the same efforts to work at an honest job, they would succeed.”  It is then
that I remember Jesus’ words challenging His disciples (including me) to be as
fervent and clever in spreading the GOoD News as the dishonest do in achieving
the ill-begotten possessions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                I also hear Paul’s words to Timothy:  “It is
my wish that in every place people should pray, lifting up holy hands without
anger or argument.”  If I was really intent on spreading the Gospel, I would
not try to analyze the behavior of others, but I would pray for and share the
GOoD News with all with whom I come in contact.  I would do all in my power,
and with GOD’s help, to work for GOD’s plan “that everyone be saved and come to
the knowledge of the truth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                If I can keep those thoughts before me, I
would be able to join the psalmist today and say, “Praise, you servants of the
LORD. . .Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forever.”  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Today is Catechetical Sunday in many
churches.  We should continue to honor those who are willing to share their
faith with others by being catechists (religious educators).  We also realize
that all of us are called to be involved in the catechetical ministry and be
proclaimers of the GOoD News to those with whom we come in contact – our
family, our co-workers, our friends, and those whom we encounter in our
day-to-day lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                                                                                                </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What or Who is the
master Whom I am willing to expend all my thoughts, efforts, and actions in
serving?   How often do I pray for all people, especially those in authority
(whether that be spiritual or secular)?  How do I reach out to the lowly?  What
can I do today, this week, to proclaim the GOoD News to someone who needs to
hear the Gospel?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the One and Only
GOD Who desires that all people be saved and share in Your gifts.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continually announce Your message to all peoples, especially to
those who are lowly.  In the fullness of time, You sent Your Son, Jesus, in
order to bring about the salvation of all the world.  He proclaimed Your
unconditional love through His teaching, His ministry, His death and His
resurrection.  Continue to empower us with Your Holy Spirit so we can work for
the spread of the Gospel.  We give You all the glory, praise, and honor in and
through the One and Only Mediator, Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Lorenzo Ruiz and Companions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-lorenzo-ruiz-and-companions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ezra 1: 1-6;        Psalm 126: 1b-2ab, 2cd-3,
4-5, 6;          Luke 8: 16-18</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD extends blessing to those who are faithful.  In our
First Reading, we hear that as the Babylonian exiles return to Jerusalem, they
are given gold, silver, and other treasures by their former captors.  The psalm
expresses the joy of the exiles as they head home realizing how GOD has done
great things for them.  In the Gospel, Jesus remarks that those who have been
enlightened must share their light with others, and in the process, they will
receive even more light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Book of Ezra sees King Cyrus of Persia as not only the
liberator of the exiles in Babylon, but also as the force behind the rebuilding
of the temple in Jerusalem.  The Jews would never have expected a foreign king
to be the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD-sent source of freedom and rebuilding in their lives. 
As Cyrus releases the Jews from their slavery, he sends them back to Jerusalem
to rebuild the Temple.  They are to be assisted in the rebuilding by their
former masters who are directed to contribute gold, silver, and other gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm describes the joy of the exiles as they leave
Babylon. GOD not only restores them to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their own land, but also in ways beyond their expectations,
GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>provides the wherewithal to rebuild the temple which the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Babylonians had destroyed.  Their rejoicing is like that of
the reapers who return with the harvest after having labored in the fields for
a long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus reminds the crowd that the purpose of a
lamp is to give light.  If one covers the lamp with a pot or hides the lamp</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>under the bed, then it cannot shine out its rays as it was
intended.  Jesus also remarks that those who have received blessings from GOD
will be blessed with even more if they are willing to share with others, while
those who are without, will have what little they possess taken away because of
not sharing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings made me think of the magnanimous nature of
GOD.  GOD is willing to bestow upon those who call upon the LORD in such
abundance.  All that is needed is the desire to have a closer relationship with
the LORD GOD.  The overly kind generosity of GOD may not always be at the time
we would like, but the way in which GOD enriches us according to the divine
timetable cannot even be imagined.  We will experience the joyful light of GOD,
particularly if we are willing to let that light shine on others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a hard message to grasp for those who are going
through rough times.  As they struggle with financial problems, marital or
other relational issues, physical conditions or illnesses, they cannot believe
that GOD is pouring out the divine blessings on them.  Yet, in time, as one
looks back on one’s whole life, one can see how GOD has abundantly blessed
those who seek to be faithful to GOD and enlighten others with the Light of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I read today’s passages, my thoughts go out to the people
who have suffered from the terrible events,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>either “natural” or human causes.  With the hurricanes, we
have seen the almost completely wiped-out islands and caused damage along the
Atlantic Coast of the United States.  Places have been cast in darkness because
of no power and stormy conditions.  People have died, and families have been
destroyed by the losses of the homes and loved ones.  Similarly, the people of
Ukraine have suffered in both physical and emotional darkness, having to hid
underground for long periods of time.  Yet, like the people experienced in
returning from the Exile in today’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First Reading, I believe GOD will do great things in the
lives of people who remain faithful to the LORD GOD. They will receive
blessings from others, even people who may have been “foreigners” or strangers
before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We who are not affected as others by disasters are called to
be light to those who are experiencing the darkness, not only because they may
have no power in their homes and some do not even homes, but also they </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>were going through “dark times.”  We can bring a sense of
hope and reassurance to such people by our prayers, thoughts, communication,
and contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of us are called to be sources of light for others. 
When we are willing to share what we have been given by the LORD, GOD does
marvelous things for those involved.  Let us continue to be open to the LORD’s
using us to bring light, joy, and blessings to others, so that they can say
with the psalmist today, “The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad
indeed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What have been my
experiences of being in the dark and having someone shed some light on my
situation, thus giving me hope?   What can I do to be a source of light to
others, so that they can see the great things the LORD is doing for them, even
in the midst of their darkness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all gifts.  Through Your
GOoDness we have been blessed in ways beyond our expectations.  Yet, at times
we focus only upon that which weighs us down and we forget that You continue to
send unexpected persons into our lives to bring us light, joy and a sense of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your love.  We thank You for sending Your Son to us and also
for allowing us to be Your instruments in sharing the Light of the GOoD News
with others.  Continue to enlighten us with Your Holy Spirit and empower us to
share Your light with others.  We make this prayer in and through Your Son,
Jesus, Who is our Savior and Master-Teacher, the Light of the World, as we
continue to praise You.  He is the One Who has died, is risen and is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Padre Pio:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-pio-of-pietrelcina</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ezra 6: 7-8, 12b, 14-20;         Psalm 122: 1-2,
3-4ab, 4cd-5;          Luke 8: 19-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When GOD’s will is obeyed, great things happen.  The First
Reading describes how the returning exiles are aided in their rebuilding of the
House of GOD and how they followed GOD’s orders exactly.  The Responsorial
Psalm is the hymn of the pilgrims and/or exiles coming to the Temple and
rejoicing to be in GOD’s presence.  In the Gospel, Jesus describes the members
of His and His Abba-Father’s family as those who do the will of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only does King Cyrus of Persia support the rebuilding of
the Temple by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>former exiles, but also his successor (Darius) does also. 
They not only permitted the reconstruction, but also told others to financially
support the effort to restore the Temple to its former glory.  After the
completion of the Temple, the Jewish people rejoice and celebrate the feast
days as described in Torah – Pentateuch – first five books of the Bible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm renders a picture of the great
excitement and joy of those who are approaching the Temple of GOD.  It was
something for which pilgrims and/or returning exiles longed.  It was not just a
joyous occasion for those privileged to enter the presence of GOD, but also it
was the fitting way for one to properly praise and thank GOD by being in the
divine presence as they experience it in the Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is notified that His mother and
relatives are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>outside.  Jesus responds not in a way of putting down His
blood relatives, but rather of showing the importance of being part of His
divine family.  The sign of one’s acceptance of being a part of the family of
GOD is doing the will of Jesus and His Abba.  The foremost human-only
individual in doing GOD’s will is Jesus’ mother, Mary.  This is what truly
makes her one with her Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It should be our desire to be in GOD’s presence not just now</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and not just in a particular holy building.  Our longing
should be to be with GOD forever in the eternal dwelling place of GOD.  We can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>begin to rejoice at being in GOD’s presence right now as we
become increasingly more aware that GOD is with us.  The realization of GOD’s
presence with us should motivate us to do the will of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on that, I realize that the more I am conscious
of GOD’s being with me at all times, the more I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>want to do GOD’s will and avoid anything that would hinder
my relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the unity with the Holy Spirit.  Yet, being human, it is
easy to be distracted and forget that I am in the presence of GOD at all
times.  This is particularly so when we are busy with our normal routine or are
burdened with the pressures of life.  It is even more difficult when we are
tempted by the enemy to doubt that GOD is with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was talking with someone a while ago and the person said
that with all the negative and evil things happening in the world and particularly
in the person’s personal life, it was hard to focus on being in GOD’s
presence.  This person really felt attacked by the enemy and realized that the
enemy was trying to cause a lack of faith.  Emotional, physical, mental, and/or
spiritual pain can make one question the presence of GOD.  A similar experience
seems to have plagued Saint Mother Theresa of Calcutta during the last part of
her life.  Although she sought to do GOD’s will and spend hours each day in
prayer, she did not always “feel” GOD’s presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A similar experience happened to the exiles while they were
in Babylon.  They had wondered if they would ever return to be in GOD’s
presence.  After a period of time, they not only were allowed to return to
Jerusalem, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but also, were supported in the restoring of the Temple, the
Dwelling Place of GOD.  Something else happened during the exile.  Many of the
Chosen People came to the realization that GOD was not just in the Temple in
Jerusalem, but also the LORD was present with them even in exile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A similar experience may be that of the “exiles” from the
natural disasters such as the recent earthquake or the hurricanes that have
struck various parts of our world, or the pandemic, or those who have fled
their homeland in Ukraine.  With homes damaged or destroyed, they may wonder if
GOD is with them.  Yet, often many of these “exiles” are able to thank GOD for
the gift of life, the gift of their families, and the generosity of so many
people who make it possible for them to begin again and realize that GOD is
with them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As disciples of the Lord Jesus, we are called to keep our
eyes focused on Him and to realize that the He and His Abba are with us.  We
are members of the family of GOD and we are sisters and brothers of the Lord
Jesus. That should spur us to live as children of GOD and doing the will of the
One Who loves us and has sent us Jesus as our Brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the slogan WWJD (which stands for “What
Would Jesus Do?”). [At an early morning Bible</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Study one of the participants said it should be WWJHMD –
“What Would Jesus Have Me Do?”]  If we are conscious of the Lord Jesus being
with us and that we are sisters and brothers of Jesus, we would do what Jesus,
our Brother would do – we would do His will and the will of our Abba, and the
prompting of the Holy Spirit is leading us to do.  It is then we could
paraphrase today’s psalm and say, “I rejoice because they reminded me, ‘We are
in the presence of the LORD.’  We are walking with GOD right now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
forgotten or not felt the presence of the Lord Jesus with me?  What reminded me
of GOD’s presence?  How can I help others experience the presence of the Lord
Jesus with them, especially as they feel alone, forsaken, and/or depressed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all time and places.  Through
Your GOoDness You remain with us at all times.  Through Your Son, You invite us
to be Your daughters and sons, and sisters and brothers of Jesus.  You promise
the presence of Your Holy Spirit in our lives to strengthen us and give us the
wisdom to live as members of Your family.  Yet, like wayward children, we
sometimes have forgotten of whose family we are a part.  We have even refused
to be associated with Your family because it would require us to live as Your
children.  For those times, we ask for Your understanding and forgiveness.  May
we always seek to do Your will as our way of giving You thanks and walking in
Your presence.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Who is our
Brother and Savior, Who has died, is risen, and Who is now living and reigning
with You and the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Henry Newman:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-henry-newman</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ezra 9: 5-9;        Tobit 13: 2, 3-4a, 4befghn,
7-8;          Luke 9: 1-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has a plan for humankind, both for individuals and for
humanity as a whole.  In the First Reading today, Ezra, the priest of the
Chosen People, realizes that GOD’s loving plan not only includes allowing the
Jews to be taken into exile in Babylon, but also involves their return to the
Promise Land and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem.  The Responsorial
echoes the words of Ezra in giving praise to GOD for permitting the Chosen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People to return to their land.  In the Gospel, as a
continuation of His ministry, Jesus sends out the Twelve</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Apostles) to preach and heal as signs of the spread of the
GOoD News of GOD’s love for the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After experiencing the exile, Ezra is privileged to see the
restoration of the Jewish people to their homeland and the rebuilding of the
Temple at the hands of Cyrus, King of Persia.  Ezra sees the hand of GOD at
work in the events that take place.  He realizes that GOD can work through even
non- believers, such as Cyrus, to bring about the divine plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is from the Book of Tobit and recalls the
Babylonian Exile.  GOD is praised even while the Chosen People are scattered
among the nations.  The final plan of GOD is revealed in GOD’s forgiving the
sins of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people and restoring them to their land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus commissions (Jesus “apostles” – sends
out) the Twelve to do the same activities He has performed:  proclaiming the
GOoD News in word and in action.  The Twelve are not to take extra supplies but
to rely on GOD to supply their needs in food, clothing, and every other way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind me that GOD has a plan.  GOD wants all
people to come to know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the divine love that GOD has for them.  Sometimes GOD’s plan
is side- tracked by evil, sinfulness, and poor choices on the part of humans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s plan, however, will not be undone or thwarted.  Just
as GOD restored the exiles to the Promise Land, so GOD will lead back all those
who have strayed from the LORD GOD, as long as they are willing to cooperate
with the will of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What still is unbelievable to me is the fact that part of
the plan of GOD is to involve humans in the proclaiming of the GOoD News.  It
was not enough that GOD’s plan included the sending of the Son to evangelize
the world and bring about the salvation of all.  GOD went even further and commissioned
mere mortals to continue the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>work of Jesus.  GOD empowered the disciples of Jesus with
the same authority and power so that the GOoD News would be announced
throughout the world and for the rest of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most unbelievable part of GOD’s plan is that the Lord
Jesus wants you and me to be heralds of the Gospel to those who cross our paths
– to our family members, our co-workers, and to people whom we meet. GOD
entrusts the ministry of Jesus to all of us, not just the ordained clergy or
paid church staff members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some may say, “Well, we do not have the power to heal and
cure like the original Twelve.”  I would respond and say, “Yes, we do have the
power, the power of the Holy Spirit, but we may have not realized it and put it
into practice.”  By our loving compassion and care for others, we are
demonstrating the powers that we have been given.  The miracles the Lord Jesus
does through us may not be as dramatic as some we read about in the Gospel and
the Act of the Apostles, but they are miracles, nonetheless. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Have you ever heard someone say that what you said or did
was nothing short of miraculous? Have you so touched a person’s life that they
sense the presence of GOD in their lives? Has anyone been lifted up (edified)
by your words or actions?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we but open our eyes and seek to respond to GOD’s plan,
then we would be overwhelmed with how GOD is allowing miracles to happen. 
GOD’s plan of announcing the GOoD News to the world involves each of us. We
share in the ministry of Jesus.  We can be a part of GOD’s miracles still
taking place.  We, like the Twelve, must rely on the Lord Jesus and realize
that GOD will not only take care of us, but also GOD will direct us in a way
that will further the spread of the Gospel.  If we turn to the Lord Jesus and
trust that GOD is active in our lives, we will see the plan of GOD being
unfolded, and then we can turn to GOD and praise the LORD as the Responsorial
says:  “Bless the LORD, all you GOD’s chosen ones, and may all of you praise
the majesty of the LORD.  Celebrate days of gladness, and give praise to the
LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    When have I
experienced the marvelous deeds of GOD happening in my life?   How has that
changed the way I reach out and proclaim GOD’s GOoD News? What can I do to be
more pro-active in my living out the call to serve others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all times.  Through Your
GOoDness, the GOoD News is proclaimed to all who are open to it.  In the
furthering of the Gospel, Your Son, Jesus, sent forth the “Apostles” (“the Sent
Ones”).  We are part of the apostolic Church and are called to continue the
ministry of Jesus in our time.  At times we have been reluctant to proclaim the
GOoD News.  We have been fearful of what will happen to us.  We have held back
from fully trusting in Your providence.  For the times we have failed to preach
the GOoD News by our actions and words, we seek Your forgiveness.  Continue to
make us aware of the prompting of the Holy Spirit so we may minister to those
whom You have placed into our care.  And may we always praise and thank You,
together with Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, the Master-Teacher Who
has trained us and commissioned to work within Your plan of salvation.  It is
in His name we raise this prayer, for He has died, is risen, and now is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saints Louis Martin and Zélie Guerin:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saints-louis-martin-and-zelie-guerin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Haggai 1: 1-8;         Psalm 149: 1b-2, 3-4, 5-6a
and 9;          Luke 9: 7-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can be easy to misunderstand GOD and the divine plan.  In
the First Reading, the prophet Haggai sees that the returning exiles are
focused on their own issues rather than seeking to do what GOD wants.  The
Responsorial Psalm reminds us that the LORD takes delight in the people who do
GOD’s will.  In the Gospel, King Herod tries to see and figure out Who Jesus
is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Haggai is considered the first prophet after the
Babylonian exile.  The people have started to return to the Promised Land. 
They are intent on rebuilding their own homes while not devoting themselves to
repairing the House of GOD (the Temple).  Haggai challenges the people,
especially the wealthy, to rebuild the Temple first.  He points out that their
own labors and efforts are not being fully realized because they have not given
their attention first to GOD and the Temple – GOD’s dwelling place among them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm urges the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chosen People to praise and thank GOD by singing and dancing
joyfully for the LORD.  The LORD will then respond by showing delight in the
people who honor their GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel shows both Herod’s interest in Jesus and
confusion about who Jesus is. This paradoxical concern re- surfaces later in
Luke’s Gospel (Chapter 13) and will reach its</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>climax when the arrested Jesus is brought before Herod
(Chapter 23).  The purpose is not to focus on Herod but upon the person of
Jesus.  Herod’s question (“Who then is this Person about Whom I have heard?”)
is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>question that is answered in the rest of Luke’s Gospel. 
Today, it should also lead the inquiring person to a closer study of, and
relationship with, the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, especially the Gospel, I
realize that I must answer Herod’s question.  I must obviously answer that
question for myself, but also for those who look to me for some sort of
understanding of how Jesus affects me and my life, and also affects them and
their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a retreat I led, I pictured the stages of becoming a
disciple in three steps, all beginning with the letter C: Curious, Convinced,
and  Committed.  People, even Herod, are curious about Who Jesus is and what He
is doing.  Curiosity draws us closer to Jesus.  His teaching and miracles make
Him a person of interest.  Having curiosity is not the end, but just the
beginning of being a disciple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I and others spend more time delving into His words, I
become more convinced of Jesus’ message and mission.  Jesus wants to bring us
GOoD News.  He wants us to know how much GOD, His Abba-Father loves us.  It
becomes obvious as we reflect on His ministry of preaching and healing.  Yet
being convinced is not enough, for even the devil is convinced about Who Jesus
is (Luke 4: 34).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third stage is that of being committed.  It means we are
willing to dedicate ourselves and our whole life to being a disciple of Jesus. 
It is a total commitment of our thoughts, words, and actions.  We are ready to
risk everything in order to further His Gospel.  The third stage is both the
most difficult and also the most rewarding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It means that everything we say and do should be a
reflection of what Jesus said and did during His earthly existence.  Our lives
should be a song to the Lord Jesus that attracts others to the Song Writer and
Song Master.  We should be singing the Lord Jesus’ praises in our every
movement and thought (see Responsorial).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Curiosity is the initial attraction to Jesus and His
mission. Being convinced is the mental affirmation to what we come to believe. 
Commitment, however, is the true mark of a disciple of the Lord Jesus.  It is
what empowers us to spread our faith and the Gospel.  If we are willing to be
committed disciples of Jesus, then we will sing to the LORD GOD a new song and
we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will praise GOD and exult in GOD’s glory as the psalmist
urges in today’s Responsorial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   In which stage am
I today in regards to my relationship with Jesus? The stage of being curious
about Jesus and His life? The stage of being convinced of His position as GOD’s
Son and the Savior?  The stage of being totally committed to being His
disciple? How do I profess my commitment to Jesus by the type of life that I
lead? Does my life sing GOD’s praise? Can other people tell where I am in my
relationship with the Lord Jesus?  Does my lifestyle invite others to move into
a relation that grows from being curious, to convinced, and ultimately to being
committed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all people and times.  Through
Your GOoDness, You have made known Your love for Your people by leading them
through a process of being curious, convinced, and finally committed to You,
Your Son, and Your Holy Spirit.  Because of fears of what the commitment might
entail, we have shrugged off the total giving of ourselves to the spread of the
Gospel.  As You touch us again with Your forgiveness, empower us to be
committed disciples of Your Son and His mission of bringing GOoD News to
others.  We give You all the glory and praise that is due to You, for You are
our loving GOD, our Abba through Jesus.  We lift up this prayer in Jesus’ name
for He is our Lord and Master-Teacher, our Savior and Redeemer, our Brother,
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Pope Paul VI:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-paul-vi</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Haggai 2: 1-9;           Psalm 43: 1, 2, 3,
4;            Luke 9: 18-22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The role of the Messiah (the Christ) has been a source of
reassurance and also confusion for people over the millennia.  In the First
Reading, Haggai prophesies that the future glory of the Temple will be greater
than the former, not just because it is being rebuilt, but because the Messiah
will come to the Temple.  The psalm gives hope to those who feel oppressed,
reassuring them that they will rejoice as they go into the presence of the
LORD. The Gospel presents the account of Jesus questioning His disciple on what
people think of Him, leading Peter to profess that Jesus is the Messiah (the
Christ) of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the exiles return to Jerusalem, they are disillusioned at
the Temple being in ruin.  A few of the elders can remember the former,
glorious Temple.  They wonder if the Temple will ever be able to be as
magnificent as it had been.  The prophet Haggai tells the king, the high
priest, and the people that GOD will not only restore the Temple to its
previous, honorable state, but will make it better.  This will come about not
just with the adornment of the building with silver and gold, but with something
better.  The people of Haggai’s time and afterwards see this as a renewal of
the promise by GOD to send the Messiah (Christos – the Anointed One).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like the words of Haggai, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>psalm is meant to be a source of hope to those who feel
burdened</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and who need some sort of edification.  The psalmist is
besieged by faithless enemies.  The only source of encouragement and uplifting
is the LORD.  Coming into the presence of GOD in the Temple brings gladness and
joy.  In Latin the phrase “ad Altare DEI” means “to the Altar of GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, after a time of reflection and prayer alone
by Himself,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus questions His disciples about what people are saying
about Him. They respond that some think He is John the Baptist resurrected, or
a prophet.  Jesus continues the questioning by asking them, “Who do you say I
am?”  Peter proclaims that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah – the Anointed One)
of GOD.  Jesus immediately links this concept of Messiahship to His future
suffering, death, and resurrection, something that the disciples were not
expecting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the concept of the Messiah, I realize that
the Jewish people were (and most still are) constantly awaiting the coming of
the Messiah – the promised Anointed One of GOD.  Their understanding of the
role of Messiah varied over the centuries.  Most of the Hebrew faithful
believed that the Messiah would be a liberator who would throw off any form of
oppression and set the people free of foreign powers.  This vision saw the
Messiah as a military leader.  With great military might, the Messiah would
also bring a new sense of healing for those who were sick, freedom for the
captives, a sense of justice for those who were unjustly treated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few people were hoping that the Messiah would bring about
a spiritual renewal and a return to orthodoxy. These individuals were of the
opinion that the Jewish faith was becoming too watered down and not as
authentic as it had been in the past.  They wanted a return to the pristine
faith of yesteryear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Very few Jewish people envisioned the Messiah as a person
Who would lift the level of faith to a new plane and empower believers to have
a deeper and more personal relationship with GOD.  It was beyond the
imagination of almost all Jews that the Messiah would be divine – One Who is
part of the deity, both GOD and human at the same time.  And that the Messiah
would suffer and die was totally beyond anyone’s understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, living in the twenty-first century, are blessed with
20-20 hindsight, at least from an historical perspective. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of us who have been followers of Jesus our whole lives
know what we have been taught, that Jesus is the Son of GOD, the Christ (the
Messiah – the Anointed One), Who was born, lived, ministered, suffered, died
and rose again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, we have the understanding of Jesus that our Jewish
ancestors could not even begin to fathom.  The question, however, is still
important for us to answer:  “Who do we say that Jesus is?”  The answer should
be much more than a recitation of part of our creed.  It should be proclaimed
by our lifestyle.  If we really believe that Jesus is the Son of GOD, the
Christ, the Savior, the Anointed One Who announces GOoD News by His very life,
ministry, death, and resurrection, then our lives should manifest that.  We
should proclaim that belief with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our actions even louder than Peter did in words in the
Gospel.  Our lives should be affirmations that Jesus is the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Christ and that we have been beneficiaries of His saving
actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are called “Christians” because we share the life of the
Christ (the Anointed One), we are partakers of His name and ministry.  We are
also anointed (at our baptism and confirmation).  We are called to continue the
ministry of Jesus – announcing a time of divine favor and blessing, of healing
and restoration, of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Think about Peter and his profession of faith.  He had the
right words at this point in his life with Jesus. Putting the words into action
was something he had to work on the rest of his life.  He did not have it “all-
together” at the moment he said, “You are the Christ of GOD.”  That should be
encouraging for us.  Most of us do not have it “all-together” yet either.  Our
lives are still being formed into the image of the Christ.  We, like Peter,
have sometimes denied our relationship with Jesus.  We have misunderstood what
we are called to do. Thank GOD, that GOD is not finished with us yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, we must strive to be more Christ-like, yet, like Peter,
we may slip and fall on our journey with the Lord Jesus.  Yet, if we strive to
profess our faith both in word and in action, then we can join the psalmist
today and pray, “Send forth Your light and Your fidelity; they shall lead me on
and bring me to Your holy mountain, to Your dwelling-place.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What do I
understand as the meaning of the Messiah (the Christ, the Anointed One)? Who is
Jesus to me? How does my life proclaim my belief in Jesus as the Christ?  Is
there someone with whom I can share my understanding of Jesus as the Christ, at
least in my way of acting like Christ Jesus, with love and compassion?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all who seek to be with You in
Your eternal dwelling place.  Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your
Anointed One, the Christ, the Messiah.  It is none other than Your Son, Jesus.
He continues to ask us, “Who do you say that I am?”  We have at times been able
to say the right words, but we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have often failed to live out our profession of faith in
action.  For this we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  By the power and guidance
of Your Holy Spirit, help us to develop an even closer relationship with You
through Your Son.  Empower us through the Holy Spirit to profess by our way of
life that Jesus is the Christ, Your Anointed One.  We lift this prayer in His
name, for He is Your Son and our Brother, the Christ, our Savior and
Master-Teacher, Who has died, and Who is risen.  He is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Zechariah 2: 5-9, 14-15a;        Jeremiah 31: 10,
11-12ab, 13;        Luke 9: 43b-45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, we are reminded of the role of the Messiah.  The
passage from the prophet Zechariah and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Responsorial from Jeremiah are both reminders that the LORD
GOD has promised to come in order to take care</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the Chosen People and extend the divine care to all
peoples.  In the Gospel, Jesus once again predicts His own suffering and death
– the means through the Messiah is manifested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Zechariah lived about the same time as the
prophet from whom we heard yesterday – Haggai (mid sixth century B.C.).  He is
led to proclaim the Word of the LORD that speaks about the LORD’s coming to
Jerusalem to dwell with the people and draw in, not only the Chosen People, but
other nations.  This will be a time of joy and happiness, especially to those
who have just returned from the Babylonian exile and see their city in ruin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is from the prophet Jeremiah and describes
GOD’s role of shepherding the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because the LORD will gather the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people who have scattered and will place them under divine
protection and care, it is something in which to rejoice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as Jesus reiterates that His role as Messiah
includes being turned over to His enemies and His suffering and death, the
disciples are confused.  They cannot, at this point in their journey of faith,
understand why or how Jesus must suffer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following the Lord Jesus, I have come to experience and
realize, is not always easy nor is it always fun.  There</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are times when I have not understood how GOD operates in my
life or in the lives of others.  Suffering, particularly, is something that is
hard to fully comprehend.  No wonder so many people question that if GOD is a
loving, shepherding GOD Who comes to dwell with us, why does GOD allow us to
suffer so much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember being in indirect contact with a couple who went
through the experience of losing their infant child.  They wondered why GOD did
not do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more to help them in their present suffering.  I guess that
is one of the reason that Jesus, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD-man, was willing to undergo suffering Himself, so that
we could realize that GOD is not above experiencing suffering, but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is totally compassionate about (“suffering with”) our
suffering. I was touched by the email they sent out a few weeks after the death
of their baby, Christian.  They still do not fully understand why Christian
died, but their deep faith allowed them to accept it and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>trust that GOD was going to see them through.  In their
email, they said that they were looking forward to GOD allowing them to
conceive again and pray that they will then have a healthy baby to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>whom they can give their love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I have ministered to people, it pains me to see GOoD
people (and even not-so-GOoD people) suffer so much.  It seems that some of the
people who have had the strongest faith I have known are the very people who
have also had some of the most tragic and difficult lives.  They have striven
to do the will of GOD and are experiencing some of the most excruciating (“from
the cross”) physical, emotional, and/or mental pains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I was consoling a friend after a very tearful experience
of dealing with relational problems, I was reminded of one saint (St. Teresa of
Avila).  She was traveling along a road and had all sorts of problems.  She
finally fell in the mud and asked GOD, “Why did You let me fall into the mud.” 
GOD answered, “Because you are my friend!  I treat all my friends this way.” 
She reported responded, “No wonder You have so few friends if You treat them
this way!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The GOoD News of today’s readings is that the Lord Jesus has
come to us as our GOoD Shepherd.  Not only has GOD become human and shared in
the limitedness of our humanity in the person of Jesus, but Jesus has shown
that He was willing to undergo suffering and death, even the most excruciating
death on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a cross, to demonstrate divine compassion.  If His
Abba-Father allowed Him to be in so much pain and made that pain a source of
our salvation, then the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>problems we face should not makes us doubt GOD’s presence
with us.  Our response must be that of Jesus during His agony in the garden: 
“Abba, if You are willing, take this cup away from Me; still, not My will but
Yours be done” (Luke 22: 42).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we are willing to be aware of the presence of the Lord
Jesus, then the Word of GOD spoken through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jeremiah in the Responsorial today will be the Word GOD
speaks to us:  “I will turn [your] mourning into joy, I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will console and gladden [you] after [your] sorrows.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When have I
questioned GOD’s compassion as I have endured great suffering (physical,
intellectual, financial, mental, or spiritual)? What reassurance did I receive
that helped me through those painful times?  Thinking about Jesus’ willingness
to share in our humanity and suffer with us, what does that say to me about
GOD’s compassion (“suffer” “with”)?   How can I show more of GOD’s compassion
to people who are suffering from any sort of distress or pain?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all compassion.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have demonstrated Your willingness to be with us during our most
trying moments.  Not only are You willing to shepherd us and care for us, but
through Your Son, You have shown that You walk with us in our suffering and
pain.  For the times we have so focused on our pain that we have not realized
Your presence with us – comforting us and healing us – we ask for Your pardon
and forgiveness.  Continue to pour Your Holy Spirit into our lives with
comfort, strength, and wisdom so that we will be bolstered in our faith
journey.  We thank Your for sending Your Son to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>share fully in our humanity even to the point of suffering
and dying for us.  We make this prayer in His name for He is our compassionate
GOoD Shepherd, our Master-Teacher and suffering Lord, Who has died, but is
risen and living with us and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Amos 6: 1a, 4-7;     Psalm 146: 7, 8-9, 9-10;    
1 Timothy 6: 11-16;     Luke 16: 19-31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wealth and poverty could be the focus of today’s readings,
but so could the attitude one has towards possessions or the lack thereof. 
Amos condemns the complacency of the rich of his day who seek only fine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things for themselves at the cost of others.  The
Responsorial Psalm reminds us that GOD cares for the lowly, the poor, and the
suffering.  In the Second Reading, Paul encourages his protégé, Timothy, to
pursue the virtuous</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life.  Jesus, in the Gospel, relates the parable of the rich
man who fails to even meet the basic needs of the poor Lazarus, and then
realizes, all too late, that Lazarus enjoys eternal riches while he suffers
eternal want because of the attitudes each had on earth and their actions
resulting from their attitudes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amos, the shepherd and caretaker of sycamore trees in the
southern kingdom of Judah, responds to GOD’s call by addressing some
castigating words against the wealthy people of the northern kingdom of Israel.
Because of their attitude of seeking worldly wealth at the cost of the poor,
they will experience the fall of their kingdom and the exile of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Amos tries to shake the complacent people of Israel into
repentance and to a change of attitude, but all he receives for his mission is
ridicule and rejection. Yet, in the end Amos’ warning of the impending fall of
the northern kingdom comes true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm emphasizes that GOD takes a liking to
the poor and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the lowly, even though the world despises them.  GOD is the
champion of rejected and suffering individuals.  The LORD sees into the hearts
of individuals and raises up those who are bowed down (the Anawim).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his letter to Timothy, St. Paul reminds</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Timothy of what it means to be a person who has been chosen
by GOD to be a leader.  Timothy must search after, and seek to be, a person of
righteousness, devotion, faith, love, patience, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gentleness.  These qualities should affect Timothy’s
ministry to the people of Ephesus as he lives out the calling he has received
from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus addresses the Pharisees with the
parable of the rich man and Lazarus.  The rich man lives a life of luxury while
the poor Lazarus suffers from hunger and disease.  After both die, Lazarus
enjoys life with Abraham, while the rich man experiences torment in flames. 
The rich man seeks to receive some kindness from Lazarus, even though he failed
to show any kindness to him while they were both on earth.  When Abraham
remarks that the abyss between the heavenly experience and that of hellish life
cannot be bridged, the rich man asks that Lazarus be able to return to earth to
warn the rich man’s brothers of what their fate will be if they continue to
live the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>lifestyle of the rich and famous.  Abraham, referring to the
coming resurrection of Jesus, remarks that people will not believe even if
someone would rise from </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am struck by the attitude of
the rich.  It is not so much that having wealth is bad per se.  It is the
attitude of choosing to keep one’s eyes closed to the needs of others that is
wrong.  The people of Amos’ day and the rich man in the Gospel sinned because
they blinded themselves by their complacency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They thought things were fine just the way they were.  They
failed to see beyond themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the concern that Paul voices to Timothy.  If one is
to be a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, one must pursue virtue.  The word
“pursue” implies a conscientious exertion of thoughtfulness and energy toward a
particular end.  What is to be pursued are virtues that not only refer to our
relationship with GOD, but also to our concern for, and awareness of, others. 
If one is conscious of being a person who is seeking devotion, love,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>patience, and gentleness, one will see the needy and
minister to them, since that is what the LORD GOD does as is obvious in today’s
Responsorial Psalm and in the life and ministry of our Master-Teacher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a very practical way, today’s readings should cause us to
examine our lives in regard to our attitude to possessions and in regard to
helping those who are less fortunate than ourselves.  I think of my own
attitude toward the poor.  Yes, I donate to charitable causes.  Yet I sometimes
fail to go out of my way to really minister to those who are lowly and poor.  I
may not willfully hold back my “wealth” from those who are destitute, but I do
not “pursue” (take proactive measures toward) those to whom I could make a
difference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sure, it would be nice to have a load of many things and not
have to worry about always paying bills.  Yet, I cannot take all the paid bills
with me to heaven and say to the Lord Jesus, “See I met all my debts.”   More
importantly I must “pursue” ways in which I can manifest my loving concern for
those who are bowed down (the Anawim).  I must consciously deal with those who
need my help with patience and gentleness.  I must not let my desire to have a
comfortable existence make me complacent and blind to the needs of others.  I
must strive to be as faith-full and loving as the GOD Who, as today’s psalm
says, “keeps faith forever and secures justice for the oppressed, gives food to
the hungry. . .sets captives free. . .gives sight to the blind. . . raises up
those who were bowed down. . .loves the just. . .protects the strangers. . .”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:     In what ways
have I been blinded by complacency? How have I pursued the virtues that would
be a sign of my living out my call as a disciple of the Lord Jesus?  Who is the
most needy person(s) in my life today and how can I tend to his/her/their
needs?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the One Who keeps faith forever
by tending to the needs of Your people. Through Your GOoDness, You reach out to
those who are in need of Your help.  You also call others to pursue lifestyles
that proclaim Your faithfulness as they serve the downtrodden.  For the times
we have been complacent and uncaring to those to whom we could make a
difference, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness. Helps us to always keep the
example of Your Son, Jesus, ever before us.  Through the continued guidance of
Your Holy Spirit, helps us to look beyond ourselves to those who are in need of
Your loving help and our bringing that help to them.  We continue to lift up a
prayer of praise and thanks to You, in and through Your Son Jesus, our Savior
and Master-Teacher, Who spent His earthly life ministering to the lowly,
suffering with them, Who has died, is risen and is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Daniel 7: 9-10, 13-14          or           
Revelation 12: 7-12ab; Psalm 138: 1-2ab, 2cde-3, 4-5;           John 1: 47-51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings are chosen for the Feast of the Archangels
(Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel).  The first of the two choices of the First
Reading is from Daniel and is part of Daniel’s heavenly vision.  Later in
Daniel’s vision (Daniel 10: 13) Michael, the chief prince, is mentioned.  The
alternate First Reading from the Book of Revelation is also a heavenly vision. 
In this passage Michael and the other GOoD angels fight against Satan and cast
the Devil and the rest of the rebellious heavenly beings out of heaven.  The
psalm is a hymn of praise that is sung “in the presence of the angels.”  Jesus,
in the Gospel, pictures the angels of GOD surrounding the “Son of Man.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daniel’s vision of heaven focuses on the Ancient One (GOD –
Abba-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father) and the Son of Man (GOD the Son).  It is only later
in Daniel’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>vision that the angel Michael is mentioned.  Michael is seen
(as the word “angel” means) as the “messenger” of GOD who does GOD’s will. 
Michael is described as the chief (or “arch”) messenger (or “angel”), thus he
is an “archangel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A similar view of Michael is presented in the Book of
Revelation.  Once again Michael is the leader (first, “arch”) of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>angels.  He is pictured as leading the heavenly forces in a
battle against Satan and the other rebellious spiritual beings.  With GOD’s
help, Michael and the angels expel Satan and his company out of heaven. The
result of this angelic battle is that GOD and His Anointed One (“Christ”)
receive the praise and glory that rightfully belongs to the GODhead without the
mutinous cries from the opposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm praises GOD in the Holy Temple.  The psalmist
joins the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>choirs of angels who constantly sing GOD’s glory.  Part of
the “job” of the “messengers-angels” of GOD is to give GOD unending praise and
thanks.  This function is done not only in heaven, but also wherever GOD’s
presence is manifested, thus in the Temple and elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel passage shows a link between Jesus and the
“Anointed One” of GOD Who comes with foreknowledge and Who is ministered to by
the angels-“messengers” of GOD.  Jesus’ being able to see Nathanael and “know”
him even before Philip calls him is one link to the Messiah (“Anointed One” –
“Christ”) Who was promised in Hebrew Scriptures.  Jesus also forecasts that
GOD’s messengers (angels) will tend to and serve the Son of Man just as they
minister to GOD in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we honor the three “messengers” who are given names in
Scriptures.  The word “angel” comes from the Greek word angelos (αγγελος) and
means “messenger” or “announcer.”  Those who are the “chief” (Greek αρχ - arch
) messengers are the “archangels.”  Michael is seen as the one who battles
against the demonic forces. The name “Michael” is Hebrew for “One who is like
GOD.”  Gabriel is the messenger who is sent to announce the birth of both John
the Baptist and Jesus.  “Gabriel” means “Strength of GOD” in Hebrew.  Raphael
is only </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>mentioned in the Book of Tobit.  As the name “Raphael” means
“Healed by GOD,” Raphael brings GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>healing to the family of Tobit by healing Tobit of
blindness, uniting Tobias (Tobit’s son) with Sarah, and reuniting the family of
Tobit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the supernatural beings whom we call angels,
I realize that their function is to serve GOD in whatever way the LORD GOD
intends.  Part of the function of these “messengers” is to announce and
proclaim GOD’s glory, so that there is constant praise and honor given to GOD. 
Sometimes, it seems, GOD sends these “messengers” to humans to proclaim special
messages or to help in the struggle humans have against the forces of the
fallen “angels” led by Satan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most important thing for me is to realize that GOD is
worthy of praise, not just by the angels, but also by me and all others who
call upon the name of the LORD GOD.  Linked to this is the concept that GOD
wants us to be informed of the divine love and the heavenly care that is
constantly flowing from GOD.  If GOD chooses to send “heavenly messengers” to
us to reassure us of this GOoD News, that is GOD’s prerogative.  My part is
that I must be open to GOD’s evangelizing (announcing “GOoD Message” to) me and
others in whatever way GOD chooses.  Obviously the most dramatic and best GOoD
News came in the person of Jesus.  Yet sometimes we miss the point of Jesus’
coming and we need to be reminded of message of GOD’s love through other
“messengers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue to grow in the understanding and appreciation
of how much GOD loves us, let us join the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>choirs of angels in singing GOD’s praises, not just
eventually in heaven, but wherever we are.  May we give GOD glory by helping to
further the announcement of the message of GOoD News in our every action and
word.  Then truly we will be able to echo the words of the psalmist today and
say:  “I will give thanks to You, O LORD, with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all my heart. . .in the presence of the angels I will sing
Your praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my
understanding and thoughts about angels?  Does my contemplation on angels draw
me into a closer relationship with the GOD Whose message they proclaim and
Whose glory they sing? How can I be more open to GOD’s self-revelations,
primarily in scripture, but also through other humans and possibly supernatural
creatures?   What can I do to help announce the GOoD News message to others and
thus be “angelic” in my actions and words?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all GOoD News.  Through Your
GOoDness You continue to send Your “messengers” to proclaim the announcement of
salvation.  We thank You for all those who have evangelized us whether they be
fellow humans, heavenly beings, or (especially) Your Son, Who is Your Message
or Word Incarnate and the true Messenger of salvation, in actions as well as in
word.  We have not always been open to Your message or Your messengers.  For
this we seek Your forgiveness.  Continue to pour out Your Holy Spirit to
inspire and give us wisdom so that we may know Your presence with us.  We join
the choirs of angels and archangels as we lift up this prayer of praise to You
in the name of Your Son Jesus, our Savior, Who is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorials of Saint Jerome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Tuesday of Twenty-sixth Week in Ordinary
Time)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from:

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Jerome:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-jerome</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Zechariah 8: 20-23;        Psalm 87: 1b-3, 4-5
6-7;         Luke 9: 51-56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD establishes a relationship with the chosen people and
through them many others are brought into a closer union with GOD.  The First
Reading describes how people of various nations will be drawn to the LORD GOD
by association with the Jewish believers.  The Responsorial echoes the First
Reading in mentioning that various countries and their people will come to the
LORD GOD in Jerusalem.  In the Gospel, Jesus turns His thoughts, attention, and
direction toward Jerusalem and in the process comes across the Samaritans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Zechariah addresses the Babylonian exiles who
have returned to Jerusalem.  Not only have they been privileged to return to
the Holy City and rebuild the Temple, but many other peoples from various nations
will also come to worship the LORD GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reiterates the message of Zechariah.  The people
coming from various countries are primarily the Jews who have been spread
throughout the world and who can now come back to the newly restored Temple and
city of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus leaves Galilee after having begun and
ended His ministry in that area.  As He journeys toward the climax of His
mission in Jerusalem, He travels the shortest way from Galilee to Judea which
takes Him into Samaria where He and His disciples are met with opposition due
to the fact that they are Jews heading toward the Jewish Temple in the city of
Jerusalem.  The disciples want Jesus to punish those who are not open to their
proclamation of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel and their passage through Samaria.  Jesus challenges
the disciple on their narrow mindedness and their hurt feelings because they
have been rejected by the Samaritans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As disciples of the Lord Jesus, we are to proclaim the GOoD
News of Jesus Christ at all times.  We sometimes meet with great acceptance and
from people of various backgrounds who eagerly accept the message of Jesus as
we share it in word and action.  At other times, we get only a cold shoulder,
or worse, from the people with whom we seek to share the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting on the readings, leads me to the realization that
at times, I have been like the disciples of Jesus in being upset when the
message I have preached is met with opposition.  I sometimes fail to realize
that GOD’s ha a plan for all people.  The divine plan is that all are called to
come to a closer relationship with GOD the Abba- Father and the Lord Jesus in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, even if it does not follow my time-line and my
model.  I sometime have taken it personally when I have been rebuffed by
others, and I have forgotten what Jesus says in Luke 10: 16 – “Whoever rejects
you, rejects Me and the One Who sent Me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our role as evangelists – “messengers of GOoD News” – needs
to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>strike a balance between our efforts and GOD’s action.  Yes,
we must do the best job we possibly can in proclaiming the Gospel, especially
in our actions.  Yet, we also need to realize that GOD’s timing and GOD’s
giving of the gift of faith is beyond our control, and beyond our experience of
people’s free will in rejecting the GOoD News.  Just as a skilled physician
must uses the best surgical tools, so GOD can use us when we are the best
tools.  We are instruments in GOD’s hands.  We have to be the best instruments,
but GOD is the One Who will perform the ultimate procedure that will cause the
desired effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD wants people from every land and nations, every
background and experience to come to accept the gift of salvation offered and
made possible through Jesus and His saving ministry.  GOD desires the salvation
of all souls more than we ever desire it or imagine it.  GOD has allowed us to
be instruments in the divine hands, who share what we have received with
others.  Yet the ultimate decision to respond is not ours.  We must go to the
places and people as we are directed by the Lord Jesus.  What is important is
that we keep our eyes focused on our Master-Teacher, the Divine Physician, with
Whom we are journeying.  He is the One Who knows where we should be heading. 
We must pray that we hear the words from the First Reading as we follow our
Master- Teacher, the same words that others will hopefully say to us:  “Let us
go with you, for we have heard that GOD is with you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I sense my call
to be instruments of GOoD News in the hands of GOD?  W hat can I do to be a better
tool in the proclamation of the Gospel? Do I rejoice when GOD calls people of
various backgrounds to receive the GOoD News? To whom might the Lord Jesus be
sending me today and how can I be instrumental in sharing the message of the
Lord Jesus with them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all peoples and places. 
Through Your GOoDness, we have been privileged to not only travel with Your
Son, Jesus, but also to be sent out by Him to announce the GOoD News by our
actions and words.  Sometimes we have taken our privileged role and mission too
seriously and have tried to direct You to work with us rather than following
the lead of Your Son and do what You would have us do. Continue to forgive us
and empower us by Your Holy Spirit.  May our eyes always be focused on Your
Son, Jesus, our Master- Teacher and Guide as we journey along with Him to our
ultimate destination, Your presence in the Heavenly Temple of Your glory. 
Continue to form us into the useful instruments of the Gospel.  We make this
prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who has died, is risen,
and now is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-therese-of-lisieux</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Nehemiah 2: 1-8;        Psalm 137: 1-2, 3, 4-5,
6;        Luke 9: 57-62</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a follower of GOD takes a lot of fortitude.  Nehemiah,
a Jew and court official of Artaxerxes (king of Persia and grandson of Darius
I), is willing to risk his life in order to further the rebuilding of the
Temple in Jerusalem and the strengthening of the faith of his people.  The
psalm is the prayer of the exiles in Babylonian who seek to remember the
importance of Jerusalem and the faith relationship with GOD.  In the Gospel,
Jesus will not accept any excuse for delaying in becoming His disciple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the Persians conquered the Babylonians and released
most of the Jews from their exile, some remained in Babylon as the new empire
was established.  Nehemiah, a Jewish lay person, served King Artaxerxes as
cup-bearer, an important office in the royal court. Nehemiah was obviously
trusted by the king, for he was permitted to be in the queen’s presence. 
Nehemiah turned to GOD in prayer so that he would say the correct words and
that King Artaxerxes would be open</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to GOD’s plan to rebuild Jerusalem.  Nehemiah risks his
position and his life in asking Artaxerxes not only for permission to return to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jerusalem to help rebuild the city and the Temple, but also
for financial help in the process.  GOD obviously blessed Nehemiah and moved
the king to agree to Nehemiah’s requests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm recalls the lament of the Babylonian exiles as
they reflect on their past life in Jerusalem and the holiness of the Temple. 
Even though their captors (the Babylonians) request them to sing the joyous
songs that they had heard the Jews sing in Jerusalem, they refuse to do so
because they are mourning their absence from the Holy Place of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, a few individuals declare their desire to
follow Jesus, but first request time to take care of family business and saying
their “good- byes” to their loved ones.  Jesus demands an immediate leaving
behind of their former lives if they are to be His disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings, especially the Gospel, seems quite harsh. 
They are meant to stress the complete commitment one must make to being a
disciple of Jesus.  One must risk all and forsake all, if one is to follow the
Lord Jesus. In some sense, GOD will not take any excuses that delay a complete
dedication to being in the service of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings and the commitment that the
Lord Jesus is asking of me, I realize how often I have made unjustifiable
excuses in delaying my total committal to being His disciple.  I have made my
relationship to my family or to my job take a higher priority than my
willingness to do GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe Jesus is not saying that we should forget about
our family or our obligations to our work, but that spreading the GOoD News of
GOD must be the first and foremost thought in our minds.  If we truly seek to
be disciples of Jesus and follow Him, then we will be even better members of
our family and more valuable employees at our places of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know that there have been times when I have not spoken up
about my faith</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because I did not want to be a source of contention to
family members.  I placed the value of “family peace” over that of the Gospel
value of proclaiming the GOoD News. Yet, in the long run, if I would
“evangelize” other </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>family members, the true Peace of Christ would be present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a follow of the Lord Jesus is challenging, to say the
least.  It demands that we think about what GOD is calling us to do in each and
every situation. Our first priority must always be being faithful to GOD.  If
we can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>put GOD first, everything else will fit into place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s psalm speaks about remembering Jerusalem.  Jerusalem
is much more than a city.  Jerusalem (“City of Peace”) stands for the
relationship one has with GOD.  Thus, we could appropriately paraphrase the
psalm today and say:  “If I forget You, O GOD, may my right hand be forgotten! 
May my tongue cleave to my palate if I remember You not, if I place not Your
will ahead of my joy.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What excuses have I
made when I have been challenged to put GOD’s work and GOD’s will first in my
life?  How do I balance my commitment to family and work with my living out my
faith relationship with the Lord Jesus? What is the most difficult aspect of
living out this balance?  How can I support others in their building up the
dwelling place for GOD in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all.  Through Your GOoDness we
are called to be disciples of Your Son. Following Him demands that we never
forget Him and You, His Abba-Father, while we do our normal routine. Your
mission for us is to place Your will ahead of our own joy.  For the times we
have had our priorities wrong and put Gospel values in a lower position, we
seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  We thank You for sending us Your Son as our
Master-Teacher Who always placed His relationship with You as the first
priority in His earthly life.  That commitment to You flowed into His ministry
to all with whom He came in contact.  By the inspiration and strength of Your
Holy Spirit, help us to follow Jesus and His example, without making excuses or
rationalizing our behavior.  May we constantly lift up to You our praise and
thanksgiving, our loyalty and devotion.  We make this prayer in the name of
Jesus, Your Son, and our Brother, the Master-Teacher Who calls us to follow
Him, as He leads us to be with Himself, You, and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Guardian Angels: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/feast-of-the-guardian-angels</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Nehemiah 8: 1-4a, 5-6, 7b-12;        Psalm 19: 8,
9, 10, 11;       Luke 10: 1-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sharing the Word of GOD should bring joy and a sense of
fulfillment that no earthly rewards can match. Today’s First Reading describes
how the “hidden” Book of the Law was read to the recently returned exiles. As
the Book of the Law is proclaimed, the people originally feel fearful, but
later joyous. Our psalm reminds us that GOD’s law is one means through which
GOD communicates the divine message to us and that should be a source of
fulfillment and joy. Since today is the Memorial of the Guardian Angels, the
Gospel is not that of Thursday of the Twenty-sixth Week, but the Gospel for
this special day when we reflect on Guardian Angels. In today’s Gospel, Jesus
places a young child in the midst of His disciples and tells them they must
have the faith of a child and that they should be careful how they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>treat children for they have angels in heaven who are in
touch with GOD. Although it may seem impossible that we all have Guardian
Angels, this is part of GOD’s plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to earlier chapters in the book of Nehemiah, while
the Temple in Jerusalem was being restored, a lost (at least one not seen
before in their lifetime) copy of the Law of the LORD was found. At the
re-dedication of the Temple, the Book of the Law (Deuteronomy? - “second law”)
was read to the assembled people. At first,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they were saddened because they and their ancestors had not
been as faithful to the Law as they could have been. Nehemiah and Ezra
encourage the people to rejoice because their being joyful that GOD
communicated with the people should be the source of strength for doing GOD’s
will in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm recounts how</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>knowing and keeping GOD’s law brings positive effects. The
message of GOD’s law produces refreshment for the soul, trustworthiness,
wisdom, joy, insight, purity, and truth. Accepting what GOD wants us to do can
be worth more than material wealth or sweetness in our mouths.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus shows not only His own love and care
for children, but also the concern His Abba-Father has for all humans. Jesus
first tells the arguing disciples that they are focusing on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wrong thing. They should not be concerned about who is the
greatest but should simply have the faith of a child. Jesus also reminds His
disciples of the importance of not causing any hurt or confusion to children
because their angels are in the presence of GOD; and therefore, part of GOD’s
providential care is our having Guardian Angels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems like in the last decades that angels have been the
focus of interest by many people. I used to watch the TNT program Saving Grace
with an angel named Earl who came to work with an Oklahoma police officer named
Grace. Earl is seen as a middle age, slightly overweight man who is not only
sent to assist the drinking, cussing, sexually active detective (played by
Holly Hunter) but also to many other people throughout</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the world include an African-American inmate in jail who is
on death row. A few years later, Roma Downey show, Answered Prayers, showed
different individuals appearing at key moments of a person’s life in response
to the prayer of the individual going through difficulty. These responders to
prayer, although looking like human, are considered “messengers” sent by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To understand the role of angels, we must look at the
meaning of the word “angel” and how the concept is used in scripture. The
English word “angel” comes from the Greek word</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>angelos (αγγελος) which means “messenger.” Scripture
frequently mentions angels as messengers from GOD. In some accounts instead of
GOD speaking directly to mortals, GOD uses angels as intermediaries. The role
of the angels is to demonstrate GOD’s love for the people, and to lead them in
developing a relationship with GOD and to guide them on the path </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>toward GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on angels, I am touched by how much GOD loves
me. GOD is willing to do whatever it takes to establish a relationship with me
and to bring me safely into the divine presence, not to a spectacular physical
building, but in a personal relationship. GOD can use “messengers” who might be
purely spiritual beings. At other times GOD has other human beings involved as
divine “messengers.” The key thing is that GOD wants me to get the “message.”
The message is that GOD cares for me and will use all means to remind me of how
much the Lord Jesus wants to protect me, save me, and lead me to the heavenly
home, all for the greater glory of GOD’s name.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Going further back in history, I was touched by the former
Roma Downey broadcast show, Touch by an Angel. What impressed me was the
message of the “angels.” They were not out to “control” people, but simply to
bring individuals the reassuring words, “GOD loves you.” I have met many such
“messengers” in my lifetime. Some may have been non-human creatures, I’m not
sure. But when I needed GOD’s reassurance in my life, especially in response to
my prayer to GOD, frequently there was someone there who spoke the words I need
to hear: “GOD loves you.” Do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe that there are guardian (or guarding) angels? Yes.
I believe GOD will use all means and creatures to get the message through to
me. Do I have a personal guarding angel? I think GOD loves me enough to provide
one for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The focus always has to be on the One Who sends the message,
not on the messenger. GOD is the One Who sends the messenger with the divine
message. If our focus strays from the source of the message to the messenger,
we are missing the point. Yes, it is great to be “Touched by an Angel.” And it
is true that GOD sends the message of “Saving Grace.” But what is greater is
that GOD wants me to be touched by the divine hand stretched out by
intermediaries,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and GOD has already provided “Saving Grace” in and through
the death and resurrection of Jesus. GOD loves me enough to answer my prayers,
often in ways I could never imagine. GOD desires that I am experiencing the
loving, divine touch. For that I can only thank and praise GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my opinion
on angels? Have I experienced beings (human or otherwise) who have announced GOD’s
message to me?  How have I responded to the message of GOD’s love for me? Can I
bless the name of the Lord even when I experience losses in my life? Do I sense
the presence of the love of GOD for me during those trying times?   How can I
reach out to others who need to be reminded of GOD’s love?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all who bring Your message to
others. Through Your GOoDness, we have been touched by Your divine hand
stretched out to us, sometimes through Your messengers (angels). Sometimes we
get so wrapped up in ourselves that we miss Your touch and fail to listen to
You speaking to us. Particularly when we get weighed down by the pressure of
what seems to be an impossible life, we don’t focus on Your presence with us.
Because of Your great love for us, You send us “messengers” to speak Your
“message” to us. The greatest “Messenger” of Your love was Your Son, Jesus.
Yet, You do not limit Yourself to speaking to us only through the ministry of
Jesus, but You choose to send creatures (human and non-human) in order to
remind us of the Message of You and Your Son and Your Saving Grace. We thank
You and praise You for Your never-ending persistence in trying to get the
message through our thick heads. You manifest Your love for us, especially when
You answer our prayers, in ways that truly amaze us. May we realize how You
have touched and continue to touch our lives. We make this prayer to praise the
glory of Your name, all in the name of the same Jesus, Your Son and Our
Brother. He it is Who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the One Who is Saving Grace and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Theodora Guerin:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-theodora-guerin</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Baruch 1: 15-22;               Psalm 79: 1b-2,
3-5, 8, 9;                 Luke 10: 13-16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words of the Responsorial Psalm summarize the readings
today:  “Deliver us and pardon our sins, for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your sake, O LORD.”  The prophet Baruch shares the feelings
of the Babylonian exiles while they were away</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from the Promised Land.  Sorrow for past sins was the cry of
the exiles.  The psalm also reflects the sentiments of the exiles as they
realize how much they were in need of forgiveness and deliverance by GOD.  The
Gospel is an admonition to the unbelievers and sinners in Galilee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many Biblical scholars believe that the words of the Book of
Baruch were written after the Babylonian exile and the words reflect the
reaction of the people during the exile.  Today’s passage expresses how the
people felt during the exile.  They pray to GOD with remorse for their sinfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is also a prayer asking GOD to save the people
from the suffering that they are experiencing. They invoke GOD as their
savior.  One key aspect of the psalm/prayer is the reason why they seek GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness.  It is not for their own sake, but for GOD’s
sake that they ask GOD to redeem them.  For in forgiving, GOD demonstrates the
compassion for which GOD is known and for which all people will praise and
glorify GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During Jesus’ ministry to people living in Galilee, He met a
certain amount of rejection and disbelief.  In the Gospel today, Jesus condemns
the lack of faith of the people in spite of the fact that Jesus has performed
great signs in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their midst.  He comments that the known sinful people of
old would have turned their lives around if they had seen and heard all that
Jesus was doing and saying.  The pericope ends with Jesus reminding His
disciples that when they proclaim the GOoD News and are met with rejection, the
rejection is not just of the disciples and their message, but of Jesus and His
Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the Catholic school where a relative taught a few years</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ago, each month one of the classes was responsible for the
First Friday liturgy celebrated with the whole school in attendance.  A couple
of years ago these readings were the ones for this day.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>was the turn of my relative’s class.  As they were preparing
for the celebration and reading over the readings, they found the assigned
reading quite difficult and negative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is never easy to be reminded that we fall short of what
GOD expects of us.  We all “miss the mark” (the translation of one of the
scripture words for “sin”).  We are all in need of GOD’s forgiveness.  Part of
what it means to be a true believer in GOD is to realize Who GOD is and who we
are in GOD’s sight.  We are sinners in need of forgiveness.  GOD is the Perfect
One Who deserves more than our sinfulness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are in need of deliverance and pardon.  As mere humans,
we can never satisfy the wrong that we have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>done by any of our own deeds.  The One Who has been rejected
by our sinfulness is divine and therefore the Only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One Who can bring about a restoration of the relationship
with GOD is One Who is also divine, that is GOD. Yet, since those who have
sinned are human, so the One Who heals the broken relationship must also be
human. It is thus that the true Redeemer and Savior of the world’s sinfulness
has to be both human and divine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is the Savior of all.  He has come to bring the
message of GOD’s forgiveness to us not only by His </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>words and ministry, but especially by His own suffering,
death, and resurrection.  The only thing we can do is accept the gift of salus
(healing, forgiveness, wholeness, salvation) that was given through Jesus’
saving acts. Part of accepting the gift of salus includes acknowledging our
need for being saved and seeking forgiveness. Jesus was mostly upset with the
unbelievers of His day because they would not acknowledge their need of His
gift of salvation.  Even though His offer of salvation was rejected, Jesus
still did what was necessary to redeem even the unbelievers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A while ago I received an email that I have included after
the prayer and Song for the Day and Video for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Day.  It is called “Donuts.”  It is an allegory.  And as
with all allegories, this one is not perfect, but it is helpful. It reminds us
that Jesus has done whatever is necessary to save every person, even if a
person does not ask for the gift or accept the gift that Jesus offers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We need to be reminded of our need for GOD and the gift of
salus that has come through Jesus.  We must continue to seek GOD’s forgiveness
and deliverance, not just for our own sake, but for the reason of giving all
the glory and honor GOD deserves for being the saving, redeeming, loving GOD
that GOD is.  Let us join with the psalmist today and say:  “Help us, O GOD our
Savior, because of the glory of Your name; Deliver us and pardon our sins for
Your name’s sake.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think about
what is being offered to me in and through Jesus and His life, death, and
resurrection, what comes to mind?  As I ponder my “missing the mark” (sinning)
and the price Jesus paid to restore me to rightful relations with His Abba, how
do I respond?  How can I help others accept the gift of salvation that Jesus has
gained for us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all forgiveness and
deliverance.  Through Your GOoDness we have been offered the gift of Your
salus.  We have not always been mindful of the salvation and pardon You offer
us.  We thank You for allowing Your Son, Jesus, to share our humanity and make
the ultimate sacrifice of Himself in order to re-establish the relationship You
desire us to have with You.  Through the continued outpouring of Your Holy
Spirit, help us to be conscious of our need to seek Your deliverance.  May we
always give You all the glory and praise that is due to You.  We make this
prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and Redeemer,
Who has suffered, died, and is risen, and Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Baruch 4: 5-12, 27-29;        Psalm 69: 33-35,
36-37;          Luke 10: 17-24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings are a source of hope for those who turn to the
LORD GOD.  Baruch reminds those who are in exile that GOD will restore them to
their land and give them hope.  The Responsorial Psalm promises GOoD things to
those who seek the LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus reassures His faithful disciples
that not only will they see great things happen because of their willingness to
minister in His name, but also, they will experience the fullness of the Truth
as He reveals it to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baruch uses the experiences of the Babylonian exile as a
reminder that GOD will restore those who are faithful to the relationship that
they had been offered before the exile.  The mourning and sadness they have
undergone will be turned into joy and happiness as GOD brings back the
repentant sinners.  Their time of being physically away from the Temple (the
House of GOD) has been symbolic of what sin does in the spiritual realm.  Sin
isolates the sinner from GOD.  The contrite sinners will be able to once again
come back into GOD’s presence (be reconciled) because of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s compassion and forgiveness, just as the exiles will be
led back to the Promise Land and rebuild the Temple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm reminds us that GOD promises a full
renewal of the divine relationship to those who are humble enough to seek GOD’s
pardon.  Acknowledging that one needs GOD’s help is the first step to GOD’s
turning things around and establishing the covenant promises that the LORD has
made throughout history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the seventy-two disciples return from their
missionary experiences.  They are excited about the signs that were worked
during their apostolic endeavors.  Jesus tells them to keep their focus in the
right place.  The key</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>point is not the miraculous happenings that have occurred
during</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their ministry, but that they are in relationship with Jesus
and His Abba-Father and that they are doing GOD’s will.  Jesus calls His
disciples aside for prayer and reflection.  He lifts up a prayer of praise to
His Abba, expressing His gratitude that His Abba is empowering His disciples
with wisdom, knowledge, and a relationship that others have not been privileged
to experience because they have not lived at the time of Jesus or they have not
accepted what has been offered to them, in and through Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that GOD desires to
share the fullness of the divine gifts with people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who are open to GOD’s self-revealing blessings will
receive them.  But there are blocks that we put in the way of GOD’s dispensing
of the gifts.  Our sinful actions and thoughts prevent, or at least hinder, the
flow of GOD’s graces.  It is only when we humble acknowledge our “missing the
mark” (sin) that GOD can put us back </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on target and restore the process of GOD’s abundant gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is true that we cannot earn, nor can we do anything, to
deserve GOD’s graciousness.  Yet GOD desires to lavishly pour out divine gifts
upon us.  All we need do is to open ourselves to GOD’s gifts as the Lord Jesus
extends them to us.  We can, however, put obstacles in the way of GOD’s action. 
Whenever we seek other values than the Gospel (GOoD News) values that Jesus
shared with us, we limit our ability to receive GOD’s presents/presence (gifts
and being aware GOD is with us).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being a true disciple of Jesus means going out in His name and
proclaiming the GOoD News.  When we are willing to share the ever-deepening
relationship that we have with the Lord Jesus, He empowers us with more
insights into the Truth of GOD.  In turn, great things – miraculous things –
can happen, not because of our actions, but because we are open to GOD’s
working in our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let us focus in on Jesus’ prayer at the end of today’s
Gospel, realizing that He is praying for us, that we would be in an even closer
relationship with Him and His Abba in union with the Holy Spirit, as He says: 
“Yes, Abba, such has been Your gracious will.  All things have been handed over
to Me by [You,] My Abba.  No one knows Who the Son is except [You,] Abba, and
no one knows Who You are, Abba, except the Son and anyone to whom the Son
wishes to reveal [You,] Abba.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What obstacles
have I put up to hinder or impede GOD’s gracious presents (presence) in my
life? How have I experienced the flow of GOD’s graces in my life when I have
been open to what the Lord Jesus pours forth? What can I do to help others
experience the flow of GOD’s graciousness into their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all graces and blessings. 
Through Your GOoDness You bestow abundant gifts upon those who are open to Your
presents (presence).  At times we have thrown up hurdles and blockades to the
free flow of Your generosity.  Humbly and penitentially, we seek that You break
through the hindrances we have put up in our lives by our own sinfulness. 
Helps us to be faithful disciples of Your Son and to share in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His ministry by serving those whom He has entrusted to our
care.  We lift up to You this prayer of gratitude and praise, as we invoke the
name of Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Brother, the Master-Teacher Who has
taught us by His example, and redeemed us through His suffering, death, and
resurrection, and Who is now living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Habakkuk 1: 2-3; 2: 2-4;    Psalm 95: 1-2, 6-7,
8-9;     2 Timothy 1: 6-8, 13-14;     Luke 17: 5-10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being faithful is not always easy, but it is our duty as
disciples of the Lord Jesus.  Habakkuk, the prophet in the First Reading,
begins his book by questioning GOD concerning the impending Babylonian forces
threatening the kingdom of Judah.  GOD responds by telling Habakkuk to
faithfully await the coming of GOD’s saving plan. The Responsorial challenges
the people to faithfully listen to GOD’s voice and not harden their hearts. 
St. Paul, in his Second Letter to Timothy, urges the young leader to remain
faithful to the calling that was signed forth (symbolized - “sacramentalized”)
by Paul’s imposition of hands on Timothy.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about
the power of one who is faithful and the calling of faithful servant to do what
is expected and not to expect rewards for doing what is asked or what is
required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Habakkuk lives and preaches just before Nebuchadnezzar's
invasion of the southern kingdom of Judah.  He senses the foreboding disaster. 
He asks GOD why GOD would allow such happenings to befall the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In response, GOD instructs the prophet to clearly announce
and make known the impending event.  Though terrible things would be happening
soon, GOD will ultimately be faithful to the divine promises made long ago and
GOD will bring about salvation, even though those who are faithful to GOD will
have to patiently await for, and experience suffering until, the fulfillment of
the promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist today chides the faithful to listen to GOD’s
message and be more faithful than their ancestors who heard GOD’s voice and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hardened their hearts to GOD’s message.  Those who respond
to GOD’s Word, even though it may be challenging, will bow down in worship
rather than test GOD by turning away from the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a second letter to his faithful protégé, St. Paul urges
Timothy to recall the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rite of ordination when Paul imposed his hands on the
younger man who was going to assume the role of overseeing (ἐπισκοποντος –
episkopontos – “bishoping”) the faithful in Ephesus.  Paul reminds Timothy that
it was GOD’s calling of Timothy to be a servant-leader of the faith community
and GOD is the One Who gives the Spirit of empowerment and will see Timothy
through as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>long as Timothy remains faithful to his calling from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, in response to the disciples’ request for a
deepening of faith, Jesus counsels His disciples that as their faith deepens,
they will see great things happen.   Jesus goes on to remind them that they are
called to be faithful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>servant-leaders who do the will of their Master.  They
should not think that they will be rewarded just for doing their duty, for it
is just that, their duty as servants of their Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I go back to a common theme I
see in scriptures:  being a faithful servant-leader. All who become disciples
of the Master are called to be of service to others.  It is our duty to listen
to GOD’s voice and respond faithfully.  The call to be a servant-leader is not
just for those who are ordained as deacons, priests, or bishops, or recognized
as other ministers, but it is a call for all who are baptized in the Lord
Jesus. Once we accept the gifts that are symbolized (“sacramentalized”) by our
baptism, we commit ourselves to being faithful disciples of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of being faithful disciples includes doing the ministry
or service that GOD assigns us.  Like Timothy, we are called to bear the
hardships that come with this vocation.  We are to serve those whom GOD commits
to our </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>care.  We may wonder when we will be rewarded for our
faithful service.  Jesus, in the Gospel, calls us to refocus our attention. 
Just because we do what we are expected to do – serving others and announcing
to them the GOoD News of salvation – we are not going to be welcomed into the
Reign of GOD and be waited on by GOD. Yes, GOD will lavishly bless us and will
give, and presently gives, us gifts beyond our imagination, but it is not
because we are dutiful and faithful servants.  It is because the LORD is a
faithful GOD Who has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promised to pour out abundant riches and life upon those who
respond to the divine call.  Our being faithful should flow from a realization
of GOD’s GOoDness to us, not GOD’s GOoDness being the result of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our being faithful.  We should want to do all that is
expected of us, not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because we anxiously look forward to what we will receive
from GOD, but in thanksgiving for what Lord Jesus has already given us – a
closer relationship with GOD.  Yes, it is true that GOD will continue to gift
us, but we should be willing to minister and serve others and proclaim the GOoD
News because of that with which we have already been blessed.  Our calling
(vocation) is to live out the fact that we have been invited into a
relationship with a GOD Who loves us, cares for us, and has already blessed us
with the greatest gift of all – Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to call people to be faithful disciples who
will announce the GOoD News by their loving service of others and their
grateful praise and giving thanks to GOD.  GOD is still addressing people with
the divine Word.  “Oh, that today you would hear GOD’s voice!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of the
fact that I am being called by GOD to service (ministry), how do I react?  Do I
feel burdened by the amount of work that is being expected of me? Do I think
about the benefits that I will receive when I finish my work? Or do I respond
obediently and faithfully, being conscious of all that GOD has already done for
me? In what way(s) am I being called to service (ministry)? What gifts has GOD
already given me and what gifts am I expected to use in my proclaiming the GOoD
News to others? How can I affirm the ministry (service) that other people are
doing and reassure them that they are responding to all the GOD has given them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, divine giver of gifts and caller
of those who will share in the vocation of announcing Your GOoD News.  Through
Your GOoDness, You continue to lavishly pour out Your blessings upon people,
expecting them to respond by faithfully sharing what they have received with
others, through their loving service of those who have been entrusted to their
care and by their proclamation of Your Word.  At times we have heard Your voice
calling us and we have hardened our hearts and turned away from what You ask of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us, choosing to pursue our own interests, rather than
faithfully serving You by ministering to Your people.  For the hardness of our
hearts, we seek forgiveness and Your healing touch so that our hearts may
become loving and soft as we do what You ask of us.  Continue to send us Your
Holy Spirit with the gifts of power, love, and self-control that we need in
order to do our duty as Your faithful servants.  May we always give our praise
and thanks to You for what You have done for us, especially in and through the
life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Your Son.  It is in His name – Jesus
– that we make this prayer for He is our Master-Teacher, Lord and Savior, and
He has died for us, is risen, and is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.   Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-bruno Readings: Jonah
1:1––2:1-2, 11;          Jonah 2: 3, 4, 5, 8;            Luke 10: 25-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Human ways and attitudes do not always fall in line with
GOD’s ways and the divine will. Today’s First Reading and Responsorial relate the
beginning of the story of Jonah. Jonah tries to flee from doing GOD’s will and
ends up in stormy waters and in the belly of a marine animal, yet he prays, and
GOD hears his prayer. The Gospel presents the account of the “GOoD Samaritan”
who is the one who truly cares for his neighbor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story of Jonah is familiar to most of us. Reading it
carefully helps us to understand GOD better. Jonah is asked to preach a message
to the people of Nineveh - a “heathen” city to the northeast of the Holy Land.
If this book was written after the Exile, as many scripture scholars believe,
it would be hard for most Jews to believe that GOD would want a Jewish prophet
to go to Nineveh, a town near Babylon, and announce a message of the need of
repentance to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people in the area where the Exile took place. And even more
dramatic response from the Jewish people would have followed the last part of
the story that we will hear over the next few days. The sentiments of Jonah
trying to avoid such a mission would have been very</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understandable to the formerly exiled people. Thus, Jonah
sails on a ship to Tarshish (to the west). GOD would use a stormy sea to get
Jonah’s attention and make him repent and do an about-face. This is a sign of
GOD’s desire that the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people have a true metanoia - change of mindset or turning
about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jonah’s prayer (part of which forms the Responsorial today)
is a penitential one, admitting his guilt and asking for GOD’s forgiveness. GOD
rescues Jonah and forgives him, just as GOD is willing to “rescue”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and forgive any who turns away from their sinfulness and
seeks to turn back to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today has some similarities to other passages
from the other Gospel writers, but it carries a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>slightly different ending. A scribe acknowledges Jesus as a
rabbi (teacher) and asks Him what he must do to have eternal life. Jesus asks
the scribe a question about what is the greatest command. The scribe responds
by summarizing all the laws into the two commandments of loving GOD with one’s
whole being and loving one’s neighbor as one’s self. Jesus affirms the answer.
The scribe questions further, “Who is my neighbor?” Jesus responds with the
parable of the GOoD Samaritan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus relates the story of the Jewish man who encounters
robbers on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho, the crowd would have expected
the neighborly person to be one of the men of honor who are mentioned – the
priest or the Levite. For whatever reason, both not only refuse to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help, but also, they visibly avoid getting near the beaten
man by walking</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the other side of the road. The one who turns out to be
“neighborly” is the religious enemy of the Jews, a Samaritan. Not only does the
Samaritan supply first aid, but also, he takes the man to one of the inns that
were located along the often traveled road and puts up the injured man for the
night and provides money so that the inn-keeper will continue to care for the
attacked man. The Samaritan even promises to reimburse the inn-keeper for any
further costs should it become necessary. In His typical fashion, Jesus asks
the scribe to answer the question that was put to Him, “Who is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the neighbor?” The scribe can only answer, “the one who took
pity on the man.” Jesus concludes the passage, “Go and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>do likewise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doing GOD’s will does not always appeal to us. It demands a
lot from us. Jonah found that out. When he was first told to perform his
prophetic mission to the Ninevites, he tried to get out of it. Some of the
prophets would begin to bargain with GOD or to present excuses to avoid doing
what GOD wanted them to do. Jonah just flees in the opposite direction (heading
west on the sea rather than east on the desert roads). GOD does not like to
take “No” as a answer to the divine plan, particularly when GOD has revealed
exactly what a person is asked to do. GOD has ways of getting</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the attention of those who diametrically oppose the divine
will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar way, people often interpret GOD’s Word in ways
that fit into their own plans. The scribe has been faithful in “keeping” the
two commandments, at least as far as he thinks. He has loved GOD and loved his
neighbors, who are, in his opinion, his family and friends. Never would he have
thought of a Samaritan as a person who could be understood to be a neighbor.
How could one’s adversary be a person who should be loved, and loved as much as
one loves oneself?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often we are like both Jonah and the scribe. We are
willing to do GOD’s will as long as it fits into our understanding and our
plans. When we sense that we might be asked to do something that is against our
liking or against our gut feelings, we will make excuses, or walk around the
issue, or head in the opposite direction. Sometimes GOD will get our attention
by making us face that which we are trying to avoid. I recall when I knew I had
to work on being more patient, some of the most challenging annoyances came my
way to make me have to deal with my being patient.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is some GOoD News (as is par for the readings): GOD is
willing not only to remind us what we are to do, but also the LORD GOD is
willing to forgive us for turning away from what GOD has asked of us. If we cry
out to GOD, as did Jonah, from the depths of our sinfulness, GOD will hear our
prayer, forgive us, and give us the opportunity to do the divine will with even
more “enthusiasm” (having “GOD within” or “in GOD”) than before. Let us take a
GOoD look at our attitudes toward what GOD may be asking of us. Let us realize
that we have sometimes avoided doing what GOD has planned for our lives. Then
from the pit or deep spot in which we have sunk, let us cry out to GOD, as did
Jonah, and pray the Responsorial, “You will rescue me from the pit, O LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Have I ever
responded to GOD’s plan by turning away or by purposely limiting my
understanding of what might be asking of me?  Was I challenged to face my
failure to do GOD’s will?   What was the final result of such an experience?
Did it lead to a better understanding of what GOD was asking of me? How can I
be a source of helping others come to know GOD’s presence in their lives and
strengthen them to respond more fully to GOD’s call?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all plans. Through Your
GOoDness You have included us in those plans and have desired that we play a
part in bringing Your GOoD News to others. Yet, like Jonah and the scribe
today, we have sometimes interpreted Your call and Your Word in our own ways or
have even avoided Your request all together, walking around the issue or
high-tailing it in the opposite direction. For the times we have not been faithful
to what You have asked of us, we cry out from our sinful depths and ask that
You would lift us up with Your mercy. Help us to realize that You desire that
we not only love You with our whole selves (our heart, being, strength, and
mind), but that we are to extend Your love to those whose paths we cross even
if they seem to be our worst enemies. Through the example of Your Son and the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, continue to strength us to do Your will. We
thank Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for Your mercy and compassion, Your patience and love. We
lift this prayer to You in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother, Savior and
Master-Teacher, Who has died, is risen, and now is living and reigning with You
and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Jonah 3:1-10;        Psalm 130: 1b-2: 3-4ab,
7-8;          Luke 10: 38-42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes it is necessary to stop our regular routine and be
attentive to GOD and wait on GOD. In the First Reading, we hear that at the
preaching of Jonah, the Ninevites turned from their regular (and sinful)
routines, and they waited on the mercy of the LORD. The psalm is the prayer of
one who has been down in the pits and knows that by crying out to the LORD and
waiting for GOD to respond, one will see the forgiveness and love of GOD
demonstrated. Today’s Gospel relates the story of Mary and Martha, with Martha
being seen “waiting on the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus” as the action of serving Him, while Mary understands
“waiting on the Lord Jesus” means sitting patiently and waiting for Jesus to
speak words of wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Jonah’s experience at sea and in the belly of the
marine creature, he decides to do what GOD has commanded him to do – go to the
pagan and sinful city of Nineveh and proclaim a message of destruction because
of the wayward actions of the people. After just traveling through less than a
third of the city, the people (including the king) who have heard of Jonah’s
announcement (either directly or indirectly) decide that maybe if they practice
the traditional acts of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>penance (fasting, wearing sackcloth and sitting in ashes),
GOD might relent of the punishment that was planned for them and their city.
All the people begin a fast and a period of penance while they wait to see if
GOD will destroy them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist today prays that GOD will listen to his cry as
he calls out from the depths of his misery. There is an acknowledgment that the
sins that have been committed do not merit any sort of forgiveness. Yet, the
hope expressed is that if one should repent and wait, then GOD will respond
with mercy, saving those who deserve to be punishment from the full force of
the divine wrath.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus enters the home of Mary and Martha.
Both women are excited to have the Master visit them. Martha believes that she
must “wait on the Lord Jesus” by preparing a meal and being the hostess with
the most-est. She busies herself with doing the proper things necessary to show
hospitality to such great a guest. Mary, on the other hand, wants to wait on
every word that comes from the mouth of the Great Teacher. She sits at His
feet, listening intently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings speak about “waiting on the Lord.” GOD is
willing to act, but not always according to the timetable on which humans
expect GOD to act. Sometimes “waiting on the Lord” means we must be actively
involved in carrying on our duties, serving others as a way we serve the Lord.
At other times, we must be willing to sit patiently and see what GOD will do,
and listen for a message that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>may come directly or indirectly from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The two ways we can “wait on the Lord” are by being active
and by being reflective. Both are necessary at certain, but different, times.
Rather than being contradictory they are very much complimentary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being active is not just doing things. It is doing the right
things. The Ninevites had been active, but in the wrong way. They had done the
wrong things – they had sinned. Jonah was sent to challenge the wrong
activities of the Ninevites. If they continued in the wrong behavior, GOD was
going to destroy them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Activity that “waits on the Lord” is doing what is expected
of a person at this point in her/his life, while being willing to acknowledge
that one has not always done the right thing. It would include “waiting on others”
as a true servant (just as Martha did). It means being a true waiter or
waitress, and meeting the authentic needs of the people with whom one comes in
contact. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other type of “waiting on the Lord” includes listening
and reflecting on what the Lord Jesus might be communicating. This type of
“waiting” is what Mary did as she sat at the Master’s feet (something that was
unheard of for a woman in the normal Jewish setting of Jesus’ day). Being
attentive to the Lord Jesus sometimes means being still and not hearing
anything. It is a joyful hope that the Lord Jesus will communicate a message in
His own time. This is the type of “waiting on the LORD” that the Ninevites and
the psalmist did in today’s readings. They were hopeful that GOD would speak a word
of forgiveness, healing, and compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One advantage we have over the Ninevites and the psalmist is
that we know that GOD will hear our prayer and will respond with the graces
that Jesus has produced through His suffering, death, and resurrection. The
hard part is not knowing when and how GOD will communicate the answers to our
prayer and reflections, that is when the reflective “waiting on the Lord” comes
in play. In reality, GOD is constantly communicating with us and will not cease
to share the fullness of the GOoD News until we are with the Lord Jesus in the
heavenly reign where we will experience that GOoD News in its totality. Some
may say that part of the heavenly reign will be enjoying and expanding our
understanding of GOD’s communication for ever, thus we will be actively and
reflectively “waiting on” the Lord Jesus for all eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thinking about the two types of “waiting on the Lord,” St.
Mother Theresa of Calcutta comes to my mind. She actively “waited on the Lord”
in her service of the poor, the sick, and the abandoned.  She also “waited on
the Lord,” in her daily hours of prayer. As has come to light in recent years,
she also did not always receive what she might have expected, and she had to
“wait on the Lord” to reveal the eternal message of the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another example of the two types of “waiting on the Lord” is
St. Faustina, whom we remembered on October 5. She actively served in her
religious community as a cook, gardener, and porter. She also spent hours in
prayer and reflecting on the Lord Jesus as He revealed Himself as the Divine
Mercy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One more person comes to mind. Rev. Richard Rohr, OFM, whose
daily reflections I read, is the founder of the Center of Action and
Contemplation. He and the other members of his community actively work for the
GOoD of others,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and they also spend a great deal of time in contemplating
GOD’s will through prayer and other spiritual practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our journey toward that heavenly reign, let
us seek to “wait on the Lord” both in our actions and in our sitting at the
Master’s feet. We should anxiously, yet confidently, wait for the Lord Jesus.
The verses of Psalm 130 which were not part of today’s Responsorial give us a
clue to how we are to wait: “My soul waits for the LORD more than sentinels wait
for the dawn. . .for with the LORD is kindness and plenteous redemption.” (Ps.
130: 5, 6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of
myself as “waiting on the Lord,” which of the two types of “waiting on the
Lord” do I think of the most: being of service to the Lord Jesus and His
people, or patiently sitting at the feet of the Master and listening to His
Word to me? How can I better “wait on the Lord” in both senses of that phrase?
In what way will I “wait on the Lord” today both in the active sense of serving
others and the reflective sense of patiently awaiting the Lord Jesus’ Word to
me?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all things for which it is
worth waiting.  Through Your GOoDness You have promised to share with us Your
kindness and the salvation that Your Son, Jesus, has gained for us by His death
and resurrection. At times we have been impatient and have not waited for Your
gifts.  We have been overly active in pursuing our own interests and values. 
We have not taken the time to “wait on” You and the message of Your Son.  At
other times we have failed to “wait on” and serve Your people as a sign of our
willingness to “wait on” You.  From the depths of our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>impatience and sinfulness we cry out to You.  Continue to
extend Your pardon and forgiveness to us.  Fill us with the gifts of patience,
hope, and joyful anticipation that flow from Your Holy Spirit’s presence in our
lives.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and
Master-Teacher, Who is awaiting us to “wait on” Him, and Who is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Jonah 4: 1-11;       Psalm 86: 3-4, 5-6,
9-10;       Luke 11: 1-4</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, we are presented with the contrast between human
thoughts and the thoughts of GOD.  In the First Reading, Jonah is angry because
GOD will not destroy Nineveh and its people as Jonah had announced. The
psalmist seems to grasp the proper attitude, praying not only for forgiveness
of his own sins, but praising</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD Who calls all people from all nations into a closer
relationship with the LORD.  In the Gospel, when Jesus is asked by one of His
disciples for a lesson on prayer, Jesus shares with them the prayer to His
Abba-Father and therefore their Abba, the prayer that includes petitions for
the acceptance of GOD’s will and reign and the forgiveness of sins based upon
the forgiveness of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jonah, true human that he is, becomes upset that GOD is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>so merciful with the Ninevites.  Jonah has preached the
“doomsday” message.  He does not want to look like a prophet whose words do not
come true.  He believes that GOD should punish the sinful heathens (non-Jews). 
He really does not see the whole picture of the compassionate GOD Who wants to
bring forgiveness and love to all who repent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and turn towards the Almighty.  Even after GOD provides for
Jonah by shading him under the leaves of a fast growing plant, Jonah still
misses the point of GOD’s desire to have all people come to a relationship with
the LORD.  Jonah does admit that GOD is known for the divine mercy, but he
believes it should only be for himself and the Chosen People (the Jews), not
for heathens like the Ninevites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist first prays for forgiveness for himself.  Like
Jonah, he realizes that GOD is known for clemency and kindness.  The psalmist
concludes the passage with praise of GOD Who is worshiped by people of various
nations as they come before the LORD praising and glorifying GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, after spending time with His Abba in prayer,
Jesus is asked by His disciples</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to teach them how to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pray.  He shares with them a prayer in which they address
GOD as “Father” or “Abba.”  The version found in Luke’s Gospel is shorter than
the one that we have come to use, which is from Matthew’s Gospel.  The key
points are the same:  1) an invocation of GOD as “Abba”; 2) a seeking of the
extension of GOD’s will and reign on earth; 3) a prayer for daily sustenance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4) a plea for forgiveness based upon how we extend</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness to others; 5) a desire to be saved from the
“test.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy for us to get caught up in our own views of
life.  Sometimes, we, like Jonah, don’t want to do GOD’s will because we are
afraid of the reaction we will get from people.  Jonah first fled from GOD
because he did not want to meet the fate of the prophets before him – being
rejected and possibly murdered.  When he finally </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is directed back to doing GOD’s will and announces GOD’s
message, he is not persecuted but is listened to by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Ninevites.  Then Jonah becomes furious because GOD sees
the Ninevites repenting, and GOD decides to turn back from the promised
destruction.  Jonah does not rejoice with GOD’s mercy and forgiveness because
it puts him, the prophet, in the role of not being believable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often we fail to do what we know is right because we are
concerned about how people will respond to our actions!  Then when we do GOD’s
will, we become upset if GOD decides to treat people differently than we expect
GOD to do.  We cannot understand how GOD can show love and forgiveness to
people who are obviously well-known doers of evil, or at least who do not
believe as we do.  We are not willing to forgive those who have consciously
caused us pain, whether they be terrorists, drunk drivers, or serial killers,
or even someone who speaks negatively about us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus directs not only His disciples’ attention, but also
ours, to how we should relate to GOD.  We are invited to call GOD our Abba –
loving and intimate “Daddy.”  And if GOD is our Abba, then we are brothers and
sisters of each other.  We are in relationship with all of GOD’s children, even
those children who are not obedient to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their loving Abba.  We must pray for the coming of the Reign
of GOD, not according to our terms, but according to GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we lift up this prayer to our Abba, we need to pray for
our daily sustenance.  That means that we are concerned not only for the
personal needs we have as individuals, but also for the needs of others.  We
are required to seek the fulfillment of other people’s day-to-day actual
needs.  Also included in this “ideal prayer” is the need to be forgiving as a
requirement for our being forgiven by GOD.  Final we must pray that we are not
tested beyond our ability, and that with the grace of GOD, we will be able to
withstand the test.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This prayer which Jesus taught His disciples (and us) leads
away from selfishness to a sense of relationship with GOD and with others.  It takes
us away from being focused on “me” to focus on “us” and the other members of
the family under GOD, our Abba.  Instead of being exclusive, it is inclusive. 
It should lead us to great praise of the GOD Whom we all can call Abba.  Thus
we can join with the psalmist today and pray:  “All the nations You have made
shall come and worship You, O LORD, and glorify Your name.  For You are great,
and You do wondrous deeds; You alone are GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am struck by how the attitude of seeking GOD's will as
loving children or a loving Abba-Father are not being manifested in our world
today as we see the war going on between the Israelis and the Hamas terrorists
in Gaza and the Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria.  I pray that all turn to our
loving Abba Who is Abba to all people and that they seek to be one in their
searching for a relationship as children of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Have I ever been
mad at GOD because GOD did not act in the way I expected GOD to act?  Do I
sometimes become jealous of GOD’s compassion, especially to people whom I do
not see as deserving of it? What implications are there for me that GOD is our
Abba, not just my Abba? In my dealings with others, how can I demonstrate my
acceptance of all that is implied in the Lord’s Prayer?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all peoples.  Through Your
GOoDness You extend Your forgiveness not only to us, but also to all those who
seek You.  We thank You for sending us Your Son, Jesus, Who has given us the
ability to turn to You and call You our Abba.  May we seek Your Reign over us,
all Your children.  Continue to provide for each and every one of Your
children, each day, and with our being willing to help provide for others. 
Through the working of the Holy Spirit in our lives, helps us to reach out in
forgiveness and love as we have experienced the forgiveness and love You have
offered us in and through Jesus, Your Son.  It is in His name that we make this
prayer, for He is our Brother and Master-Teacher, Who has died, is risen, and
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Malachi 3: 13-20b;          Psalm 1: 1-2, 3, 4
and 6;           Luke 11: 5-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes when we look around, it seems like the wicked are
coming out on top.  The readings today remind us that the GOD (Whom Jesus
revealed) is truly a loving Abba-Father, Who cares for the children who seek to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>do the divine will.  In the First Reading from the prophet
Malachi, the wicked boast that they don’t need to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>follow GOD’s ways and they still have everything they want. 
The excerpt from Psalm 1 echoes the second half of today’s First Reading in
saying that GOD blesses those who fear the LORD and who seek the LORD.  The
Gospel reminds us that we need to constantly show our desire to have GOD answer
our prayer by being persistent in our requests.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prophet Malachi experiences how some of the wicked,
well-off people of his day seem to gloat over the fact that they do not keep
the law or practice penance, but they not only do well, but seem to do better
than those who seek to be faithful to GOD’s laws and ways.  Through the
prophet, GOD addresses the arrogant and tells them that they will eventually
have to answer for their actions.  GOD also speaks reassuring words to those
who “fear the LORD” and do the will of GOD. GOD will be even more compassionate
to the faithful than a loving parent is to the children who do what the parent
asks. Many scholars see the last verses of today’s reading as a promise of the
Messiah Who will come as the Sun of Justice with healing rays.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm today continues the reassuring words that GOD will
eventually lift up the faithful and hold the sinful responsible for their
un-repented actions.  In the end, those who have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“feared the LORD” will be shown the way to glory, while the
way of the evil will end in a negative manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues to talk about prayer (which
began yesterday with the disciples asking Him to teach them to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pray and His sharing the Lord’s Prayer with them).  Today,
Jesus remarks about the importance of being persistent in prayer.  It is not
that GOD does not hear our prayer the first time, but we need to show our
desire to be in relationship with GOD through our on-going prayer.  In the
continued lifting up of our petitions, GOD is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not changed, but our attitude toward GOD grows in a positive
way and we are more aware and open to GOD’s action as a response to our prayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next section of today’s Gospel presents the familiar
words:  “Ask, and you shall receive. . .” What is interesting about the Greek
verbs used (ask, seek, knock) is that they are present active imperatives – a
particular form of the verb that implies repeated action.  We could translate
them as “Ask and keep on asking. . .seek and keep on seeking. . . knock and
keep on knocking.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The final verse of today’s Gospel pericope ends with Jesus
using a similar comparison to the word from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malachi.  GOD is truly the loving Abba-Father Who provides
the very best for the children who seek to do </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s will and desire to have GOD’s blessings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of a “discussion” online by some of my
relatives.  This came after the Las Vegas Massacre in October 2017.  Some were
saying that prayer does nothing, so why pray.   Others in the family were very
adamant about the value of prayer.  They said it was important to pray for the
victims of the Las Vegas rampage and for their families.  In praying we join
them in their sorrow and offer them support as we lift them up to our loving
Abba, His Son Jesus, in the unity of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings are very positive and uplifting for me.  They
give me confidence in my prayer life, and are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reassuring that GOD blesses my efforts, not because I did
them, but because my actions reflect my continued desire to be in relationship
with the Lord Jesus and His Abba (in the union with the Holy Spirit), and our
desire to do GOD’s will.  I realize that as I pray more, I am transformed into
a better person who is in touch with the Lord Jesus.  I am also more open to
accept whatever blessings GOD shares with me, even if those blessings are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not exactly what I request.  Part of my prayer is the
deepening of the fact that GOD knows what is best and, as a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loving Abba, GOD will give me not only what I truly need,
but even more than what I need and even better than that for which I ask.  I
must just “keep on keeping on” in my prayer relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:     What has been my
attitude in prayer, particularly prayer of petition?  Do I continue to ask,
seek, knock, knowing that GOD will respond? Am I transformed as I remain
persistent in prayer?  How can I help others see the value of turning in prayer
to our loving Abba, Who happens to be GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all blessings.  Through Your
GOoDness You pour out Your abundant gifts on all who turn to You and ask, seek,
and knock – that is, on all who continually seek to develop their relationship
with You.  We thank You especially for sending us Your Son, Jesus, Who reminds
us of Your care for us.  He not only spoke of that compassion and love, but He
demonstrated that loving care by His ministry, His suffering and death, and His
resurrection.  We thank You and praise You for all that You do as we turn to
You in our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>prayerful relationship.  We lift this prayer in the name of
Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Savior and Redeemer, Who has suffered,
died, and is risen, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Joel 1: 13-15; 2: 1-2;        Psalm 9: 2-3, 6 and
16, 8-9;          Luke 11: 15-26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings speak of the power of GOD.  The prophet
Joel urges repentance and a time of preparation for the LORD Who will be coming
soon with full power and authority.  The Responsorial Psalm describes GOD
sitting on a throne, judging people with power, justice, and equity.  In the
Gospel, Jesus speaks of the power He has to cast out evil spirits and that
power is a sign of the coming of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joel warns the people that they must be ready for the coming
of the LORD.  The LORD will come with power.  It will be a time when GOD will
condemn the evil and those who do not repent while at the same time the LORD
will be mindful of those who have turned fully toward GOD.  Joel advises the
people that if they do not turn their sinful lives around that they will have
to be held accountable for their wayward actions and the GOD of supreme power
will judge them accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist is a bit more upbeat than the prophet Joel.
Today’s passage is a hymn of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thanks and glory to GOD for GOD’s coming as a just,
equitable, and powerful judge Who will set things straight, rewarding the
faithful, and punishing the wicked.  This judgment is a source of rejoicing for
those who have been oppressed and repressed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus performs an exorcism (casting out of an
evil spirit). This leads some of the people to criticize Jesus saying that He
has this power because He Himself is in league with the devil.  Jesus refutes
their charges and goes on to say that He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has the power of GOD within Him and He is doing His
Abba-Father’s will.  Everyone who does GOD’s will is part of the Reign of GOD,
while those who oppose what Jesus is doing are working against Him and His
Abba.  Jesus also cautions that those who have been freed from the forces of evil
must stay closely connected with GOD or they will be even more affected by the
power of evil and things will be worse off than they were before Jesus’ coming
into their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to misunderstand and misuse power.  And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the worst part of it is that when one becomes obsessed with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>power, that power ends up taking control of the person.  The
old adage is so true:  “Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely!” 
The desire for power can lead a person down the wrong path.  It takes over a
person and makes them unprepared for the Reign of GOD, Who will ultimate come
and set things straight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We can see this throughout history in people like Hitler,
Mussolini, Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Kim Jung Un of North Korea, Putin
of Russia.  Yet we don’t have to look just to political leaders of other
countries. The whole Enron scandal and even the scandal within the American
Catholic Church in regard to clergy abuse can be seen as people in power trying
to maintain their power and leading to lies, deceptions, and the destroying</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of people’s lives.  People might also point to the power of
American political leaders over the past few years.  We might also point a
finger at the governmental officials who did not act fast enough and decisive
enough after natural disasters or who downplayed the pandemic and looked to
themselves as the chosen leaders, even though </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they failed to address the problem of the pandemic, gun
control, abortion laws, and the monetary problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moving closer to home, it is important that we look at our
own lives.  Most of us can probably think of times when we were “power hungry”
and let our desire for power overtake our sense of caring and loving others. 
It may have occurred when we were trying to get ahead in our jobs.  We ended up
doing things that were, at the very least, a bit underhanded or questionable. 
We may have so focused our attentions on what would be to our advantage that we
didn’t realize how we were taking advantage of others.  I know as a teacher, I
was sometimes so concerned in showing my “superior” knowledge and authority
that I ended up (even inadvertently) putting down a student’s answer and making
the student feel belittled.  At other times, I know I have driven my vehicle in
a way that showed other drivers that I was “better” than they and that I
deserved to bend the rules to my benefit and, in doing so, I endangered others,
or at least made them very angry with me.  Also, I have taken time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to reflect on how I have exerted my sense of power and
sought forgiveness from GOD for misusing my authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout His earthly ministry as portrayed in the Gospels,
Jesus shows us what real power is.  He only uses His power when it is for the
betterment of others.  This was obvious during His temptation in the desert. 
He would not exercise His divine power for His own sake.  To Jesus, power is
always used to serve others and to build them up, rather than the way most
power-hungry people use power to lift themselves up and put down others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our readings today, GOD challenges us to look at our own
lives and reflect on how we use power.  GOD has given us a share of divine
power, not just for our benefit, but for the GOoD of others.  We are to use the
power that GOD has shared with us for the building up (edification) of the people
who are called to be part of the Reign of GOD.  When we do this, then we can
join the psalmist in singing not our praise, but more importantly, GOD’s
praise, and realize that GOD will bless our use of the divine power and give us
a great share in the Reign of heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I use the
power that has been given to me?  Do I tend to be self-centered with my
authority or do I use it for the benefit of others? How often do I pray for
those, including myself, who have some power over other people’s lives, asking
GOD to send the Holy Spirit so that they (and I) use the power for the
betterment of others?  What concrete action can I perform today to show others
that I seek to model the servant-leader style of the authority that Jesus
lived?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all power.  Through Your
GOoDness You have allowed humans to share in Your power.  Sadly, many people
(including ourselves) have sometimes abused the power You have bestowed on us
and used it for our selfish ends.  For those perversions in using Your gift, we
seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the inspiration of Your Holy Spirit,
help us look to, and reflect on, the way Your Son used power for the
edification and salvation of others.  Help us to be faithful disciples of the
Master-Teacher and learn from Him, for He is gentle and humble of heart, and
yet masterful in His proper use of power.  We continue to praise and thank You
now and always for You are the Omnipotent (All-Powerful) GOD, Who invites us
into Your Reign.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, our Savior and Master-Teacher, Who has demonstrated His power as He
ministered, suffered, and died for us, and Who has been given the ultimate
power through His resurrection and His living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-xxiii Readings: 
Joel 4: 12-21;         Psalm 97: 1-2, 5-6, 11-12;         Luke 11: 27-28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Doing GOD’s will should bring us joy.  The prophet Joel
proclaims the coming of the LORD Who will act like a reaper at harvest time,
cutting down the infertile and bringing in the worthwhile produce.  The psalm
speaks of the joy that comes to the just.  In the Gospel, Jesus pronounces
another beatitude and calls blessed those who do GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Joel uses an agricultural image in order to bring out the
importance and the imminence of the coming of the LORD.  In the analogy, the
prophet pictures the harvester as going out into the field and using a sickle
to cut down the growth. Growing alongside the GOoD growth is a lot of bad
growth.  The reaper has to separate the weeds and chaff from the GOoD grain. 
The coming LORD is seen in the role of drawing the just and the GOoD close,
while casting out the wicked as waste and debris.  Obviously, there is joy for
those who are gathered to the LORD, while</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the rejected are left out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm portrays the LORD as the royal master
Who comes in majesty and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>glory.  For those who are just and doing the will of the
Master, there is great joy and gladness as GOD bestows divine blessings on
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel’s words of Jesus may seem like a put down of the
“womb which carried” Him and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the “breasts that nursed” Him, but it was not meant to be
that at all.  Jesus is not only saying that obedience to will of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD will create a closer bond with GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>than mere blood relationships, but He is also saying that
His mother is most blessed for her obedience to doing GOD’s will.  It is her obedience
that enabled her to care for her Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder on the readings, I am thinking of the doomsday
view which the First Reading could convey.  Yet, I believe, even GOD, speaking
through the prophet Joel, did not mean to merely shake up the unjust with
threat of punishment.  The prophet of LORD also wanted to bolster and give hope
to those who were seeking to do GOD’s will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I see scripture, the message is primarily GOoD News. 
There is a promise of joy and blessings to those who are faithful to GOD and
GOD’s wishes.  Yes, there needs to be a challenge given to those who only seek
immediate self-gratification at the cost of others.  The major emphasis,
especially in the GOoD News that Jesus preaches, is that GOD has planned and
prepared many joyful and great blessings for those who seek to be a part of the
divine relationship.  GOD desires to draw all people into the joyful, heavenly
reign; but GOD will not have anyone be a part of that joyous reign if they have
not shown that they want GOD to reign in their hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those who have made a conscious effort to discern GOD’s plan
for their lives, such as Mary did, will truly be blessed with a close
relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father in the unity of the Holy
Spirit – closer and more intimate than a child feeding from its mother’s
breast.  GOD wants to nourish us with a source of life more than a nursing
mother desires the best for her child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, we are called to focus on the GOoD News that Jesus
came to bring.  That should be our aim.  Some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people, however, need to be motivated by fear of punishment,
otherwise they will only pursue earthly, selfish pleasures at the expense of
others.  Some people have not moved from the primordial level of doing what is
right </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because of fear of punishment for doing the opposite of the
GOoD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of what I heard on a Christian radio station: 
“The GOoD News is not a matter of religious practice, it is a matter of
relationship.”  GOD wants to have a relationship with us.  GOD wants us to act
as divine daughters and sons, not out of fear of what will happen if we don’t
act properly, but because our behavior should reflect the relationship we have
with a loving GOD and Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our response to GOD’s gracious and loving care for us should
be that of the psalmist today:  “Light dawns</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for the just; and gladness, for the upright of heart.  Be
glad in the LORD, you just, and give thanks to GOD’s holy name.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    What motivates me
to avoid evil and do GOoD, that is, do GOD’s will? Is it fear of the
consequences of sinning?  Or promises of rewards? Or is it in grateful response
to what I have received from our loving GOD? How can I “purify” my intentions
to do all for the glory of GOD? What can I do to help others be more conscious
of the GOoDness of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all blessings.  Through Your
GOoDness You invite us to be a part of Your Reign.  Realizing that some of us
are only motivated by the fear of pain, You have warned us of the punishment
that awaits those who do not do Your will.  Yet the greatest punishment there
ever could be, would be to not be able to enjoy being in relationship with You
– in Your presence forever.  You have promised and continue to reassure us of
Your desire to love us not just now, but also for ever.  Yet sometimes we have
only focused on our immediate self-gratification instead of seeing how we can
be a part of Your plan.  For the times we have failed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to grasp the magnificence of Your love, we seek Your pardon
and forgiveness.  As we lift up this prayer of praise to You, we thank You for
sending us Your Son as the proclaimer of Your GOoD News.  With the assistance
of Your Holy Spirit, help us to stay focused on the message of Your Son, Who
preaches to us in word, in action, in His ministry, suffering, death, and
resurrection.  We pray in His name, for He is Your Son and our Brother,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who is our Master-Teacher and saving Lord, and Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos:  https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-francis-xavier-seelos</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: 2 Kings 5: 14-17;       Psalm 98: 1, 2-3,
3-4;        2 Timothy 2: 8-13;       Luke 17: 11-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is gracious in touching people’s lives.  The response to
such graciousness should be prayerful worship and thanksgiving. In the First
Reading, an Aramean army commander seeks healing from the GOD of Israel.  After
being granted his request, he desires to praise the GOD Who provided the
healing.  The Responsorial Psalm is a reminder that GOD reveals the divine,
saving power to all peoples who in return should sing joyful songs to the
gracious GOD.  In the Second Reading, St. Paul writes Timothy reminding him of
what Paul continues to go through in order that people may come to know the GOD
Who is faithful to the promise of offering salvation to all peoples.  In the
Gospel, the graciousness of GOD, personified in Jesus, touches the lives of ten
lepers, yet only one (a Samaritan) returns to offer thanks to Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading relates the end of the story of Naaman,
the head of the Aramean army, who contracts leprosy (which could be any of
multiple types of skin ailments).  Earlier in the account and not included in
today’s reading, Naaman’s wife’s servant is a girl from Israel who tells of the
great healing done at the hands of the prophet of GOD in Israel.  Naaman
receives the permission of the king of Aram to travel to Israel in search of
healing.  Naaman is directed to the prophet Elisha.  When told to do a simple
plunging (in Greek, baptizein) in the dirty Jordan River, he at first refuses,
since the rivers of his homeland are cleaner and mightier than the Jordan. 
When he is finally convinced to do what the prophet of GOD tells him, he is
cleansed of skin disease.  Today’s passage begins as Naaman plunges into the
Jordan and then wants to offer gifts to Elisha, but the prophet refuses the
gifts.  The healed man requests some of the dirt of the land of Israel so that
he may return home and he can still be a part of the land where there is GOD
Who heals extraordinarily through ordinary means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm proclaims the GOoD news that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD continues to touch all people with divine, saving power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s gift of salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) is given
to any who seek it.  In response to the salus which is given, joyful praise and
thanksgiving is to be lifted up to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a continuation of his Second Letter to Timothy,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul reminds his protégé of the GOoD News that Paul has
preached and that has led to his (Paul’s) imprisonment. Even though Paul is
physically not free and is suffering, he and all other believers have received
spiritual liberty and salvation in and through Jesus.  This gift of salvation
demonstrates GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faithfulness to the promises made long ago – that GOD would
bring salus to the people.  GOD keeps the divine promises, even if mortals fail
to respond faithfully to GOD’s gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, which is unique to St. Luke’s Gospel,
Jesus is entreated by ten individuals suffering from some sort of leprosy (skin
ailment) and ostracization from the community because of their illness. They
have heard about the divine healing power that Jesus has manifested in other
places.  Jesus sends them to the priests who were the officials who could lift
their exile from others by declaring the former lepers clean and able to return
to the rest of society.  On the way, they realize the healing that has taken
place.  Nine continue their mission to the priests to be declared clean, while
one immediately returns to Jesus to express his gratitude for the healing, and
he is a Samaritan, a hated foreigner to the Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings I am once again reminded of the
different aspects of prayer.  Prayer, above all, is how we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relate to GOD; it is our relationship with GOD.  It includes
what I like to refer to as the four aspects of prayer known by </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the word ACTS –  Adoration,  Contrition,  Thanksgiving, and
Supplication.  All four are part of how we relate to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First and foremost, we are to Adore GOD by acknowledging Who
GOD is and giving GOD the honor and praise that is due to the One Who reveals
the divine, saving power and Who is always faithful to the promises made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second purpose of prayer is  Contrition. This is also an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>acknowledgment, but an acknowledgment of who we are –
individuals in need of GOD’s salus. We are afflicted with all sorts of physical
and spiritual ailments that need to be touched by the saving power of GOD. 
Some of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ailments (especially the spiritual ailments – sins) are of
our own doing.  Yet no matter what is causing us to be suffering, we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must admit that we cannot heal ourselves and must seek the
help that comes from GOD alone, in and through Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thanksgiving is the third way we relate to GOD.  As we
reflect on all that GOD has done in touching and healing our lives and giving
us the gift of salvation, we can only respond by expressing our gratitude to
GOD.  There is no way that we can adequately express our appreciation for what
GOD has done, continues to do, and promises to do in the future.  Yet, our time
of relating to GOD and sharing that relationship with others is a sign of our
gratitude and thanksgiving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Last is  Supplication.  Although it should be last, it is
often the first activity of many people (including the lepers in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>today’s Gospel).  Some people only spend time relating to
GOD when they need GOD’s help and expect GOD to perform a miracle for them. 
They, like the lepers, want GOD to bring healing into their lives, but they
often forget to return to thank GOD for the salus which is given.  Some people
only see GOD as a Divine vending machine, to pass out what is needed
immediately if that currency (prayer of petition) is deposited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is faithful to the promises of salvation that have been
revealed throughout scripture.  GOD has revealed not only in words, but also in
actions (particular the actions of Jesus) the saving and healing power that GOD
desires to share with us. GOD extends salus (healing, wholeness, holiness,
salvation) to us so that we would pray – have a relationship with Triune GOD. 
GOD wants a complete and total relationship with us, not just a relationship of
our asking, begging, and expecting GOD to provide for us.  GOD wants us to
acknowledge the saving power that has been offered to us in and through Jesus
and His teaching, ministry, death, and resurrection.  Yes, GOD wants us to
admit our need for help, but GOD also wants us to express our realization of
all the saving and powerful ways that GOD has touched our lives.  Our response
should be to echo the words of the psalmist today and say, “All the ends of the
earth have seen the salvation by our GOD.  Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you
lands: break into song; sing praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How does my prayer
reflect my relationship with GOD? How much time do I spend in prayer? What is
the focus of my prayer time with GOD? Do I adore the Lord for Who GOD is, the
faithful One Who continues to reveal the saving power to me? Do I acknowledge
my need for GOD’s help and salvation, not just so that I can get more from GOD,
but that I might deepen my relationship with the Lord Jesus? How do I express
my gratitude and thanksgiving to GOD? What is my attitude about asking GOD for
things?  How can I more fully share with others my relationship with GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, always faithful and loving. 
Through Your gracious GOoDness, You continue to pour out on us Your loving
gifts of salvation and to reveal Your saving power.  For the times we have not
developed a relationship with You and particularly for the times we have failed
to express true thanksgiving and praise for all You do for us, we seek Your
pardon and forgiveness.  May we continue to lift up our voice in grateful
prayers of adoration, especially in union with Your Son, Who has demonstrated,
in His living among us, how much You love us.  We make this prayer in His name,
for He is our Savior and Master-Teacher, Who has died, is risen, and is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.   Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Marie Rose Durocher:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-marie-rose-durocher</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 1: 1-7;        Psalm 98: 1bcde, 2-3ab,
3cd-4;        Luke 11: 29-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is revealing something great to all who are open to hear
and see.  St. Paul addresses his letter to the faithful in Rome, describing his
mission to the Gentiles and the calling they have received to be beneficiaries
of the GOD’s revelation and salvation.  The Responsorial praises GOD for
revealing the plan of salvation.  In the Gospel, Jesus admonishes His listeners
to pay attention to His teaching, because they are privileged to have the GOoD
News preached to them by the One Who is greater than Jonah and wiser than
Solomon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next few weeks our First Reading (except for special
feast days and Sundays) will be taken from St. Paul’s letter to the Romans.
This is his longest letter, and it differs from his other letters in the fact
that he has not yet been to Rome, so obviously he has not been a part of the
founding of the Christian community in Rome.  Most of this letter presents his
theology and his teaching.  Since he is attempting to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>encapsulate his preaching to show that he is an authentic
apostle, we have a glimpse of what Paul has been led to believe and share with
others. Today begins his epistle (letter) with the expanded formal greetings of
a Greco-Roman letter.  As typical for such a letter, he introduces himself and
addresses the recipients of the letter.  The seven verses which we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have today are actually one sentence in the Greek.  As he
describes his person, he also explains his mission (being sent [“apostled”] to
the Gentiles) and a summary of Who Jesus is (Son of GOD, human descendant of
David, risen Savior).  He changes around the customary “greeting” (chairein) to
“grace” (charis) and adds the customary Semitic statutory wish for peace (the
Greek word eirene is a translation of the Hebrew shalom).  In addressing his
readers, he reminds them that they are called to be holy (“saints”).  This
opening sentence (verses</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1-7) sets the theme and purpose of his letter, his call of
being sent to the Romans to continue to assist them in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their call to be holy (saints).  That is what it means to
belong to Christ Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm is a joyful hymn of praise of the GOD
Who reveals the plan of salvation to people of all backgrounds.  It carries on
the theme introduced in the beginning of the letter to the Romans in that GOD
desires to make known the GOoD News of GOD’s love for all peoples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This message is to be a blessing for, and a source of praise
from, all nations. Thus, it links to Paul’s mission to be the bearer of the
Gospel to the Gentiles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus chides His audience because they are
not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>responding to the GOoD News that He is preaching to them. 
He recalls the story of Jonah, and how the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heathen Ninevites turned from their sinful ways and sought
GOD’s pardon when Jonah preached to them.  Jesus informs His listeners that the
message they are hearing is more powerful and more important than the message
preached by Jonah.  Jesus also recalls how the Queen of the South (Queen of
Sheba) traveled to Jerusalem to hear the wisdom of Solomon.  Yet, the wisdom of
Solomon is inferior to the words of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on today’s readings, two thoughts come to me: 
first,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s initiative in wanting to share the message of
salvation to, and for, all people; second, the need of a response from those to
whom the GOoD News is given.  GOD desires that all people not only hear about
the love that GOD has for them, but GOD also wants them to accept and
experience the salus (healing, wholeness, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation) that Jesus bestows upon them.  GOD continues to
make known this GOoD News, moving from the preaching of the prophets through
the self-revelation in the life and ministry of Jesus, and to the continuation
of the announcement by the disciples and apostles of Jesus (including the great
Apostle to the Gentiles, Paul).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The greatest hindrance to the GOoD News comes from
individuals who are not willing to accept the message of salvation that is
shared with them.  Although GOD’s will is for all to be saved, GOD desires a
freely chosen acceptance of the divine gift of salvation.  Forced acceptance is
not to be tolerated.  The gift of holiness must be desired and accepted by each
individual.  We are called to be holy (to be saints), but we are given the
freedom to not answer the call (although there will be repercussions of such a
choice).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a lot of reasons why people do not choose to
respond to GOD’s invitation.  Some people have never really heard the message
presented in a way that is convincing.  (This obviously is a challenge to us
who believe and are commissioned to share the GOoD News.)  Others have invested
their time and efforts in pursuing other values and they are not willing to let
go of those values in order to embrace the GOoD News.  They cling</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to their power, wealth, fame, beauty, or pleasures.  (These
individuals are overly indoctrinated in the “bad (false) news” being broadcast
by the world.)  Some individuals are too afraid that they may have to suffer or
change, or not be who they think they are.  (They also have not truly heard and
understood the fullness of the Gospel message, or they would realize that they
become the authentic persons GOD wants them to be, only by receiving GOD’s
gifts of salvation.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s reflection leads me to a fuller realization not only
of Paul’s mission as the Apostle to the Gentiles, but to my own calling in
being sent to announce the GOoD News also.  Part of each Christian’s acceptance
of the Gospel is to make the Gospel what it truly is, “GOoD News.”  Once we
embrace the Truth, we cannot hold it within ourselves.  It must be shared.  It
needs to be proclaimed.  We must “shout it from the mountain tops.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That does not mean we have to only announce it in words, but
often, and more importantly, we must give witness to it by our life-style
(recall the words attributed to St. Francis of Assisi:  “Preach the GOoD News
at all times, and, if necessary, use words”).  It is through us and our living
the GOoD News that GOD will announce the GOoD News, and that others will hear
and accept the message of salvation.  It is then that we will be able to say
with today’s psalmist, “All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation by
our GOD.  Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; break into song; sing
praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Who has been
instrumental in my hearing and accepting the GOoD News? Have I thanked GOD and
that person (those persons) for the sharing of the GOoD News with me?  Is my
life a proclamation of the GOoD News? To whom might I be an apostle of the GOoD
News today?  This week?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all GOoD News.  Through Your
GOoDness we have heard the message of salvation.  You have sent Your prophets
of old to prepare Your holy people for the coming of the Messiah.  In the
fullness of time, You sent Your Son, Jesus, to be the source of salvation by
His teaching, ministry, suffering, death, resurrection, and ascension.  So that
the Gospel of salvation would be available to all people at all times following
His return to You, He commissioned His disciples to be bearers of the GOoD
News, and He empowered them by sending the Holy Spirit.  We thank You for
calling us to be Your holy ones (saints) who live the Gospel and assist in the
process of bringing to others the message of salvation.  At times we have
failed to listen to the Word and have shirked our responsibilities in
furthering the spread of the Gospel.  We ask that You pardon us and, through
the power of Your Holy Spirit, strengthen us in our mission to be proclaimers

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Carlo Acutis:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-carlo-acutis/
Readings:  Romans 1: 16-25;        Psalm 19: 2-3, 4-5;        Luke 11: 37-41</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How easy it is for humans to misunderstand and deceive
themselves concerning the Truth of Faith.  In the First Reading, St. Paul
addresses the failure of people to accept the gift of coming into a
relationship with GOD that was offered to the Jews throughout Hebrew scriptures
and presented to the Gentiles through nature.  The Responsorial Psalm proclaims
the revelation of GOD through the beauty of creation.  In the Gospel, as He
dines with a Pharisee, Jesus chides the Pharisees for their over-stressing of
laws and missing the point of being in relationship with the Creator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this part of his letter to the Romans, St. Paul boasts
about his mission as minister of the Gospel.  He is not ashamed of proclaiming
the GOoD News as found in Jesus Who has died and is risen.  He justifies his
teaching because it is based on the gift of Faith he has received from GOD. 
Paul then proceeds to describe how both the Jews and the Gentiles have
misinterpreted the Truth of Faith by trying to form Faith into what they want
it to be, rather than the gift from GOD that Faith truly is.  The Jews, the
first to whom the gift of Faith has been extended, have transformed Faith into
a set of rules and regulations that lead the believer away from GOD with its
emphasis on rules and laws, rather than developing a relationship with GOD. 
The Gentiles have the opportunity to understand GOD as Creator as they look to
the wonders GOD has created.  Their misunderstandings flow from their trying to
worship creation and creatures instead of the Creator.  Because of mortals’
aberrations of the Truth of Faith, they have been “handed over” to impurity and
idolatry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a declaration that even nature proclaims the
majesty of GOD the Creator.  Creation cannot be silenced as it gives honor to
the One Who brought it into existence.  Humans are the ones who have the free
will to choose not to honor the Creator and they are the ones who have done
just that, by twisting the understanding of the GOD Who creates out of love for
humans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as Jesus dines at the home of a Pharisee, He
is questioned</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>about His failure to observe the Jewish ritual washings. 
Jesus challenges His host and the other Pharisees for their missing the point
of ablutions.  The rituals of washing are to signify that the person is pure in
intention and mind.  Jesus criticizes the emphasis that some of the Jewish
leaders put on legalistic practice while missing the relationship that the
practices are meant to deepen the relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that the heathens
from the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Greco-Roman times and the Jews of Jesus’ time were not the
only ones who have not accept the gift of Faith for what it is.  There are many
people today, myself included, who, at times, have tried to shape religion into
a substitute for Faith.  Faith is of divine origin.  It is a gift that GOD
gives to us.  It is something that must be accepted and lived.  Yet, because of
our desire to “make sense” of this divine gift, we sometimes shape our
practices to fit into what we want Faith to be.  We build all sorts of
structures, rituals, and regulations around the gift and say that all of those
human additions are also what GOD intends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The simplicity and Truth of Faith is that GOD loves us and
wants us to share that divine love with others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is the GOoD News Jesus proclaimed in word and action. 
That is the Truth Paul preached and was proud to assert.  That is the Faith
that has been given to us to share with others.  Yes, the Truth of Faith must
be accepted and internalized and made visible by the way we live each day, but
it does not need to be overly systematized and regulated.  I believe that some
framework can be helpful to the spread of Faith, but if the structure becomes
more intent on preserving itself than in spreading the Faith, it is no better
than the impure and idolatrous practices mentioned in today’s readings. 
Anything that enhances the relationship with GOD (and therefore with others),
which Faith is meant to be, is to be appreciated.  While anything that becomes
a skandalon (scandal or stumbling block) to the true Faith relationship with
GOD and with others must be abolished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seems that Pope Francis would agree.  He has demonstrated
that he is more interested in individuals and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their relationship with GOD than the overly strict
observance of rules and regulations.  He has challenged people to focus on what
is important:  relationships with GOD and with others and with all of GOD’s
creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, we must be discerning in our use of rituals and structures. 
We must look to the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the Word of GOD.  We must
be willing to strive to be authentic to true gift of Faith that GOD has given
us in and through the life and ministry of Jesus.  Then we will be able to join
with all creation in declaring the glory of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On October 15, we would have celebrated the Memorial of St.
Theresa of Jesus (of Avila), if it had not been a Sunday.  St. Theresa seems to
have struggled with the same division in her life, particularly in her prayer
life.  For many years, she would practice the routine of recited prayers, but
had trouble dealing with her Faith relationship with Jesus and His
Abba-Father.  Let us look at our own life of Faith and see if are seeking a
deeper relationship with our Triune GOD and other people and creation, or we
only trying to practice the rituals of our religion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I ever confuse
Faith with religion?  Do I seek to practice a religion rather than live a Faith
relationship with GOD and with others? How does my Faith make itself evident in
the way I live my life and interact with others? What can I do to enhance the
Faith relationship of others with the GOD Who is seeking that relationship with
them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all creation.  Through Your
GOoDness You have impressed Your image into all that You have created.  You
have made all for the purpose of drawing humans into a closer relationship with
Yourself.  We, however, have misunderstood Your self-revelation and have
interpreted the reflection of You as Who You are.  We have raised up aspects of
Your creation to the objects of our worship.  We have failed to see the Giver
and focused on the signs of Your giving.  For our sinful misconceptions and
false practices, we ask Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the power and
inspiration of Your Holy Spirit, help us to focus on the gift of Faith – Your
true self-revelation – drawing us ever closer to You.  We thank You and praise
You especially for the greatest self-revelation and gift in the person of Your
Son, Jesus, Who was born, ministered with word and action, suffered, died, rose
and is once again with You in heaven.  Continue to help us keep our eyes
focused on Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Lord, as we reflect on the gift of
Faith and salvation that He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has shared with us and which we are to share with others. 
We make this prayer in the name of the same Jesus, Your Son and our Brother,
the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 2: 1-11;        Psalm 62: 2-3, 6-7,
9;           Luke 11: 42-46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings may leave some of us feeling a bit uneasy. 
GOoD!  St. Paul warns the Christians in Rome that they should not judge others
for their unfaithfulness, since all are sinners and deserve to be punished by
GOD.  The psalm offers a source of hope – hope in the GOD Who is stable,
strong, and saving.  In the Gospel, Jesus not only condemns the actions and
attitudes of the Pharisees but also those of the scholars of the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s First Reading, St. Paul is addressing the Jewish
members of the Christian community at Rome.  They seem to be acting with an
attitude of superiority over the Gentiles who have become believers.  The
Judaic Christians find it easy to cast blame and accusations at the former
heathens, pointing out all their actions that are contradictory to being a
faithful believer.  Paul warns the Hebrew Christians that they, too, are sinful
and have been unfaithful to GOD in their lives.  If they condemn the former</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pagans for their sins of infidelity, they will also be
judged for being unfaithful to GOD.  The sinful and unrepentant Jews will be
the first to be condemned because they had the advantage of knowing GOD long
before the pagans. Yet, the humble and contrite Jews who have come to believe
in Jesus will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>receive GOD’s blessings first, since they have had a
connection with GOD for a longer period of time.  Yet, in the end there is no
difference with GOD since GOD loves and saves all people through Jesus and all
will enjoy life for all eternity if they are faithful to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist affirms the belief and trust in a loving, saving
GOD Who is the source of stability and power in one’s life.  Only with GOD can
one find rest for one’s soul, since GOD is the source of all Shalom – peace.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, continues His warning of the leaders
of the Jewish faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of these so-called leaders are more concerned about how
they look in people’s eyes than about their relationship with GOD.  They want
to be held in high esteem, but they are not willing to help those whom they
have been called to serve.  The “scholars of the law” are also chastised for
their burdening the people with impossible tasks of keeping the laws.  They
impose the load without doing anything to lighten it for those who are
struggling with adherence to the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that I have been too
legalistic at times.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have been a stickler for adherence to the rules and
regulations, especially for others.  I remember times when others would say to
me, “Get a life, instead of trying to impose a life-sentence on us.”  I recall
times when I would try to do everything by the book.  I thought</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that if I did that then I would “earn” my way to heaven.  I
also tried to force others to adhere to my interpretation of the rules.  I
became uptight, tense, and unbearable.  I made it hard for people to relate to
me other than with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I have grown in my relationship with the Lord Jesus, I
have come to appreciate how loving, understanding, and forgiving GOD is.  I
realize that I do not deserve the gifts and blessing GOD has bestowed on me.  I
have been as unfaithful, if not more unfaithful, than others.  I have had the
benefit of being given the gift of faith from my childhood.  I should have
known better and acted gratefully and grace-fully in response to the Lord
Jesus’ graciousness. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With this renewed sense of GOD’s loving kindness, I have
learned to be more understanding and forgiving of others.  I need to be
consoling and comforting to those who are struggling to get their lives
together in GOD’s sight.  Offering words of solace and affirmation, rather
words of condemnation, can enable others to accept the forgiveness that GOD
offers.  It is with such a positive and edifying attitude that we can show our
relationship with GOD and our acceptance of others and pray with the psalmist
today, “Trust in GOD at all times, O my people!  Pour out your hearts before
the LORD; GOD is our refuge!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Have I ever shown
an attitude of superiority over others? Are the faults I criticize in others
the same faults of which I am guilty? How have I experienced the loving pardon
of the Lord Jesus?  What can I do to help others sense that GOD is willing to
forgive them as they turn to the Lord Jesus seeking pardon?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all forgiveness.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have been offered a share in Your Reign.  This offer is not made
to us because of who we are or what we do, but because of Who You are and what
You have done – the Lover Who loves us beyond our worth.  As we have journeyed
in faith, we have sometimes had a superior attitude over those who are more
recent travelers on the path toward You.  We have been willing to point out the
errors of their ways, forgetting all the times we, ourselves, have gone off
track.  For our condemning attitudes toward others, we seek Your continued
forgiveness.  Following the example of Your Son, Jesus, help us to be loving of
all individuals, while despising wickedness and sin.  With the grace of Your
Holy Spirit, let us turn to You, the Source of hope, strength, peace, and
rest.  We make this prayer through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Our Savior and Redeemer,
Who has died for us, is risen, and now is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-margaret-mary-alacoque</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 3: 21-30;               Psalm 130: 1b-2,
3-4, 5-6ab;            Luke 11: 47-54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith is essential to life with GOD.  Saint Paul describes
faith as the gift of GOD to which the Law and the Prophets testified, but is
separate from the Law and the Prophets.  The psalm reiterates the theme that
the relationship with GOD (faith) has its origin with GOD, not with us.  In the
Gospel, Jesus continues His diatribe against the errors of some of the Jewish
leaders.  He is upset that not only are they performing sinful and hateful acts
(similar to the killing of the prophets) and thus making themselves unable to
receive the gifts of GOD, but also they are blocking the people, whom they are
called to serve, from receiving GOD’s gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul is quite emphatic on the importance of faith. 
Faith is the only thing that can lead to eternal life with GOD.  Faith is first
and foremost a gift from GOD.  It is not anything we can earn or merit. 
Although it is distinct from the Law and the Prophets (the teaching and
preaching of Hebrew scriptures), it is alluded to by the whole of Hebrew
scriptures.  The Law was original meant to be a guideline to demonstrate that
GOD was gifting people with faith.  Yet, throughout Jewish history, it became
the be-all and end-all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of some people in Judaism.  Paul states quite assertively
that no one can obey the totality of the law, and that all have sinned.  The
law has become the vehicle of condemnation, not justification.  The only thing
that brings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>justification and righteousness is GOD’s gift of faith which
was made possible with the death and resurrection of Jesus.  No one can boast
that they have saved themselves.  It is only GOD who saves (Jesus = Yeshua =
“GOD saves”) and it is only GOD who gives the gift of faith.  Once one has
accepted the faith given by GOD, one can live as a person who knows the
justification that has come from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reminds us that if GOD held against us the sins we
have committed,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there would be no hope for any of us.  Yet, the psalmist
reminds us, the mercy and forgiveness of GOD lifts us up from the depths to
which our sins have plunged us. GOD is merciful and forgiving so that we might
give GOD the glory and praise which the LORD deserves.  We may have to wait for
a while before we experience the fullness of the life which GOD offers us, but
GOD has promised to save and redeem all those who turn to the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues to condemn the actions of
some of the Jewish religious</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leaders.  They have become so pre-occupied with their own
interpretations and embellishments of the Law that they have missed the point
of the Law – a sign of the gift of faith with which GOD has gifted the people. 
Their absorption in the details and ramifications of the Law have prevented
them from experiencing the gifts that GOD has given, and therefore they have
isolated themselves from the Giver.  Jesus is even more upset that by their
attitudes, they have not only made themselves unable to experience GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>love and forgiveness, but also and more importantly, they
have prevented others from growing in a closer relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith is the key to eternal life.  This key, however, is not
something that we can purchase.  It is not something that we earn or deserve. 
It is a gift from GOD.  GOD wants us to use this key to enter into the divine
presence and experience all that GOD has in store for us.  Some people have
refused the key.  Others have taken the key but do not choose to use the key. 
And there are some who take the key and reshape it into what they want the key
to open, which is not the passageway to GOD’s presence.  Finally, there are
those who gratefully accept the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>key and demonstrate their desire to enter into the Reign of
GOD by using the key the way it was meant to be used – for opening the door to
life with GOD, not only for themselves, but also for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When GOD gives the key, there are directions attached.  Some
people have taken the directions and given their own interpretations to the
directions.  They have expanded the directions to such a point that to follow
their interpretation of the directions, one is hindered in using the key and
forced to burden oneself with a bunch of unnecessary items.  All the additional
baggage one is told to carry prevents a person from easily carrying the key and
more importantly using the key in the way that GOD has proposed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I see that I am being called to respond gratefully and
lovingly to the key (faith) that GOD has given me.  Yes, I must be attentive to
the directions that came with the key.  They are to guide me in the proper use
of the key.  I also realize that I have sometimes misused the key by flinging
it around and hitting others with the key, rather than sharing the key of faith
that GOD has given and helping others use the key.  I need to acknowledge my
own</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sinfulness and need for the forgiveness that comes with the
key.  It is only then that I will be able to enter into the place that GOD has
prepared for me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Oh, by the way, the key is cruciform (cross-shaped).  It is
the cross on which our Savior has died, and from which He was taken down and
buried, only to rise again on the third day.  Embracing the cruciform key means
to be willing to lift high the cross and point to it as the key that opens the
door to eternal life.  GOD has given us the key and has promised the fullness
of life when we take and use that key of faith to enter into the divine
presence. We must trust in GOD and believe that the Lord Jesus will give us all
that is intended by the key.  It is then that we will be able to join the
psalmist today and say, “I trust in the LORD; my soul trusts in GOD’s word.  My
soul waits for the LORD, more than sentinels wait for the dawn.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What have I done
with the key of faith that GOD has offered to me? Am I aware of the directions
that came with the key, and do I use the directions to assist me in my proper
use of the key?  Have I focused more on my interpretation of the directions and
my desire to use the key in the way that I want rather than in the way GOD
intends?  How can I help others to be open to the gift of the key of faith that
GOD is offering to them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all GOoD gifts.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have so many gifts, of which faith is the key that opens us to the
fullness of all You want to share with us.  At times we have refused the key of
faith, or have taken it and not used it.  We have sometimes misinterpreted what
You wanted us to do with key of faith and the directions that came with it.  We
have at times made our own view of the directions more important than the key
itself.  For our sinful ways, we ask for Your forgiveness.  We thank You and
praise You not only for the key of faith, but for sending Your Son, Jesus, to
make it possible for us to have the key and all that is behind the door/gate
that the key opens.  We are appreciative of all that Jesus has done through His
life, ministry, His death, resurrection, and ascension.  He has demonstrated
the salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) that is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>behind the door that the key You have given us opens. 
Continue to empower and guide us with the presence of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Holy Spirit in our lives.  To You all glory and honor is
given not only as we journey with the key of faith, but also when we arrive at
the door to Your presence and enter into Your glory.  We make this prayer in
the name of the same Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the Way, the Truth, and
the Life, Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Ignatius of Antioch</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Fri. of 28th Week in Ord. Time)</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-ignatius-of-antioch</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 4: 1-8;          Psalm 32: 1b-2, 5,
11;          Luke 12: 1-7</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are reminded, once again, that GOD’s will is that we
experience divine favor.  In speaking of what allowed Abraham to be the “Father
of nations,” St. Paul refers to his faith, not his actions.  The psalm links
salvation not to our actions but to the forgiveness of GOD after we have
acknowledged our sins.  In the Gospel, we have a compilation of many ideas
including the hypocrisy of some of the Jewish leaders, the proclamation of the
GOoD News, and GOD’s loving care for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In expanding upon his thoughts about salvation through
faith, St. Paul turns his (and his audience’s) attention to Abraham, the father
of Jewish people and the “Father of nations.”  What made Abraham special was
his acceptance of the gift of faith that was offered to him by GOD.  After
Abraham believed (accepted the gift of faith), he was justified, and his
actions reflected the faith alive in him.  Paul also uses the comparison of
wages and credits.  When a person is paid because of the work they do, they are
given a wage, they earn their pay.  When someone extends credit/ gift card to
an individual, it is not because of the work that has been accomplished by the
individual, but because of the kind gift of the giver. Faith is a credit/gift
card bestowed on an individual.  After the gift card of faith has been given to
an individual, they must respond to the gift by living in a way that shows
appreciation for the gift given.  It is never possible to “pay back” this credit/gift
card, but our actions can be a sign of gratitude for the credit/gift card we
have been given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since St. Paul quoted part of Psalm 32, today’s Responsorial
is taken from that psalm.  It is GOD’s act of forgiveness, freely</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>given, that is a blessing (a gift) from GOD.  Forgiveness of
sins should lead to rejoicing in the LORD.  Psalm 32 is used as another example
of GOD’s graciousness and forgiving nature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Forgiveness is also a credit/gift from GOD, for the debit of
sin run up by the sinner.  GOD does not need to extend the credit of
forgiveness, nor can an individual earn forgiveness.  It is only the
graciousness of GOD that allows people to have faith and forgiveness, and then
to respond by trying to live a live that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflects the awareness of the blessings that have been given
by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel pericope, we have a few unconnected
passages, put together as words of advice to Jesus’ disciples and the people. 
Jesus warns them to avoid the leaven of the Pharisees.  The bad (negative)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>growth of Pharisees’ leaven produces only more bad growth or
no growth. Their hypocrisy has been spoken about in the previous verses (the
Gospel reading for the last few days).  Next, Jesus foretells the spread of the
GOoD News.  What the disciples have been hearing during their private
instructions from Jesus will need to be preached openly for all to hear.
Following this, Jesus addresses their concerns about being persecuted,
informing them that injury and death of the human body are not the worst thing
that can happen.  Worse by far is being deprived of eternal life with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD because of our unrepented sins.  Finally, Jesus
reassures His disciples that GOD, His Abba-Father, loves </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>them and cares for them more than the way GOD cares for the
birds of the air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am touched by the love that
GOD has for each and every individual, including you, and me.  It is true that
GOD is concerned about all of creation, but the climax and most important part
of creation on earth is humanity.  GOD has created us in the divine image,
something that cannot be said as much of the rest of creation.  Not only has
GOD created us, but also the LORD gifts us with faith and forgiveness, things
we can never earn.  These are credits/gifts bestowed upon us by a loving and
caring GOD Who desires us to not only have earthly, human life, but also a
share in the eternal, divine life of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Carrying on the analogy of accounting used by Paul, we
cannot work so as to have wages of eternal life.  It is credit/gift put into
our account.  It is GOD’s gift to us.  Yes, we can do things to show our
appreciation and gratitude to GOD for gifting us, but faith and salvation
(divine life) are gifts, pure and simple.  Likewise, we can run up a debit. 
The debit that we encounter is from our sinfulness.  Any and all sins are so
huge a debit, that there is no way we can ever bring ourselves to the position
of paying off the debit.  It is only GOD’s gift of forgiveness, through Jesus’
death and resurrection, that allows us to be free from the debit we have
amassed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is more than an eternal accountant Who wipes away our
debit and gives us credit beyond our ability to pay back.  GOD loves us and
desires to have a relationship with us.  So not only is GOD our “Sugar Daddy”
who gifts us with an unlimited account, but also the LORD GOD is also our
loving Abba Who cares for us more than we will ever know, but we will have an
eternity to try to learn and experience that loving care and to give praise and
honor to our loving Abba Who is so generous to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only things that GOD asks of us in return is our
acceptance of the divine gifts of faith, forgiveness, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation, and the demonstration of our gratitude by
admitting our need for a relationship with the Almighty and joyfully giving glory
and praise, especially in a way that enables us and others to be reminded of
the graciousness of GOD.  Thus, we can pray with the psalmist today:  “Be glad
in the LORD, and rejoice you who have been justified; exult, all you upright of
heart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I reflect on
the debit and credit account of my spiritual life, what reaction do I have?  Do
I realize the debit I have accumulated because of my sins? How do I respond to
the limit-less credit that GOD has extended to me, and which I will never be
able to repay?  Do I use the gifts which that credit enables me to have in
order to show my appreciation to the GOD Who has gifted me? How can I help
others realize the graciousness of the GOD Who wipes out the debits and extended
unlimited credits to us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all gifts.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have been blessed beyond our ability to ever repay.  You do not
expect repayment, for that would diminish Your graciousness.  We do not, nor
would we ever be able to, make any sort of restitution to You.  As we reflect
on the debit account we have amassed because of our sinfulness, we come before
You contrite and humble, asking for something that we do not deserve</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– Your unconditional forgiveness, that has been gained by
the death and resurrection of Your Son.  As we continue our journey to the
heavenly home You have prepared for us, help us to be mindful of Your
graciousness.  May we not only express our gratitude in prayers of praise and
thanks, but also enable us, through the power of Your Holy Spirit, to share
Your graciousness with others by treating them in a way that they may know Your
loving gifts.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our
Brother, Who revealed to us Your kindness and love by His life, ministry, His
death, resurrection, and ascension, and Who is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Luke:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-luke</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:     2 Timothy 4: 10-17b;      Psalm 145: 10-11, 12-13,
17-18;       Luke 10: 1-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we reflect on the life and ministry of Saint Luke,
physician, artist, and evangelist.  Although only the First Reading speaks
about St. Luke himself, we can gather a lot of information about him from the
two works that he wrote in the Christian scriptures (the New Testament):  the
“third” Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. In our First Reading today, St.
Paul writes that Luke alone was with him as he wrote from his imprisonment in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rome.  The psalm speaks about the spread of the Reign of GOD
through the works of those called by GOD to be friends of GOD.  In the Gospel,
Jesus commission His disciples to go out and proclaim the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. Paul, already in confinement for
being a Christian, has sent some of his followers to tend to the needs of the
people in the communities he has helped establish.  Luke alone is left with
Paul.  Luke is obviously a trusted friend who brings comfort and compassion to
Paul.  Paul asks Timothy to do him some favors and to watch out for some of the
so-called “believers” who are subverting the true preaching and teaching of
Christ, as preached by Paul.  [A GOoD movie which shows the interaction between
St. Luke and St. Paul is called “Paul, the Apostle of Christ” from ODB Films
and Affirm Films.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist, centuries before Jesus, realizes that the
Reign of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is spread by those who consider themselves friends of
GOD,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faithful followers of GOD.  The LORD is close to all who
call upon GOD and seek GOD’s help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus “apostles” His disciples.  He “sends
out” those who have heard the GOoD News.  Jesus wants the Reign of GOD to be
announced to all the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings and the life of St. Luke, I
realize that there is not a lot of direct (in the New Testament) information
about St. Luke.  Obviously, he was a learned Greek physician.  He is well
educated, not just because he was a physician, but also his writings show a
highly polished style of writing.  He probably never met Jesus in person.  Yet,
he apparently had close contact</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with many eye-witnesses and followers of Jesus, possibly
including Jesus’ mother, Mary and John and Paul (who only met Jesus on the Road
to Damascus.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have always like St. Luke.  Part of this comes from
growing up in a parish with name of St. Luke the Evangelist.  I also enjoyed
reading Luke’s Gospel and the Act of the Apostles in Greek.  I have studied
Luke’s writings and am impressed not just with his style. but also with the
flow of, and between, the contents of his two works.  Guided by the Holy
Spirit, Luke brings out points not present in the other Gospel accounts.  Being
a Gentile before becoming a Christian, Luke has a more universal theme in
proclaiming the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luke is truly an evangelist, one who proclaims GOoD News. 
His infancy narrative (chapters 1 and 2) portrays the early life of Jesus and
His family not only in a way that shows Luke’s knowledge of Jewish scripture
(the Old Testament), but also in a way that brings out the more compassionate
and “motherly” side of the events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The beginning of Luke’s Gospel traces Jesus’ roots back to
Adam and Eve.  He thus begins at the very “beginning” [Genesis], including the
full range of history down to the time of Jesus.  All these things point to the
compassion and caring of GOD, especially for the poor, disenfranchised, and
lowly.  Luke relates more accounts of women in his Gospel than the other
evangelists (women including Mary, Elizabeth, Anna, Mary Magdalene). Some of
the passages found only in Luke are the GOoD Samaritan (Luke 10: 25-37); the
Prodigal Son (Luke 15: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11-32); the curing of the ten lepers with only the Samaritan
coming back to thank Jesus (Luke 17: 11-19).  Luke concludes his Gospel
addressing Theophilus (“Lover of GOD”) and shares Jesus’ call to spread the
Gospel to all nations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Luke begins his second work (The Acts of the Apostles),
he continues his writing to Theophilus and he shows the spread of Christianity
from Jerusalem, to the rest of the Holy Land and out to all the known world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What impresses me about Luke is that he manifests the great
compassion and loving mercy of Jesus for all people.  [Because of Luke’s
emphasis on the loving mercy of Jesus and His Abba-Father in unity with the
Holy Spirit, Pope Francis choose the “C” Cycle (centered on the Gospel of Luke)
as the Extraordinary Jubilee of GOD’s mercy.]  Although educated, Luke never
puts on an air of superiority.  He is loving, caring, and a GOoD friend to Paul
(and presumably many other people).  Some scholars believe that he may have
been close to Mary, the mother of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, because he shares more intimate details of the
infancy of Jesus than the other evangelists.  No matter what, Luke is an
evangelist – a person who spreads the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that I am called to follow in the footsteps of
Luke.  Like Luke, I must use my knowledge and skills to further the spread of
the Reign of GOD.  I must not be haughty or overpowering in my proclaiming the
GOoD News.  I must act with the same compassion and caring that is exhibited by
Luke and the individuals in his writings, especially Jesus as revealed by
Luke.  If I can do that, then hopefully the psalm refrain from today will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be said of me as well as others who follow the Master, “Your
friends make known, O LORD, the glorious splendor of Your Reign!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I see myself as
an “evangelist” – one who proclaims GOoD News?  How can I bring GOoD News to
someone today?  Is my life a proclamation of the Gospel (GOoD News) of Jesus? 
Do I show the same qualities of universal love and care for the lowly as Jesus
does and as is portrayed in Luke’s Gospel?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever compassionate and
universally caring for all people.  Through Your GOoDness, You have given us an
example of one who strove to be like You and Your Son.  We remember the
evangelist Luke today and reflect on his desire to proclaim Your GOoD News to
all peoples.  May we realize</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our call to be evangelists to those we meet, not just in
what we write and say, but also, and more importantly, in how we treat others. 
May we take a lesson from some of the parables of Jesus only found in Luke’s
Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May we realize Your love and mercy as the Prodigal Son did
from his father.  May we be like the Good Samaritan and show compassion towards
everyone we meet, even if they are our supposed enemies.  By the power of the
same Holy Spirit Who guided Luke in his ministry and writing, may we be
empowered to spread the GOoD News to all we meet, especially the lowly,
outcast, and humble.  We make this prayer in the name of the Master and Lord
Whom Luke proclaimed in his writing, Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

7-8;      2 Timothy 3: 14-4:2;      Luke 18: 1-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two aspects of prayer are presented in today’s scripture
passages.  The First Reading and the Gospel describe the importance of
persistence in prayer.  The selection chosen from the continued reading of St.
Paul’s Letter to Timothy stresses the pre-eminent value of the Word of GOD in
our daily prayer life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Israelites confront the Amalekites, two actions are
going on.  The first is the activity of Joshua and his soldiers in the actual
battle.  The second is the attitude and posture of prayer by Moses with the
help of two attendants.  From atop a hill, Moses takes the position of lifting
his hands up to the LORD, invoking GOD’s assistance for those who are fighting
the GOoD fight below him.  As long as Moses keeps his hand raised in praise of
GOD and intercession for the troops, the Israelites have the upper hand.  As
Moses’ hands tire, he is assisted by Aaron and Hur, who position themselves on
either side of Moses, holding his hands in the prayerful posture.  In the end,
the Israelites win the battle decisively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial echoes the thoughts that it is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD Who is the true source of help and victory in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the struggles of life.  GOD continues to protect and care
for all those who call on the help of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul encourages Timothy to
continue to center his ministry on the Word of GOD.  The scriptures are the
handbook and user’s manual that are necessary in the living out of one’s life. 
Since, as Paul tells</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Timothy, all of GOD’s Word is inspired (GOD has breathed the
“Spirit into” the Word and breathes out the Spirit through the Word), then
within the Holy Writ can be found the instruction, the encouragement, the
challenge, and the wherewithal to be equipped with whatever is necessary to
continue our journey of faith.  The Word of GOD must be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the source of ministry, as the faithful disciples carry on
the work of their Master-Teacher with all patience and understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel begins by saying that Jesus instructs His
disciples in the necessity of praying without tiring.  Yes, prayer must be
filled with hope, with the knowledge that GOD hears and responds, but it also
must be constant, non-stopped, even</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>if one is tired.  It is the persistence in prayer that
demonstrates our desire to have a continued relationship with our GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings for today, I think about
various aspects of prayer.  Prayer is the constant relationship that I have
with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit.  I
cannot limit my prayer just to an hour or so on Sunday, or even to my daily
morning and night prayers, which are also important.  Prayer has to be the
attitude that I have that reminds me of the loving relationship I have with my
Lord Jesus.  I must, as St. Paul says, “pray constantly” (Ephesians 6:18). 
That doesn’t mean that I am continuously reciting rote prayers, although that
is better than not praying at all.  It means that I am always to be aware of my
relationship with GOD and seek to develop and enhance that relationship by
thinking more and more </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>about the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tied into the concept of being “faithful in prayer” (Romans
12: 12) is the idea of the source of prayer being based on GOD’s Word.  I must
not just occasionally pick up the Bible and read it.  Rather, I must devour the
Word of GOD on a regular, daily basis.  I must be formed and equipped with what
I find and study in the scriptures.  My life must be a living testimony to
GOD’s Word.  It is when I open the pages of GOD’s Word and apply it to my life
that I become equipped to do battle with the enemies who are out to defeat me
and all of GOD’s faithful people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also encouraged by the realization that both in my
prayer life and in my reading and understanding GOD’s Word, that I do not have
to do it alone.  Just as Moses had the assistance of Aaron and Hur, so I can
call on the help and prayerful support of others who are desirous of GOD’s forces
winning the battle against evil and ways of the world (as opposed to the ways
of GOD).  When I gather with others who are also seeking to deepen their
relationship with GOD through prayer and the better understanding of GOD’s
Word, it is then that I can be more assured that I am being authentic and
faithful in my living out by relationship with the Lord Jesus.  Our parish
promotes the reading of the Word of GOD daily by distributing The Word Among Us
monthly magazine, which gives the readings for every day and a Meditation on
the Word.  We also have many Bible Study groups that focus on the readings for
the upcoming Sunday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded of this at a Bible Study meeting.  We were
discussing how our prayer life/relationship with the Lord</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus must be more than just an hour a week.  By the fact
that we spend time at the Bible Study, and also time preparing for it, we make
ourselves more open to GOD’s Word and to having a prayerful attitude more than
just during the weekly assembly at church.  Yet, even those extra hours
preparing for and being at the Bible Study are not enough.  We must pray
regularly and have a mindset focused on the Lord Jesus each and every day, and
throughout each day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prayer thus flows from the Word of GOD, (both that which we
read in the Bible and the Incarnate Word of GOD).  It is bolstered both by my
own personal exercise of the discipline of prayer and in the sharing in
communal activity of prayer.  It is when I, both alone and in community,
dedicate myself to prayer and the proclamation of GOD’s Word that I am equipped
to fight the lengthy battle against all who would desire to destroy the
awareness of GOD’s presence among the faithful and in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My constant attitude must be that of being aware of GOD,
being in relationship with the Lord Jesus through prayer, and being formed by
GOD’s Word.  It is then that I can join the psalmist today and proclaim: “I
lift up my eyes toward the mountains; from where help shall come to me?  My
help is from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How does my prayer
life and my study of the Word of GOD deepen my relationship with GOD? Do I pray
constantly or is prayer just an occasional occurrence in my daily living? How
does the reading of GOD’s Word enhance my prayer life – my relationship with
the Lord Jesus? How can the activities of other believers enrich my prayer life
and my understanding of GOD’s Word? What steps can I take to deepen both my
prayer life and my devouring of the Word of GOD? How can I help others to delve
into the Word of GOD and be in a prayerful attitude?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, desiring us to deepen our
relationship with You.   Through Your GOoDness, You provide two important means
to enhance our life with You.  You have revealed Yourself through Your Word,
especially</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Word Incarnate, Your Son, Jesus.  You have also taught
us how to pray and have encouraged us to pray continuously. Yet, we have often
spent more time pursuing earthly words and mere human relationships that are
not beneficial to being in touch with You.  We have used prayer as a tool to
try to get what we want, not a constant means of being in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>relationship with You.  Continue to pour out Your Holy
Spirit upon us that we might devote ourselves to those activities which bring
us closer to You and to Your holy people.  We make this prayer in union with
the Word Incarnate, Your Son, Jesus, Who has died, is risen, and is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 4: 20-25;     Luke 1: 69-70, 71-72,
73-75;       Luke 12: 13-21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“What really matters in life” is the central focus of our
readings today, as I reflect on the readings.  St. Paul in this part of his
Letter to the Romans speaks about the importance of faith in GOD and the divine
promises that GOD has made.  The Responsorial is Zechariah’s praise of GOD for
fulling the promises made to Abraham and his descendants.  In the Gospel Jesus
addresses the issue of wealth and possessions as being the wrong focus for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a person’s life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his Letter to the Romans, St. Paul continues to stress
the faith of Abraham.  Abraham did not always understand the “why” behind GOD’s
requests, but he believed, and did what was asked of him.  This became a source
of blessing not only for Abraham, but also for all of those who physically or
spiritually have descended from him.  Faith in GOD and the divine promises
reaches it climax in the coming of Jesus, His life and ministry, His death and
resurrection.  It is Jesus Who is the fulfillment of all the promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial today is part of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zechariah’s Benedictus.  As Zechariah</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sees the fulfillment of GOD’s promise to allow his elderly
wife (Elizabeth) to give birth to a son (John the Baptist) and as his tongue
(which had been silenced because of his earlier disbelief) is loosened, he
proclaims the blessedness of GOD Who is faithful to all the promises made to
Abraham and all of his descendants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel passage today begins with Jesus’ being asked to
settle an inheritance dispute.  Jesus uses the occasion to address the
misplaced focus people have on wealth and possessions.  If one is caught up in
seeking earthly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things, one can miss the most important aspect of human life
– preparing oneself for eternal life. Our attention should be on being with GOD
forever in the heavenly reign not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on amassing worldly treasures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I realize how easy it is
to get caught up in pursuing earthly values, whether they be money, fame,
possessions, or any other transient aspirations.  I know I become possessive of
things, wanting to hold onto items that have value to me.  I may not want a lot
of new items,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but I find it hard to throw away what I have.  This has
become very obvious to me when I had to discard the possessions of the woman
who passed away and for whom I cared and when I also to pack up some of my
parents’ possessions.  The woman (whose possessions I had to handle) had a lot
of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things in her house which were never even opened, some still
in the original packaging from the store, some with the price tags still
attached.  She did not take any of her accumulated items with her and left them
for me to dispense (either to others, to charitable organization, or to the
dumpster).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading today reminds us that what is most
important is to trust in GOD and the divine promises. GOD has promised us a
wealth that is beyond our wildest imaginations.  It is not material wealth, but
eternal life in the divine presence.  It is hard to focus on heavenly treasure
while we are surrounded by earthly possessions to which we become attached. 
Our world is constantly broadcasting messages that seek to keep our eyes
focused on the here and now.  The promises of an unending life, which is not in
this world, seem so far away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Abraham, the promises GOD made to him must have also
seemed nearly impossible.  GOD promised </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham a land and many descendants who would become a huge
nation.  The LORD GOD also said that all peoples and nations would be blessed
through a descendant of Abraham.  Abraham never saw that happen during his
sojourn on earth.  Oh, he may have seen his two grandsons (Jacob [Israel] and
Esau) being born, but he never saw the nation of Israel being formed.  His only
permanent land holding at the time of his death was the burial place he had
purchased for his wife and himself.  Yet, his faith in GOD’s promises was
credited to him as righteousness.  It was what motivated not only him, but also
his descendants.  The fullness of the promises did</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not reach its climax until centuries later with the birth of
Jesus.  And Jesus spoke of new and eternal place where all the multitudes of
GOD’s family would gather forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge for me today is to keep my focus on the Lord
Jesus and the promises that our faithful GOD has made.  It means living with
the conviction that life here and now on earth is not the most important thing
in the “Big Picture,” but my participation in the heavenly Reign of GOD is.  It
means living a life that is centered on what has been promised, not on the
things I now accumulate.  This is exactly what Zechariah was able to make the
focus of his prayer as he said, “This was the oath GOD swore to our ancestor
Abraham:  to set us free from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the hands of our enemies, free to worship the Lord without
fear, holy and righteous in GOD’s sight all the days of our life.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What items do I
treasure most in life?  Do I become obsessive about things? In what ways can I
simplify my life by letting go of things and focusing on the divine promises of
eternal life? How can I give witness to my attention to heavenly values as I
encounter people today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, of all promises.  Through Your
GOoDness, we are blessed with a richness beyond our human expectations and
understanding.  You have promised to give us eternal life in Your presence
forever.  Yet, because we sometimes cannot look beyond the here and now, we
have sought to amass all sorts of earthly wealth and fill our present lives
with things that have no lasting value.  For our failure to see with the eyes
of faith, we seek Your continued forgiveness and pardon.  You have continuously
spoken Your promises to us, reaching the fulness of those promises in the
coming of Your Son, Jesus.  He reiterated Your promises and continues to give
us signs of what lies in store for us if we but follow Him.  His whole earthly
mission was to present the GOoD News of Your promises in ways we could better
comprehend and accept.  His death and resurrection were proof that human death
is not the end of life but the transition to eternal life with Him and with
You.  We lift up this prayer of benediction (“Blessing”) to You as we focus on
the faith in Your promises, and as we unite ourselves with Jesus, Your Son and
our Brother, Who has died, is risen, and is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-hilarion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 5:12, 15b, 17-19, 20b-21;       Psalm 40:
7-8a, 8b-9, 10, 17;       Luke 12: 35-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our readings today, obedience is contrasted with
disobedience.  In the First Reading, St. Paul shows the difference between the
disobedience of Adam and the obedience of Jesus.  The psalm praises obedience
as being far superior to ritual sacrifices.  In the Gospel, Jesus urges His
disciples to be obedient and vigilant as they await the fulfillment of the
Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul describes how humanity was affected (negatively) by
the sin (disobedience) of Adam.  Yet, he goes on to say, that the obedience of
Jesus far surpasses the disobedience of Adam.  As I read the Greek text of
these verses from the fifth chapter of Paul’s Letter to the Romans, I am intrigued
by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>word which is translated as “many” in some translations – in
Greek it is πολλοὶ – polloi.  In the “many” translations it almost sounds like
not every one “died” because of the disobedience of Adam, and not everyone is
saved by the obedience of Jesus.  “Many” seems to imply “most, but not all.” 
The Greek word polloi can be translated as “the multitude” which would mean
everyone.  Thus, through the disobedient actions of Adam, death and sin entered
the world for all humans.  More importantly, however, through the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>obedient life and actions of Jesus, salvation was granted to
all.  The human disobedience is overshadowed by the divine-human obedience of
the Son of GOD.  All people have the opportunity to receive the abundant graces
that Jesus obtained by His submission to the will of His Abba-Father – even,
and especially, by His suffering and death, and His resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist reminds us that GOD desires our obedience to
the divine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will more than ritual ceremonies and sacrifices.  It is not
that rites and sacrificial offerings have no importance.  They do, as long as
it is done with the intention of being part of doing the will of GOD.  Yet if
all we are doing is performing certain actions that we choose, with no desire
to be obedient to the plan of GOD, then it is all just superstitious and/or
hypocritical activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus presents an imagery to His disciples. 
Just as the faithful, obedient, and vigilant servants are ready for their
master’s return whenever the master arrives, so His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>disciples must be ever ready to do GOD’s will and wait for
the second coming of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me about today’s readings is the perfect
example Jesus gives to us of how to be obedient to the will of GOD.  Jesus not
only tells His followers (including us) that obedience is important, He also
demonstrates what obedience means.  In His whole life, ministry, and especially
in His passion and death, Jesus always seeks to do what His Abba-Father
wishes.  I am particularly mindful of this as I reflect on Jesus’ agony in the
garden.  As He prepares to undergo His passion, He prays to His Abba saying,
“Abba, if it is possible that I do not have to drink of this cup [of suffering
and death]. . .But, not My will, but Yours be done” (Luke 22: 42).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is because Jesus is prepared for whatever His Abba asks
of Him, He could pray this prayer of total </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>obedience.  He manifests His complete unity with the will of
His Abba.  He also gives us the example that we should follow.  It is because
of His perfect obedience that He is able to undo not only the disobedience of
Adam, but of every other human who has ever lived, is living, or who will ever
live.  We are made right with GOD because of Jesus’ obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our obedience does not earn us justification, since our
disobedience (sins) break our relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is only Jesus’ perfect obedience that makes it possible
for us to be in relationship with GOD.  And our response to what Jesus has done
should be our seeking to be obedient to GOD.  When we understand our obedience
to GOD as a sign of our gratitude for what the obedience of Jesus has done for
us, it is then that we show our joyful appreciation to the Lord Jesus and His
Abba and can voice the words of the psalmist today, “To do Your will, O my GOD,
is my delight, and Your law is within my heart. . .And may those who love Your
salvation, say ever,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘The LORD be glorified.’”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What does it mean
to me to be obedient to GOD?  Do I see obedience as the means of receiving
GOD’s graciousness or as the response to already receiving GOD’s graciousness. 
In what area of my life do I find obedience the most difficult? How can my
interaction with others manifest my obedience to GOD’s will? Is there anything
I can do to help others be more obedient to the will of the Lord Jesus as a
sign of their acceptance of GOD’s gracious righteousness and salvation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all graces.  Through Your
GOoDness and the obedience of Your Son, we are granted the gift of forgiveness
for our disobedience.  Yet, when we are disobedient and sinful, we have
demonstrated our lack of appreciation for what Jesus has gained for us by His
perfect obedience, even unto His death on the cross.  As we continue our
journey to You, fill us with the graces that flow from Your Holy Spirit. Give
us wisdom, courage, and strength to respond to Your kindness by seeking to do
Your will in our lives. Inspire us to offer to You our sacrifice of obedient
service and love.  We make this prayer in the name of Your perfectly obedient
Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who willingly came to earth,
proclaimed Your GOoD News, demonstrated His obedience, suffered and died, but
Who is risen and living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Paul II:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-paul-ii</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 6: 12-18;       Psalm 124: 1b-3, 4-6,
7-8;         Luke 12: 39-48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, we are challenged to examine who or what is the
master of our lives.  In our First Reading, St. Paul describes two contrasting
individuals, one who is the slave of sin and the other who is a servant of
GOD.  The Responsorial Psalm focuses on what GOD has done to free us from
slavery, allowing us to become servants of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus describes
the GOoD servant as the one who is always conscious of what the Master wants
and seeks to do the GOoD thing even when the Master is not present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In an expansion of a theme used elsewhere in his letter to
Romans, Paul describes the person who is a slave to the law and therefore a
slave to sin.  It is only with the coming of Jesus and His obedience to His
Abba-Father, that we have been set free from sin and free from slavery to the
law.  Yet that does not mean we have free reign to do whatever we want.  We are
called to be obedient servants of GOD through our service to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist realizes that if it were</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not for the hand of GOD acting on the people’s behalf, the
people would still be in slavery under their oppressors.  What</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has done is set the people free to live a new and better
life, just as an animal who is freed from a trap experiences a new sense of
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus desires that His disciples be vigilant
and prepared for whatever comes.  They must be like GOoD servants who do the
will of the Master even when the Master has gone away for a while.  The
unfaithful servant only performs selfish acts in the absence of the Master. 
The Master, however, will come at a time when the unfaithful servant will not
be expecting.  The GOoD servant is always living and acting as if the Master is
about to return at any moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the second part of today’s Gospel, Jesus, in a related
pericope, describes the accountability that will be asked of all.  Those to
whom much has been given, will be held more responsible for their use, or
misuse, of the gifts given to them by the Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that my response (to
all the gifts with which GOD has blessed me) should be to live as a faithful
servant. There is a big difference between a servant and a slave.  A slave is
one who is forced to do what the master wants, and therefore, when the master
is away, the slave does not work.  A servant chooses to be of service to the
Master.  Those who have fallen under the control of the law, of sin, or of
worldly ways, will be forced to do things against their desires, for they are
slaves of the wicked, and of the controlling masters</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>they have been raised over themselves.  They are trapped by
their circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As St. Paul reminds the Romans (and us), all who have
accepted Jesus have been set free from the bondage to the law, to sin, and to
worldly ways.  We are called to be faithful servants of the Lord Jesus. 
Service should be the hallmark of our lives.  We serve the Lord Jesus by being
of service to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As one looks at her/his life, it is sometimes easy to see
who or what is in control.  Those who are addicted to drugs or alcohol are not
free to live the life that GOD intends.  They have sold themselves out to their
habit.  All </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>their waking moments, and even their dreams, are plagued
with false promises and a need to serve their master (drugs, alcohol, etc.). 
It is not, however, just the drug junkie who has lost their freedom.  People
who are so wrapped up in their desire for wealth, power, pleasure, or fame are
also slaves to their passions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am coming to believe more and more that it is when we are
willing to let go of everything and experience the freedom that comes from
being a servant of the Lord Jesus that we really begin to understand what it is
to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>free.  Serving others and helping those who need our caring
is very liberating.  We sense a new emancipation, for we are not bound by the
restrictions of our worries and bad habits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the true life stories that I have heard
about individuals.  The stories deal with people who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>had been in the captivity of bad habits.  Once they
experience the gift of freedom that GOD gives them, they seek to help other
addicted people be set free from their restrictive behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to realize that true freedom is a gift from
GOD.  It has been given to us by the Suffering Servant, Jesus.  Through His
obedience to His Abba, He has set us free.  He has broken the bonds of sin,
death, and the restrictiveness of the law.  Our response to our freedom is to
let others experience that same freedom by serving them.  It is in our freely
given ministry (service) to others that we proclaim what GOD has done for us. 
It is then that we can echo the words of the psalmist and say, “We were rescued
like a bird from the fowlers’ snare; broken was the snare, and we were freed. 
Our help is in the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  To what or to whom
am I enslaved? How does that prevent me from living the life of one who has
been set free by the Lord Jesus?  Am I willing to choose to be a servant of the
Lord Jesus? How can I be of service to others to show my willingness to be the
Lord Jesus’ servant?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of freedom.  Through Your
GOoDness You have gifted us with a profound sense of freedom – freedom from
sin, freedom from eternal death, freedom from the bondage that strict adherence
to the law can bring.  Through Jesus, You have shown us what that freedom means
– the ability to freely give ourselves in service of others as a response to
what You have done for us, especially in and through Jesus, Your Son.  At
times, we have stayed in our bondage to sin.  Yet, through Your mercy, You
continue to extend Your forgiveness and freedom to us so that we might then
share the GOoD News of salvation with others. By the power of Your indwelling
Holy Spirit, continue to inspire us to follow the lead of our Master-Teacher,
Jesus, Who came to freely and lovingly give Himself in the service of others. 
We make this prayer in His name, for He is Your Son and our Brother, our Savior
and Redeemer, Who has died, but is risen and living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John of Capistrano:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-of-capistrano</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 6: 19-23;            Psalm 1: 1-2, 3, 4
and 6;            Luke 12: 49-53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Following Jesus is not an easy thing.  St. Paul reminds us
that it is worth the effort because the consequences of being unfaithful (that
is, sinning) is death, whereas the consequences of being faithful is eternal
life.  The psalm is reminder that trusting in the LORD leads to a life filled
with growth.  The Gospel presents Jesus’ warning that being His disciple can
lead to division, even within one’s own family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Continuing the imagery of slavery to sin leading to death,
and believers being set free from sin through Jesus, St. Paul reminds the
Christian Romans (and us) that the freedom they and we have as believers is a
gift from GOD, and not any of our doing.  We can claim sin as something for
which we are responsible, but eternal life has been gifted to us through Jesus. 
We can accept the gift and then live a life that reflects the gift we have
received.  The comparison, that may be lost in our modern age, is to a slave. 
Slaves cannot free themselves.  Freedom comes as a gift from their master who
releases them.  Once they have been released from their slavery, they are asked
to live lives that reflect the freedom they have been given.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The imagery used by the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>psalmist of those who trust in the LORD is that of a tree
that is deeply</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rooted near a source of water.  Since the tree is able to
draw water from its deep roots, it is able to survive whatever comes its way
and produce a harvest at all times.  The analogy is a reminder that those who
sink their faith-roots deeply through their trust in GOD will be able to survive
no matter what is happening in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus reminds His disciples that following
Him will lead to conflict and division.  Families will be divided with some
people being faithful and others being unfaithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, what strikes me most is the
imagery used in the psalm.  It reminds me that we must be radical.  The word
“radical”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>comes from the Latin word, radix, radicis, which means
“root.”  We must be rooted in our relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  It is only when we are able to sink our roots deeply
into the place where there is the living water (into the gift of GOD) that we
will be able to be sustained when hot weather, storms, or other challenges come
our way.  Jesus (in the Gospel) reminds us that we will face trying times, even
from members of our own family or friends.  The only thing that will allows us
to bear GOoD fruit is being radical – rooted in the Lord Jesus. And even that
is not something that is our doing – it is a gift from GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other analogy (that of the slave being set free), which
Paul uses in the First Reading, is also powerful.  We are slaves to our own
vices –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sins.  We cannot free ourselves, just as slaves of old had
no power to free themselves from their masters.  Yet freedom can be given as a
gift,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sometimes a gift that comes with a very costly price in
personal terms for the master.  Sometimes, it was known to happen, that one
master buys slaves from their former masters for the sole (soul) purpose of
setting the slaves free.  The more that the slaves were indebted to the former,
evil task masters, the more the freeing master had to pay in order to give
freedom to the slaves.  The gift of our soul’s freedom came at a very costly
price for our new </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Master, Who has died in order to set us free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our response to the living water and the ability to sink our
roots (hope and trust) in GOD should be bearing the best harvest (the harvest
of the Holy Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, GOoDness,
humility, self-control) we can, in spite of the opposition we face.  It is then
that we show that we have accepted the new life of freedom that is ours because
of the price that our new Master has paid through His death and resurrection. 
Let us turn to GOD with the confidence of the psalmist today and proclaim, “The
LORD watches over the ways of the just.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:    To what “evil
task master” have I been enslaved?   What is my response to the new Master Who
has paid the price for my freedom?  How can I sink my roots more deeply into
living water flowing from the Lord Jesus?   What aspects of the harvest of the
Holy Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, GOoDness,
humility, self-control) will I bear so that others can taste of the GOoDness of
the Lord Jesus and begin to accept the freedom that He has won and given to
them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all life.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have the ability to produce the GOoD harvest of the Holy Spirit. 
All that we do is only possible when we sink our roots deeply into the living
waters that You have given us.  At times, we have let sin rule our lives and
lead us away from You and toward eternal death.  We seek Your pardon and
peace.  With the inspiration that comes from Your Holy Spirit, helps us to
focus on the life that Your Son has given us through His living out Your GOoD
News in His earthly life, ministry, His death, and resurrection.  We lift this
prayer to You in and through Your Son, Jesus, Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 7: 18-25a;       Psalm 119: 66, 68, 76,
77, 93, 94;        Luke 12: 54-59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind us that following the way of GOD is not
always easy, since we are facing evil opposition. The passage of St. Paul’s
Letter to the Romans speaks of how evil can control lives.  The psalm is a hymn
of praise for the guidance GOD has given to people so that they can do the
correct thing.  In the Gospel, Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>warns His disciples, and all people, to pay attention to the
signs that are present and that speak of the coming of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s judgment and the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul’s words today probably ring true for most people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There seems to be a power inside of us that draws us to do
what we know is wrong and avoid doing what we know is right.  It is the force
of evil.  As humans and descendants of the first sinful people, we have a
native proclivity to sin.  If left to ourselves, we would succumb to sin and be
overpowered by it.  There is GOoD News, however.  In and through Jesus, we have
been empowered to do the right thing as we accept the gifts that He gave to us
through His ministry, life, death, and resurrection!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psalm 119 proclaims the value of GOD’s rules and ordinance.
They are what keep us on the right track.  If we use them as our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>guides (and not become slaves to them), we will be able to
walk with the knowledge of GOD’s love for us.  Again, they do not make us GOoD,
but allow us to act out the GOoDness that only GOD can give to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus chides His listeners because they are
aware of natural patterns, but they have failed to see the supernatural
patterns of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD and to pay attention to the signs that point to a
relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus has come to reveal the plan of GOD, but people have
misinterpreted the signs (miracles and teachings) that He brought and performed
and spoke.  The second part of today’s Gospel is a warning to take care of
things now, before they progress to a further state from which it will be hard
to get back on track.  Just as it is sometimes better to solve an issue with
one’s opposition before it ends up in court, so it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is important that people heed the warnings of impending doom
before the doom overcomes the persons and they cannot get back on the GOoD
path.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that we are caught
up in a constant struggle in following the ways of the Lord Jesus.  Doing the
right thing is difficult.  Doing the wrong thing is quite appealing at times
and easy to give into.  Some philosophers would say we are drawn to the
apparent “good,” which is not “GOoD” at all.  We are deceived (by “the
deceiver”) into thinking that what looks “attractive” or “pleasurable” is
“good.”  Yet, as with the fishing lure, there are barbs and hooks in that which
attracts us and we end up getting “hooked” and reeled into where GOD would not
have us be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In and of ourselves, it is impossible to win our freedom
from evil.  We do not have the strength or ability to overcome the “prince of
lies” and “master of deceit.”  GOD, however, wants us to be in the divine
presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, GOD first gave guidelines and rules to those who
have been chosen.  These regulations where to help people keep their eyes
focused on GOD.  Yet, true to the nature and plan of the “deceiver,” people
were led into misinterpretations of GOD’s plan.  Individuals made the
humanization of the divine commandments ends-unto- themselves, rather than guideposts
to developing a closer relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the fullness of time, GOD sent the Son to proclaim the
perfect plan of salvation and provide the power to overcome evil.  It would not
come without a cost, though.  Jesus not only had to demonstrate that being
loved by GOD is the force that can enable a person to live a GOoD life and help
avoid the entrapments of evil.  Jesus also had to destroy evil and its most
profound repercussion (death), by laying down His own life and rising from the
dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is only with the loving, selfless act of Jesus on the
cross and from the tomb that the forces of evil have been overcome.  The
victory of the war has been won.  There are still battles going on, even though
the final outcome has been assured.  We are the people on the front lines,
continuing the struggle, day in and day out, against the forces of evil and of
the “evil one.”  We have been given the weapons and armor that will enable us
to claim the victory that has already been won (Ephesians 6: 10-18).  We may
end up being hurt in the process, but the final results are not in doubt. 
Jesus has overcome the enemy, and we just need to accept (and live out) the
victory that He has won.  What is most important is that we surrender not to
the enemy, but to the GOD Who saves (Jesus = Yeshua = “GOD saves”).  That is
the message of the psalmist today who says, “I am Yours, [O GOD,] save me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Is there some
particular area in my life in which I struggle to do what I know I should do,
but find myself not doing it? Knowing that St. Paul also struggled in a similar
type of way, am I bolstered to turn to the Lord Jesus, as Paul did? How can I
claim the victory over evil that Jesus has already won, even while I am still
fighting a battle against evil in my personal life? How can I help reassure
others of the ultimate victory that has come through Jesus (Jesus = Yeshua =
“GOD saves”)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of the ultimate victory.  Through
Your GOoDness we have been invited to be on the winning team.  Problems still
face us.  The “ultimate loser” wants to win us over to his side so that he can
have company in his defeat and misery.  At times we have given into the deceits
and lies that the enemy has place before us.  We have given into selfish ways
and sinned.  We call upon Your mercy and forgiveness that You have demonstrated
through the life, death, and resurrection of Your Son, Jesus.  It was through
these very acts that Jesus won the ultimate victory, not for Himself, but for all
of us who place our trust in Him.  Through the continued outpouring of Your
Holy Spirit, inspire us to keep our eyes focused on the Victory Banquet that
Jesus has prepared for us.  Empower us to do what is right in response to the
selfless acts of love that He has performed for us.  We surrender to You, to
Jesus, and to Your Holy Spirit.  To You be all glory, honor and praise, as we
lift this prayer in the name of Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who has died, is
risen, and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-antonio-de-santanna-galvao</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 8: 1-11;          Psalm 24: 1b-2, 3-4ab,
5-6;           Luke 13: 1-9</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The patience and forgiveness of GOD take center stage in the
readings.  St. Paul reminds his readers that things are different now for those
who are “in Christ Jesus.”  They now live by the Spirit.  The psalmist mentions
that those who seek the face of GOD will be blessed.  Jesus, in the Gospel,
first mentions that events (whether they be GOoD or bad) that come upon people
are not the result of GOD’s hatred or judgment for or against individuals.  GOD
loves all people.  In the second part of today’s Gospel reading, Jesus
reassures His listeners that GOD is patient and will allow people even more
time to repent and grow in the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Readings is the beginning of my favorite
chapter in all of St. Paul’s epistles/letters.  Paul speaks about the power of
life in the Spirit. Before the coming of Jesus, people lived by the flesh. 
Their actions were motivated by their carnal and worldly desires.  With the
coming of Jesus and the sending of the Holy Spirit, people are now enlivened by
GOD’s Spirit. Living according to the flesh can only end in frustration and
death.  Living according to the Holy Spirit leads to peace and eternal life
with GOD.  It is GOD’s Spirit indwelling within the believer that enables the
believer to experience not only life here on earth, but to be raised up with
Jesus to eternal life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist reminds the people that GOD has made the divine
presence felt throughout all creation.  Those people who respond to GOD’s gift
live lives that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>allow them to feel blessed to be in GOD’s presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus recalls the death of some Galileans and
some people who lived near Siloam in Jerusalem.  Some of Jesus’ audience were
blaming these deaths on the lifestyle lived by those who died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus remarks that GOD desires all to repent and experience
life.  In the following verses, Jesus shares a parable that reminds His
disciples that GOD is patient in forgiving and will give the wayward and
non-productive another chance, especially if others intercede on their behalf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Repeatedly reading over the eighth chapter of Romans, I am
reminded again and again that GOD desires to share eternal life with people. 
GOD does not want to condemn anyone.  Yes, being a just and equitable GOD, GOD
will grant the wishes of those who desire to have nothing to do with GOD. 
Since some choose not to be a part of GOD in this life, GOD will allow them to
experience the absence of the divine presence for all eternity, but that is not
what GOD wants.  As we focus on what GOD has done in and through Jesus and the
Holy Spirit, we can only be impressed with how much GOD loves us and wants us
to accept all the gifts that are offered to us.  With the acceptance of the
gifts comes the ability to live in a way that gives glory to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue (next week) with this powerful chapter in
Paul’s letter to the Romans, we will be reminded of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how far GOD has gone to save us.  All we need do is turn our
attention more fully to the Lord Jesus and seek to view GOD’s face.  That is
what the psalmist shares with us in the words, “One shall receive a blessing
from the LORD, a reward from GOD the savior.  Such is the race that seeks for
GOD, that seeks the face of the GOD of Jacob.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What does it mean
to me to live in the Spirit rather than to live in the flesh?  How can I show
my acceptance of the gift of living in the Spirit?  In what ways have I
experienced the patient forgiveness and understanding of GOD? Is there any way
that I can help others become more aware of GOD’s desire that they live more
fully the life that GOD wishes them to live?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all kindness.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have been offered the gift of eternal life with You.  We have
sometimes chosen to live the life of the flesh and travel the paths that lead
to frustration and death.  Through Your Son and the working of Your Holy
Spirit, You continue to remind us that You desire to have us join You for all
eternity.  You do not desire to condemn us for our wrongdoing, but to forgive
us and let us experience Your love.  May we keep our eyes on Your loving
kindness, and praise Your glory not only now, but also for all eternity.  We
make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who has died
to save us, has risen to bring us life, and is living and reigning with You and
the Holy Spirit, Who together are our one and only GOD and Who have prepared a
place for us, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Peter of Alcantara: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-peter-of-alcantara</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Sirach 35: 12-14, 16-18;     Psalm 34: 2-3, 17-18,
19, 23     2 Timothy 4: 6-8, 16-18;      Luke 18: 9-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The LORD hears the prayer of the humble-hearted. The First
Reading reminds us that even though GOD plays no favorites, the LORD seems to
be more attentive to those who humbly admit that they need GOD’s help. The
Responsorial rephrases that theme in saying that “The LORD hears the cry of the
poor.” In this last chapter of St. Paul’s letter to Timothy (which is our
Second Reading today), Paul reviews his ministry and humbly proclaims that he
has finished the race and kept the faith, and he awaits GOD to bestow the crown
of righteousness on him, even if others of the faithful people seemed to have
deserted him. In the Gospel, Jesus shares the parable of two individuals who
come into GOD’s presence and pray. Jesus remarks that the humble prayer of the
tax collector is heard while the proud prayer of the Pharisees is not heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the typical style of the Wisdom Books, today’s reading
from Sirach states a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>truth which at first seems contradictory. He proclaims that
GOD shows no partiality in answering prayer, yet at the same time GOD always
hears the humble prayer of those who cry out to GOD in need. The LORD hears all
authentic prayer. GOD responds to all true prayers, maybe not exactly as they
are presented, but in a way that is a true blessing for the “pray-er” – the one
who prays. The LORD does not turn away from the sincere prayer of those who
acknowledge their need before GOD, while those who selfishly request things
from GOD do not always have their prayers answered, at least not in the way
they want. The key to this paradoxical theme is in the attitude of the one who
prays. Those who can honestly admit their need for GOD’s help will receive it,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>while those who only perfunctorily call upon GOD receive
responses in proportion to their acknowledgment of GOD’s ability to help them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist presents this same theme by pointing out that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD confronts the evil doers while reaching out the divine
hand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to help those who seek GOD with sincere hearts. The LORD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hears the cry – the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pleading – of those who know that GOD is the Only One Who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>can touch their lives with healing and well-being (salus).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul concludes his pastoral letter to Timothy by
reflecting on his ministry that is drawing to an end. Paul has striven to do
his best in what GOD has set him apart to do – announcing the GOoD News to
others. Paul has exerted himself just as a runner in a race pushes himself to
the extreme in order to cross the finish line. Paul knows what awaits him when
he crosses the line from this life to the next. He realizes that it is not his
doing nor the help that he sometimes failed to receive from others. It is the
Lord Jesus Who has stood by him, giving him strength and Who will ultimate
receive all the glory and praise that is due for calling and urging Paul on to
win the unfading crown of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus presents a parable to those who proudly
think that they are above the rest of humanity. According to Jesus’ telling of
the parable, two individuals enter the Temple to pray. The first one is a </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pharisee who boastfully sees himself better than all other
people, especially better than the sinful tax collector. After all, the
Pharisee publicly does everything by the letter of the law so that he can be
admired for his righteousness. The Pharisee does not really need GOD’s help
since he is already justified in his own mind. Yes, it would be nice if GOD
would agree with him, but even that is not necessary. The tax collector on the
other hand humbly and contritely admits that he is in need of GOD’s help and
forgiveness. He is a sinner who needs GOD’s spiritual healing. He can honestly
confess that he is not perfect and wants a better relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am challenged to look at my
own relationship with GOD – my prayer life – and see what is my attitude when I
am aware of GOD as I enter the presence of the Lord Jesus through prayer. At
times I have come with an attitude of superiority and self-righteousness. I
have turned to GOD in prayer, hoping that GOD would pat me on the back and say,
“Great job!”  My attitude has been prideful. I figure that I am doing GOD a
favor by my turning to the Lord Jesus in prayer.  I have been no better than
the arrogant Pharisee in the parable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There have been other times when I have been knocked off my
pedestal by physical or emotional or spiritual</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>challenges. It is then that I have had to humbly come into
GOD’s presence, acknowledging Who GOD is and how much I am in need of GOD’s
help. It is often at those time that I sense a closeness in my relationship
with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The focus of prayer should be to admit our dependence on
GOD. Yes, we should do all that we can do – with GOD’s help. Yet even as we do
our best, we must humbly admit that it is GOD Who has empowered us, just as the
Lord Jesus strengthened and provided for Paul throughout his ministry. Yes, we
must all exert ourselves and run toward the finish line, always conscious that
it is GOD Who has equipped us with energy and ability to cross the line. And if
we fall as we run the race, it is important that we turn to the One Who can
help us back up and get us headed in the right direction. We must constantly
keep in the front of our mind for Whom we are running the race and Who it is
Who makes it all possible. It is then that we can give GOD all the praise,
thanks, and glory as we echo the words of the psalmist today: “The LORD redeems
the lives of the servants of GOD; no one incurs guilt who takes refuge in the
LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What has been my attitude
when I pray? Do I use the words “I” and “me” and “mine” more than I do “You,
Lord” and “Your divine will”? How can I more humbly come into GOD’s presence
admitting my need for GOD’s help? In what part of the race am I at this point
in my life and how can I keep the faith more fully as I run toward the finish
line?   Are there people who are running along with me that need words of
encouragement as they struggle to keep going? What can I do to show that I am
concerned for them and that I am there for them, as a reminder that GOD is with
them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, the One Who empowers and gives
strength to those who are running the race of faith. Through Your GOoDness, You
answer all who humbly turn to You, seeking Your help. You are always ready to
help people get back on their feet, especially as they have fallen off the
right track. For the times we have lost sight of the finish line either by
thinking we had already arrived on our own, or given up because we have not
seen any possibility of finishing, we ask for Your continued forgiveness and
strength. We thank You for sending us Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Son, Jesus, as the Master-Teacher-Coach, Who has given us
the example and continues to urge us on. We also thank You for the gifts that
come from Your Holy Spirit, especially the gifts of humility, endurance,
patience, and fortitude. May we continue to give You all the glory and honor as
we draw ever nearer to You at the finish line. We make this prayer in the name
of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who has died, is risen, and is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Bartholomew of Vicenza:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-bartholomew-of-vicenza</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 8: 12-17;        Psalm 68: 2 and 4, 6-7ab,
20-21;         Luke 13: 10-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings focus on the freedom that comes from being
an adopted daughter or son of GOD.  St. Paul addresses the faithful in Rome and
reminds them that they have been adopted by GOD.  The Responsorial psalm speaks
of GOD as the Father (Abba) of orphans and the defender of widows.  In the
Gospel, Jesus extends salus (healing, wholeness) to a “daughter of Abraham,” or
better put, a “daughter of GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul is quite emphatic in his assertion that believers
are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>truly children of GOD.  Because the Holy Spirit has entered
into a person (beginning especially at baptism), an individual becomes a
daughter or son of GOD.  Adopted children are raised from their former ranks of
being a slave and are given the full rights belonging to the family.  They are
heirs to the inheritance of the Parent.  Since we have become daughters and
sons of GOD, we are truly GOD’s children and have the rights to inherit all
that GOD has – the divine Reign.  We have a close, personal relationship with
GOD.  It is not just that GOD is our Master and we are GOD’s slaves or
servants.  We are truly part of the family of GOD.  Yes, family members do have
responsibilities to the other family members.  The duties we have should not be
considered forced (as if we were slaves), but willingly undertaken</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because the other family members are our sisters and
brothers, co-heirs of the Reign with us.  Even our outreach to those who have
not yet accepted GOD as their Abba-Father should be in a loving way with the
hope that they will desire to be part of the family of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist declares that GOD cares for the oppressed and
outcasts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>because GOD is their loving Parent (Abba).  This closeness
and the love that GOD has for the lowly should lead us to rejoice that GOD is a
loving Provider and Protector.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the Gospel passage unfolds, Jesus extends compassion to a
woman who has been suffering for many years.  He sees her as one who needs the
salus which He has come to bring.  He wants her to be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>set free from the physical bondage (illness) to which she
has been enslaved for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>eighteen years.  Jesus reaches out and cures her.  This
action would be considered as work by the legalistic Jews, and therefore since
healing is something not allowed on the Sabbath, Jesus is “sinning.”  Jesus
points out how some of the “legalists” bend the law in order to take care of
their bound animals on the Sabbath and set them free and provide water for
them.  Jesus remarks that this daughter of Abraham (and therefore daughter of
GOD) should be accorded a similar deed of kindness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD loves us so much that GOD wants to share the divine
Reign with us.  GOD does not just want us to be a part of the Reign in some
subservient role (slave of the Master), but as co-heirs of the fullness of the
Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, GOD, through the Only Begotten Son and the Holy
Spirit, has made us sons and daughters.  As GOD’s children, we are entitled to
whatever belongs to our Abba-Father-Daddy-Loving Parent.  It also deepens our
relationship not only with our Abba, but also with our brother, Jesus, and through
Him with all the other adopted </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>children of GOD, our sisters and brothers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With our adoption as children of GOD, our roles and
responsibilities change.  More importantly, our attitude toward those
responsibilities should change.  We used to have a duty to care for others
because we were slaves. We were forced to be caring (and being forced, we
sometimes did not live up to our roles).  Now, we are members of the same
family, with equal rights (and duties) and we should want to help our sisters
and brothers in any way we can.  Our loving care changes from obligation to
desire.  We should desire to be of assistance to our sisters and brothers (and
future or potential siblings) in whatever way possible.  This should come from
a realization that the more of us who are part of Reign of GOD, the richer we
will be.  Some people may say (selfishly) that if there are more heirs, we will
inherit less.  As more and more children take their share in the Reign of GOD,
GOD’s joyful riches multiply instead of divide.  That is because the
inheritance of the divine Reign is centered on relationships – relationship
with the Triune GOD and with all of GOD’s children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our journey to the eternal home of our Abba
Who happens to be GOD, let us willingly and lovingly do all we can to share in
the joys of our inheritance and welcome more sisters and brothers into our
family by reaching out in loving service.  That is when we will be able to
proclaim the psalmist’s words today: “those who have been justified, rejoice and
exult before GOD; they are glad and rejoice.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What implications
do I see in being a child of GOD rather than a slave?  How does being a co-heir
of the Reign of GOD affect my relationship with the other co-heirs? How can I
better live out my privilege and obligations as a child of GOD? What can I do
to help others seek to be part of the family of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of love.  Through Your GOoDness,
You have brought us into Your Reign, not just as servants, but as Your adopted
daughters and sons.  You have made this possible through the life and ministry,
death and resurrection of Your Son, Who empowered us to call upon You as our
Abba-Father-Loving Parent, and to call upon Him as our Brother.  At times we
have not taken our privilege and responsibilities seriously and have only
focused on our selfish desires.  For those times, we seek Your pardon and
forgiveness. Continue to implant Your Holy Spirit within us so that we can live
out our calling as Your sons and daughters. We make this prayer in the name of
Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who has gone before us to lead us to Your
heavenly home where we will enjoy the inheritance of Your Reign.  It is this
Jesus Who is our Master-Teacher and Savior, and Who is living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we celebrate in honor of the memory of two of the
twelve apostles.  In the scriptures, little is known of Jude and Simon other
than their names (and nicknames) being included in the list of the twelve
apostles.  The readings would have us reflect on the role of the apostle – that
of being “sent out” to continue the work of Jesus. St. Paul speaks about the
role of the apostles as part of the foundation of the structure known as the
Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is the common one used on feasts of apostles.  It
mentions that the message of GOD is to be proclaimed throughout all the earth. 
The Gospel pictures Jesus (after a night in prayer) calling forth the chosen
twelve apostles.  Included in the twelve are Jude (also known as Judas or
Thaddeus in two of the other Gospels, son of a James) and Simon (referred to as
“a Zealot”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, the position of the twelve apostles was important
in the early Church.  The apostles had a special role since they were
“eye-witnesses” of the ministry and life of Jesus.  They were the first
missionaries.  (Both the word “missionary” and “apostle” have the root meaning
of “being sent.”)  Thus, it is that St. Paul calls them the foundation of the
Church.  Upon them and their teaching, the spread of Christianity depended. 
The Church has as one of its four “marks” that it is apostolic – that is, built
upon the shoulders or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>foundation of the apostles.  Besides the foundation stones
of the Apostles,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus is the cornerstone, keystone, and capstone of edifice
of the Church, all of which are associated with Jesus, upon whom the rest of
the building (the Church) depends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm describes the function of the apostolic (which
includes the modern) community of believers: to declare the glory of GOD and
let its message be proclaimed throughout the world.  The fact is that Jesus
commissioned the twelve apostles to spread the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD News to all corners (north, south, east, and west) of
the world and this “being sent forth” is seen as the purpose of the Church.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s Gospel begins by stating that Jesus spends the night
in prayer.  The responsibility of choosing the correct apostles is important. 
Yes,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>even the choice of Judas, the betrayer, is all part of GOD’s
plan.  Jesus confers with His Abba-Father before publicly announcing the
twelve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder the readings for today’s Feast of Saints Simon
and Jude,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am once again reminded of the role of each believer.  Each
of us is called to continue the work of the apostolic Church.  That includes
two very important aspects: 1) being grounded and rooted in the biblical and apostolic
tradition of the twelve apostles, with our foundation (cornerstone), keystone,
and capstone (holding it all together) being Jesus; and 2) continuing to be
missionaries by going out to the corners of our personal world and announcing
the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important for me to realize that I am not a solo
proclaimer of GOD’s message.  I have not had a personal revelation from GOD. 
Rather, I am part of a tradition that goes back through the apostolic Church to
Jesus and the Word of GOD as proclaimed in holy scripture.  That means that I
cannot “invent” new teachings about GOD. My belief and my sharing of the Gospel
cannot be simply my personal thinking.  I must be rooted in the Truth Who is
Jesus.  I can look not only to Jesus’ own words, but also to the inspired Word
of the Bible (both Hebrew and Christian Scriptures [Old Testament and New
Testament]).  I must also be aware of how the Word of GOD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has been passed down through the centuries and presented by
people of faith before me.  I must be as informed as I can be about scripture
and its interpretation.  Yes, I can share my thoughts and reflections on the
Word, but I must always explain from where my thoughts come:  scripture itself,
the teaching authority of the Church (tradition), or my personal ponderings.  I
must never pass off my personal reflections as equal to, or even somewhat as
valuable as, the Word of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Secondly, I must continue the work of the apostles.  I am
called to be a missionary also.  The world to which I must preach may not be as
widespread as Paul’s or Peter’s, or Simon’s or Jude’s.  Yet, I must</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>realize that I have been commissioned – “sent out” – to
spread the GOoD News to the people to whom GOD has sent me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am aware of both these aspects of my being “apostolic.” 
1) in my writing these reflections, I realize how I must proclaim the GOoD
News, being sure that I let those who read the reflections have some idea of
when I am speaking the “Word of GOD” or the teaching of the Church, and when I
am sharing my personal thoughts and ideas.  2) I also realize that my
missionary work includes reaching out to others throughout the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>world by sharing my reflections.  Every day, I have about a
thousand people to whom I send the reflections or who read the reflections at
my website.  I am reaching out to all I can, even though I have not been out of
my home turf as much for over the past three and half years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This applies not only to me, but also to all who are a part
of the Body of Christ, the Church.  Each of us is standing on the shoulders of
the apostles and their successors.  We must be sure we are firmly rooted in
where we have come from and we are prepared to support those who will stand on
our shoulders.  This is the way the Church continues to be apostolic –
missionary.  To use a catch phrase of the last few years, we are, individually
and collectively called to be “missionary (or ‘missonal’) disciples.”  And in
this way, the psalm response from today will apply to us as much as it has
applied to those who came before us:  “Their message goes out throughout all
the world,” or paraphrased, “The Message goes out throughout all the world
through their/our proclaiming the Word.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I fit into
the apostolic Church? What is my “mission” – to whom am I being sent – at this
point in my life so that I can proclaim the GOoD News in word and in action?
How can I better prepare myself to announce the Word of GOD to others?  How can
I present my own thoughts in a way that shows their connection to, and
submission to, the Word of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever wise and all powerful. 
Through Your GOoDness, and through Your Son You have chosen to continue the
spread of the GOoD News by those who are sent out.  We thank You for choosing
the original twelve “apostles” and for having Jesus send them out to all the
world.  We have been blessed by their missionary actions, for we are built upon
the foundation of the apostles.  We thank You also for allowing us to share in
the apostolic ministry of the Church, as missionary (“missional”) disciples. 
Through</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the power of Your Holy Spirit – the gift that/Whom Jesus has
left us – may we be faithful to Your Word and to those who have passed down its
authentic meaning to us.  May we take seriously our role in being part of the
Church, with Jesus as our Cornerstone, Keystone, and Capstone.  We ask this of
You in the name of Jesus, You Son, our Master-Teacher, and Guide, Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 8: 26-30;         Psalm 13: 4-5,
6;          Luke 13: 22-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s plans will not only come about, but they will come
about for the GOoD of those who seek GOD’s will in their lives.  St. Paul
reminds the Romans that all things work together for the GOoD of those who seek
GOD’s will.  The Responsorial Psalm is a prayer of hope in the GOoD that GOD
does for those who trust in GOD.  In</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Gospel, Jesus reminds His listeners that being part of
the Reign of GOD is much more than a passing association with Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In probably my favorite passage in his writing, St. Paul
presents the notion that GOD has a plan that will work out for our GOoD, if we
continue to trust in the Lord Jesus.  We, with our meager human minds, cannot
comprehend fully what GOD’s plan is.  Even when we pray, we cannot pray properly
without the guidance and direction of the Holy Spirit.  When we invoke the Holy
Spirit, we not only pray in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accordance with GOD’s will, we also can accept that GOD can
make GOoD things come out of the most trying and difficult situations.  That is
because we have been invited to share in the life of the Only Begotten Son,
Jesus.  If we accept GOD’s invitation, we become one with our Brother Jesus and
things will fall into place for the ultimate glorification of GOD (and
therefore, by inheritance, our GOoD).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist prays that GOD would be present during the
difficult happenings of his life.  Trusting in GOD leads to GOoDness in life,
even in the midst of the most challenging events.  We are called to praise
GOD’s GOoDness in all things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus continues His journey to Jerusalem, He encounters
individuals who think they have it made because they are members of the Jewish
nation.  They believe that since they are part of the Chosen People that GOD is
obligated to take care of them.  Jesus tells them that they may belong to the
people who were the first to have a relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with the One GOD, but they have not been willing to travel
through the narrow passageway into GOD’s presence.  Because of this, they may
not be a part of the ultimate Reign of GOD. Being able to claim an association
with GOD through history is not enough to assure a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>place in the establishment of the divine Reign.  In fact,
some of the former non-believers (the last) will enter into GOD’s Reign instead
of, or at least before, those who were called first and refused to answer GOD’s
call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, the readings are sources of hope for me.  I have
been able to weather very trying times by holding onto the hope given in the
eighth chapter of Paul’s Letter to the Romans.  A while ago, I was reminded of
the fact that GOD can make GOoD things come out of the most seemingly
disastrous happenings.  At an early morning Bible Study, we were discussing the
fires that have consumed many acres in California over the last few years (including
the town of Paradise and Greenville) or the fire on Maui in 2023 or wars in
Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and similarly we could have discussed
hurricanes, or the earthquakes, or the floods, or the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>pandemic, or any tragedy that affects (or has affected)
people.  Some of the members of the group were saying that they appreciated
hearing about the GOoD things that were reported during the “acts of nature” or
acts of GOD or human-caused disasters.  We shared the accounts of how people
were thinking of others and assisting others in evacuations, or helping them
after the fact.  Others commented how people had to really contemplate what
they valued most in their lives as they were forced to start new lives when
their old lives were destroyed. Even some of the responses of those who had
lost everything were uplifting as they shared how they felt blessed to “escape”
with their lives.  Similarly, those who were staying at home during the
pandemic found more time to pray and reflect upon GOD’s Word.  We continued to
discuss how the disasters had made all of us reflect on the values we have in
our lives.  It seemed that the most depressing stories came from individuals
who saw no hope or future beyond their present, tragic circumstances.  They
were so focused on the immediate that they could not see the “bigger picture”
in which GOD promises an eternal home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being able to hold onto the hope that GOD will make all
things work together for the GOoD of those who trust in GOD is what brings a
sense of purpose to life (and even to death).  GOD wants us to share in the
blessings of the “Firstborn of many sisters and brothers.”  Jesus has preceded
us into the eternal home of His Abba.  He has journeyed through the most narrow
of ways, even to the point of death, dying the most excruciatingly painful
death on the cross.  Jesus’ resurrection is a sign of the glorious life that
awaits all who follow their Brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we face the tragedies that are part of our journeying on
earth, we are given the hope that GOD is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ultimately in control, that Jesus has won the final battle,
and that we are promised a share in the glory of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reign of GOD.  We need to join the psalmist, not just in our
heavenly home, but even now as we travel along the way, and say, “GOD has been
GOoD to me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What do St. Paul’s
words mean to me:  “All things work for the GOoD of those who are called by
GOD”? Do I see that that applies to me?  In retrospect, can I see how even the
most difficult times in my life worked for the GOoD for myself and others? What
can I do to help others who are going through rough times and need to be
reassured that “all things work for the GOoD of those who are called by GOD”?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all GOoDness.  Even in the most
difficult of situations, You have promised to make GOoD things work together
for us, if we but remain focused on You and Your Son, through the workings of
the Holy Spirit in our lives.  We, however, have sometimes dwelt only on the
bad and failed to trust You fully.  We have sometimes failed to pray and allow
the Holy Spirit to guide our prayer.  For our lack of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>trust in You and Your GOoDness, we seek Your healing and
forgiveness.  As we continue our journey toward the Realm that You have
prepared for us as Your adopted sons and daughters, help us to seek Your will
in all aspects of our lives and to believe that You will make GOoD things
happen for us as we place our hope in You. May we someday join all those who
call upon You and may we give You all the glory and praise that You are due. 
We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and
Lord, Who has preceded us in life and death and into the glorious Reign You
have prepared, for He is one with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 8: 31b-39;        Psalm 109: 21-22, 26-27,
30-31;          Luke 13: 31-35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The unconditional love of GOD takes center stage in the
readings today.  St. Paul continues to assert that nothing can separate us from
the love of GOD as demonstrated in the life and ministry (and death and
resurrection) of Jesus.  The psalmist asks for GOD’s help with the firm
assurance that GOD will help because, by helping, the LORD GOD receives glory and
praise.  In the Gospel, Jesus draws ever closer to Jerusalem, the place where
He will give Himself in complete and loving service for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul uses a couple of analogies to explain how much GOD
loves the world.  First, he uses legal terms to explain GOD’s love.  He
mentions that GOD is not going to be our prosecutor, nor even an unmerciful
judge. GOD has already paid the cost of our being declared “non-guilty” through
the death and resurrection of Jesus.  If GOD has gone to such an extent to earn
our freedom, nothing can be said to convict us and to sentence us to the
eternal death penalty that we deserve.  In a second comparison, Paul describes
GOD’s love as more powerful than the celestial happenings of stars and planets
that many of Paul’s listeners had formerly (and maybe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>still) believed to be the forces with which to be reckoned. 
It was commonly assumed that the heavenly bodies (stars, planets, the moon, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the sun) controlled great power over people and history. 
Paul asserts that GOD’s love is even more powerful than the astronomical
happenings.  Nothing can separate us from the love of GOD (with one exception –
our sinfulness, and even then GOD will still love us, but we hinder GOD’s love
from taking root in us until we seek reconciliation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is the prayer of one who is encountering rough
times.  The author prays that GOD will assist him in his difficulty, not simply
as a sign of mercy, but for the purpose of the person’s being able to give
glory to GOD for all the mighty things GOD does for those who are loved by GOD
and love GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus draws ever closer to Jerusalem.  Some
of the Pharisees, who are believers in Jesus, report to him that King Herod
wants to kill Him.  Jesus defiantly tells them to set Herod straight and shows
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He is aware that He must go to Jerusalem to meet His death. 
Yet, on the third day (not from the present time, but after His death), Jesus
will rise. Jesus shows His unconditional love for Jerusalem (and the people who
are represented by the city).  He uses an analogy of a hen gathering the chicks
under her wings to protect them.  Just as the mother hen will do anything</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for the sake of the chicks, so Jesus loves the people of
Jerusalem (and all people) even though some of them are plotting against Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am once again overwhelmed by
the love of GOD.  GOD did not have to create the world and humans.  GOD willed
to love humanity enough to give life.  Yet, GOD’s love did not stop there. GOD
gave human beings the ability to freely love.  That gift is truly a share in
the very image of GOD, for GOD freely chooses to love.  With the ability to
freely choose to love comes also the ability to refuse to love, and that is
sin.  GOD could have left mortals in the depths that their failures to love
cast them.  GOD’s love, however, was more powerful than the results of sin. 
GOD wanted to give sinful humanity yet a second (and third, and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fourth. . .) chance.  Thus, GOD sent the Only-begotten Son
to give the ultimate sign of divine love.  In His incarnation and life, Jesus
came to demonstrate that GOD’s love is truly unconditional, love with no
strings attached.  Because of the hardness of our hearts and brains, Jesus had
to perform the ultimate sacrifice of love so that we could begin to fathom the
depths, heights, and the power of GOD’s love.  It is only through Jesus’ death
and resurrection that people begin to understand the limitless characteristics
of GOD’s love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have “known” the essential teachings of the Bible since I
was young.  I could quote passages such as John 3:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16 (“GOD so loved the world. . .”) and Romans 8: 31-39
(today’s First Reading) when I was in grammar school. I could use apologetics
to present the teachings of church.  Yet, having “head knowledge” was not
enough.  It is only when I began to have “heart knowledge” that I was blown
away by the Truth of GOD’s love.  Nothing can separate us from the love of
GOD.  GOD has loved us, still loves us, and will always love us no matter what.
GOD, however, will never take away our ability to accept or reject the
unconditional, divine love.  GOD will do everything to have us experience that
love, but GOD will not force us to love.  And just as a loving parent still
loves a wayward child, GOD will never stop loving us, even if we choose to
eternally reject that gift of love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we contemplate the immensity and awesomeness of GOD’s
love, let us realize that the most loving response we can have to GOD’s love is
to lift up a prayer of praise and thanks to GOD for that love.  Or, to use the
words of the psalmist today, “I will speak my thanks earnestly to the LORD, and
in the midst of the throng I will praise GOD, for the LORD stood at the right
hand of the poor, to save them from those who would condemn their souls.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my reaction
when I hear that “nothing will separate us from the love of GOD”?  How does the
statement affect my daily life? What have I allowed to be hindrances to the
flow of GOD’s love in my life? What can I do to help others experience the
unconditional love that GOD has for them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all love.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have been clothed with Your countless gifts of love:  earthly
life, forgiveness, Your presence, and eternal life with You.  We have sometimes
taken Your love for granted or failed to reflect on how much You truly love
us.  We have, at times, refused to accept Your love.  We seek the pardon and
forgiveness that Your Son has gained for us through His death and resurrection. 
Through the gifts of Your Holy Spirit, continue to enlighten us so that we can
more fully grasp the limitless extent of Your love.  We make this prayer in the
name of Your Son, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Lord, Who is Love Incarnate and
Who is one with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Alphonsus Rodriguez:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-alphonsus-rodriguez</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 9: 1-5;         Psalm 147: 12-13, 14-15,
19-20;        Luke 14: 1-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings present the misunderstanding of some Jews who
have failed to perceive GOD’s plan for salvation as revealed in and through
Jesus.  St. Paul finds it hard to believe that more Jews had not embraced
Christianity after being familiar with all the Hebrew scriptures that pointed
to Jesus as the Christ.  The psalmist remarks how blessed the Jewish people are
to have such a GOD Who continually interacted with them.  In the Gospel, Jesus
once again expresses His displeasure with some of the Jewish officials who were
more concerned about the letter of the Law than about its spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the part of his letter to the Romans read today, St. Paul
shares his sadness at the fact that many Jews have not accepted Jesus as the
Messiah (the Christ, the Anointed One).  Paul wonders how it is possible that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who had been chosen to be GOD’s people from early in
their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>history could not accept Jesus as the fulfillment of all
their prophets.  I am sure he also remembers that he did not originally accept
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reiterates the point of the Chosen People have
been blessed by GOD in ways of which other nations only dreamed.  GOD has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>revealed the plan of salvation to the descendants of Israel.
In the Gospel, Jesus chides the hypocrisy of the some of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jewish leaders who take care of their own household and
their animals on the Sabbath, but they are not willing to allow others to be
healed by the hand of GOD through the instrumentality of others. Jesus shows
His compassion for a man suffering from dropsy (edema), thus demonstrating
GOD’s love for people, especially the sick and outcasts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflected on the readings today, it is easy to put down
the lack of faith of the Jews who did not accept Jesus as the Messiah.  I
wonder why they could not see the obvious references from the Hebrew scriptures
that point to Jesus.  It is then that I realize that at times I have not always
been open to the “obvious” revelation of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, in and through Jesus.  Oh, I can point to passages from
the Old Testament and give the textbook explanation of how they are linked to
Jesus and His life and ministry, His death and resurrection.  I, however,
sometimes miss the Truth – Jesus – in my life.  Jesus is present in my life in
ways of which I sometime am not aware.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recall once experiencing the Gospel in a way that was
similar to being hit on the head with a brick.  A beggar had come to a church
to receive help from the church pastor and the associate pastor.  The two
members of the clergy brushed off the needy person.  They had seen a lot of
panhandlers pass by who only wanted money to support their “habits,” and not
virtuous habits.  The poor individual sat on the front steps of the church. 
When a parishioner came by to make a visit to the Lord Jesus in the church –
the house of GOD, the parishioner saw the unfortunate person and the
parishioner took the stranger to his own home where he and his wife fed the
beggar with the meager provisions that the family had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people would defend the action of the clergy who did
not want to be taken advantage of by another person who might be using a “false
need” to get money for another drink or to spend it gambling (since this took
place in Tahoe near the Nevada stateline) or some other addiction.  They would
also say that the parishioner who </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>took in the stranger was taking a chance inviting the beggar
into his home.  Yet, from a Christian perspective, the parishioner was living
out the Gospel with the firm belief that in treating the stranger with
compassion, he was ministering to Christ (cf. Matthew 25: 31-46).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We (who are so caught up in the politically correct and
legally right thing to do) can miss opportunities to experience GOD’s
self-revelation through the experiences of life.  Had the parishioner done what
the law and society said was the “safe” thing to do, he would not have invited
the needy person into his home.  Yet, in doing the “Gospel” thing, the man and
his wife became aware of the presence of Jesus in their midst in the person of
an individual who needed help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is constantly making the divine presence known in our
daily experiences.  Sometimes we fail to see the Truth because we are so caught
up in the rules and regulations, the precautions and warnings with which we
have been indoctrinated.  I am not advocating inviting every beggar into our
home at all times.  Yet, when we are motivated by the Spirit to reach out and
share what we have, we might experience GOD in ways we least expect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I been
aware of the presence of the Lord Jesus in a needy person I encountered?   Have
I failed to minister to the needy person out of fear of what might happen or
what others might say about me or because I might have believed the “needy”
person was seeking to use me to support his/her addictive behavior?  When I
have taken the risk to reach out to someone, was I more aware of presence of
Jesus with me? What can I do today to be more aware of how the Lord Jesus might
be revealing Himself to me, and through me to someone less fortunate?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all Truth.  Through Your
GOoDness You have revealed Your presence throughout all history.  You made
Yourself known to Abraham and his descendants.  At times, they failed to
understand Who You are and what You were trying to have them experience.  In
the fullness of time You sent Your Son as the perfect revelation of Your Being,
because He is one with You in Being.  Even though His coming had been foretold,
many did not accept Him.  You continue to reveal Yourself to us.  Like the
Chosen People before us, we sometimes have not been open to Your presence.  We
come before You, contrite and repentant.  We ask that You continue to send Your
Holy Spirit with gifts of wisdom and understand so that we can experience You
in our daily living.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Master- Teacher and Lord, Who is present in the least of His sisters and
brothers, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
GOD for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solemnity of All Saints: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/solemnity-of-all-saints</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Revelation 7: 2-4, 9-14;       Psalm 24: 1-2,
3-4, 5-6;      1 John 3: 1-3;        Matthew 5: 1-12a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is All Saints’ (All Hallows’) Day.  This solemnity
replaces Wednesday of the Thirtieth Week in Ordinary Time.  The First Reading
(from the Book of Revelation) gives us a glimpse of heaven where a great crowd
of people are gathered around the Lamb (Jesus). It is a gathering of people
from every land and nation.  The throngs are there to give glory to GOD forever
since they have lived lives</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that gave witness to GOD.  The psalm describes those who are
privileged to ascend the mountain of the LORD and come into GOD’s presence. 
St. John, in his First Letter, remarks that we can’t fully comprehend the
greatness of being in heaven.  In the Gospel account of the Beatitudes, Jesus
describes how blessed (joyful) will be those who live lives that reflect their
relationship with GOD and others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the readings describe the glory that awaits those who
are part of the heavenly Reign of GOD.  A key element in the readings that
leads to my reflection is the fact that heaven is the place where</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people from all countries and backgrounds will be able to
celebrate the glory of GOD.  This will be especially true for those who have
been witnesses (Greek: μαρτυροι - martyroi) to Jesus and His Gospel. The psalm
(about those who are allowed to ascend GOD’s mountain because of their clean
hearts) can easily be seen as an analogy for entering the presence of GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in heaven after a life that has manifested one’s
relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  John’s reminder that heaven is far beyond even our
greatest imaginations is an uplifting and exciting passage.  The joy and
happiness of heaven can begin here on earth if we follow the guidelines given
in the Beatitudes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to share with you a little of my understanding
of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what the Catholic Church calls the Communion of Saints.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>῞Αγιοι- Hagioi in Greek) means “holy ones.”  It is a term
Paul uses for members of the faith community. It includes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not only those here on earth, but also those who have
crossed from this earthly existence to the existence beyond earthly death.  All
who are united with Christ are members of the communion of saints.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a bond (interrelationship) between all those who
are in the communion of saints.  According to Church teachings, the Communion
of Saints is divided into three parts: 1) the Church Militant; 2) the Church
Suffering; and 3) the Church Triumphant, those who are rejoicing with the Lord
Jesus in heaven.  The Church Militant are those of us still fighting the
spiritual battle here on earth. We are still in the struggle against the forces
of evil.  We are still facing opposition as we make our journey to the house of
our GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Church Suffering are those who have passed from this
life. They are not yet completely with GOD.  As mentioned in Book of Maccabees
(the Jewish writings of the second century before the birth of Jesus), the
Jewish people (especially those who would become Pharisees) started to believe
in the resurrection of the dead and life after death.  In that book, we hear
the words, “it is a GOoD and holy thing to pray for the dead.”  Many Jews of
that era and the ages after</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it believed that there was a bond between those on earth and
those who had died. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Catholic Church calls this transitional state [in which
people are (after death and before fully realizing the glory of heaven)]
“purgatory.” I use the word “purgation” to refer not to a place but to a stage
of transition.  Those who have lived a life that was not eternally damning, yet
still missed being right on target (ad Deum - towards GOD), may not “feel”
comfortable with the awesomeness of GOD.  It is the love that GOD has
demonstrated in the death of Jesus that enables us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to make the transition from earthly existence to heavenly
existence.  Yet the awareness of that love may not be realized fully by those
who are in transition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let me use an analogy.  If one were invited to the White
House to dine with the president (whoever he or she might be) at the
president’s request, it would be a momentous occasion.  If, on the way to 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, one had a flat tire and had to fix it (presume that there
was no AAA truck around to help), one would probably get a little dirty.  As
one approached the White House, one would probably want to get cleaned up a bit
before going to meet the president.  Yet, the president, being gracious and
anxious to have one as a guest and share in the specialness of the White House,
comes out to meet the guest, not caring that the guest has dirty hands because
of having to change the flat tire.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s graciousness is even more overpowering. GOD wants us
to share fully in the glory of heaven.  Yet as we begin to fully understand the
magnificence of GOD, we would want to get everything in order.  We would want
to be cleansed with the water of love and the blood of the Lamb (as mentioned
in the Book of Revelation).  The love that cleanses us ultimately comes from
GOD (since GOD is love).  Yet, the loving prayers and thoughtful petitions of
other members of the Communion of Saints can make it easier for us to accept
GOD’s love.  Thus, we on earth (the Church Militant) can be a part of enabling
those who have died to feel and experience the love that emanates from GOD.  So
also, those who are fully with GOD (the Church Triumphant) can be a part of
extending the cleansing love of GOD to those who are in the stage of purgation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, those who are sharing at the glorious banquet of the
Lord Jesus in heaven can be sources of inspiration to us who are still fighting
the GOoD fight here on earth.  They can continue to be examples of what it
means to struggle against the forces of evil.  We are united with them and they
with us, since we are all part of the Communion of Holy Ones (Saints). We on
earth can invoke the saints in heaven to pray for us, just as we often ask some
people (who are on earth and who exhibit a sense of holiness) to pray for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, we must remember that holiness comes from GOD.  It is
GOD’s gift to us.  Our actions on earth are just signs of our acceptance of
GOD’s gift of holiness.  The more we live GOoD and GODly lives, the more we
demonstrate our relationship with the GOD Who is the font of holiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is exciting to think that we are part of the Holy Ones of
GOD.  That is our future destiny, yes.  Yet, that is who we are called to be
and live right here and now.  We are called to be holy because our GOD is
holy.  We are saints right now, even though we have not realized, nor will we
realize, the fullness of what that holiness is all about until we are one with
the Lord Jesus and all of GOD’s Holy Ones for ever and ever in the heavenly
Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What does the
“Communion of Saints” mean to me? How do I feel when I realize I am called to
be a saint? How do I live out my sainthood – holiness – right now? Can people
experience the holiness of GOD when I interact with them? Do I draw them into
the holiness of GOD by my relating to them in a GOoD, holy, and GODly way?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of all holiness. Through
Your GOoDness, You invite us to participate in Your holy life. You have called
us to be saints. This is what You want us to be, not only in the future, but
also right now. As we experience our relationship with You through Your Son,
Jesus, and in the unity of the Holy Spirit, we realize we are also united with
other members of Your faithful, both those here journeying along our ways on
earth and those who have passed from this life to the next. May we make
ourselves even more aware of the bond that exists with all who call upon You as
their GOD. We thank You for giving us GOoD examples of how to live out our
relationship with You by the saints who have come before us. We know of many
saints (holy ones), some still living here with us on earth and some who have
“transitioned” to life with You in Your heavenly Reign, and who have reflected
Your love to us. We give You praise and glory for allowing us to be part of all
Your saints. We make this prayer through Jesus, Your Son, Who has called us to
be one with Him in Your eternal and heavenly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>home. It is there that we will be united with Jesus Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 3: 1-9  or  Isaiah 25: 6-9;                             
Psalm 23: 1-3a, 3b-4, 5, 6; Roman 5: 5-11  or  Romans 6: 3-4,
8-9;                    John 6: 37-40</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note:    The readings for today’s celebration of All Souls
are not reserved to the list above but can be taken from any of the readings
for the Masses for the Dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned in the reading from the Book of Wisdom, those
who have died are truly in the hands of GOD.  The readings remind us that GOD
wants the best for us and will provide more than we can ever imagine. Isaiah
speaks of a time when every tear will be wiped away.  The familiar Psalm 23
proclaims GOD’s protection and providence.  St. Paul tells the faith-full
people of Rome that GOD has always loved us (even when we sin) and that through
baptism we share in both the death and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.  In
the Gospel, Jesus promises to raise up</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all those who believe in Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from Wisdom was written about a century before
the coming of Jesus, during a time when some of the Jewish people were developing
the concepts of life after death.  It is part of the Catholic listing of books
of Old Testament, but Wisdom is not in all Protestant Old</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Testament.  It speaks about the hope for those who have died
and their being in the hands of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah (http://usccb.org/bible/isaiah/25:6) bolsters the
faith of the Chosen People who are struggling from oppression and war.  Isaiah
wants to reassure them that GOD will eventually provide for them in such a way
that there will be no more mourning or sorrow.  GOD will come to the people and
save them from their persecutors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The often quoted Psalm 23 brings comfort not only to the
people at the time of psalmist, but also for the people of the millennia since
then.  GOD is pictured as a loving Shepherd who leads the wayward flock to
safety.  GOD will win a victory for the Chosen People and provide a victory
feast that surpasses any before it.  The cup of joy and happiness will be
overflowing. Only the best will be given to those who have followed the lead of
the Divine Shepherd.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the fifth chapter of his Letter to the Romans  Roman 5:
5-11, St. Paul reminds his readers (including us), that if GOD has gone so far
as to send Jesus down to earth, to live as a human, to teach, suffer, and die
for us, while we are still sinners (enemies of GOD), then GOD is showing how
much we are loved and how much GOD wants us to be in heaven with the Lord
Jesus. This message is repeated in the Gospel of John 6: 37-40.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sixth chapter of St.  Paul’s Letter to the Romans has
comforting words to those who are going through rough times.  Paul emphasizes
very strongly that if we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>truly “plunged” (baptized) into Christ, we share in His
sufferings and death.  Death is part of our existence as mortals.  The GOoD
News is that, if we have been willing to share in Jesus’ suffering and death,
then we will also share in His resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus proclaims that He has come to do the
will of His Abba-Father. Part of the will of GOD includes His raising up all
who believe in Him and share in His life (death, and resurrection).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With all this in mind, we turn to today’s celebration – All
Souls (All the Faithful Departed).  Today we show our union with those who have
died and are making the transition to the fullness of GOD’s presence. Our prayers
and love (both of which are gifts originating in GOD) are </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>part of what unites us with our loved ones on the final
steps of their journey to the home of our Lord Jesus and His Abba- Father. 
Also it is important for us to realize that after death, the time-space
constraints we experience on earth are gone. What seems like a thousand years
to us on earth is only a brief “moment” for those who are no longer bound by
time-space barriers but are beginning to live eternally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I know there have been times when I have sensed the presence
of my departed mother and father.  It is not a negative feeling at all, but
rather a warm, positive feeling.  I know that they are with the Lord Jesus and
also near me.  We are still united in the communion of saints – GOD’s holy ones
on both sides of the event we call death.  And the bond of our union is love –
the love of GOD – love that is GOD in the fullness of divinity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Death, then, is a transition from earthly life to eternal
life.  Part of the that transition is a realization of what our life has been,
and recognition of the times when we have not always matched up to the plan of
GOD.  In that transition known as death, GOD’s love purifies (purges) us so
that we can enjoy the fullness of the eternal life that Jesus has gained for us
through His death and resurrection.  Death can be scary, particularly as we
realize our own imperfections. Yet, the belief</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we have as imperfect (but striving to be faithful) disciples
of the Lord Jesus, is that Jesus’ obedience to the will of His Abba has raised
us up and opened to us the fullness of eternal life.  For those who have
refused to acknowledge the life that Jesus offered to them, death is not a
joyful transition to eternal life, but a sorrowful movement to eternal
separation from the GOD Whom they have chosen not to accept or with Whom they
have wanted no relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned before, for those who are united in the love of
GOD, there is a connection between those still on earth and those who are
“transitioning” or who have “transitioned” to the eternal life in heaven.  The
bond that unites the faithful on both sides of the event known as death is the
Love that/Whom we know as GOD.  Since Jesus, the GOD-man, has lived on both
sides of death and has gone through the death-experience, He is able to unite
people on both sides of death.  His resurrection is the way through which He
intends us all to travel so that we can know, not just mentally, but
experientially, the risen life that He shares with His Abba.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think one of the things that is comforting as I reflect on
the readings and this celebration of our union with those who had gone before
us in the peace of the Risen Lord is the last words of today’s psalm.  Changing
the words slightly to reflect our common bonds, we can pray the words, “Only
GOoDness and kindness follow us all the days of our lives; and we shall dwell
in the house of the LORD for years to come.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of
those who have preceded me in making the transition from earthly life to
eternal life, what thoughts and feelings come to me? Do I sense that there
exist a bond of love between us, made possible by the One Who is Love? Am I
strengthened by the hope of the eternal life that is offered me through the
death and resurrection of Jesus? How can I reassure others of what awaits those
who are in union with the Lord Jesus and His Abba?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD and giver of life, both earthly
and heavenly.  Through Your GOoDness, You have loved us into earthly existence
and into eternity.  You desire that nothing, even sin and death, should come
between You and us, if we seek to be one with You.  You want us to be united
with all those who claim You as GOD, both those still struggling with burdens
in this life, and those who have made the transition to the eternal life with
You in heaven.  May we always be reminded of those who have lovingly touched
our lives while we and they were here on earth.  May one day we be united with
them as we celebrate with our Risen Lord, Your Son, Jesus.  It is He Who has
promised us eternal rest in Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>house.  And it is in Jesus’ name we lift this prayer of
praise and unity, for He has died, but is risen, and is living and reigning
with You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 11: 29-36;       Psalm 69: 30-31, 33-34,
36;         Luke 14: 12-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD’s ways are so much different from human ways.  St. Paul
speaks of the incomprehensible thoughts of GOD in that GOD allows human freedom
of choice, knowing that people will choose sinful ways, but this allows GOD to
extend mercy to the wayward.  The psalmist cries out to GOD, trusting that GOD
will hear the prayer and respond lovingly.  In the Gospel, Jesus challenges His
dinner host by asking him to go against the human trait of only inviting those
who can repay in kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As St. Paul ponders the plan of GOD, he is once again
overwhelmed by the divine plan.  GOD’s thoughts are so beyond human thoughts
that they are not able to be fully understood by the limited human mind.  GOD
grants freedom of choice to humans.  Yet, even after all of GOD’s mighty deeds
toward the original Chosen People (the Jews), many of them used their human
freedom to choose paths that were a-theos (against or away from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the concept of the GOD Whom Jesus preached).  Paul realizes
that GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>foreknowledge of this experience has worked for the GOoD of
not only the Hebrew people, but even the pagan people who had been a-theos. 
The disobedience (sinfulness) of both the Jews and the Gentiles enabled GOD to
show mercy and forgiveness and to draw the wayward back to GOD (ad-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Deum).  In the whole process, GOD is to be given glory and
praise for the divine plan of salvation being worked out for the GOoD of all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a prayer of petition to GOD from one who is
having a rough time (affliction and pain).  It is also a prayer of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>trust in GOD, knowing that the LORD hears the earnest
requests of those who are in need.  In the humble supplication to GOD, one
admits the need for GOD and acknowledges the LORD GOD as the One Who saves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus dines with a Pharisee in today’s Gospel, He
addresses the human action of those who do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>positive acts merely for the purpose of having others treat
them in the same way.  Jesus lifts up the bar above the normal “Do unto others
as you would want them to do to you.”  Jesus says that if the only motive for
caring for others is so that others will respond in kind, one is not living up
to the call of being His disciple.  If one really cared for others, one would
be like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD who responds to those who have no way of repaying GOD
for the divine mercy and kindness shown to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today make me look at my modus operandi (way of
operating or m.o.).  It is so easy to do things in the typically human, selfish
manner – acting in ways that benefit me at the cost of others.  We have free
choice and often uses the freedom we have to do acts that will be for our
immediate (or in the near future) pleasure.  That is so different from the way
GOD acts.  GOD is always aware of the ultimate GOoD – eternal life with all
those who are in relationship with the Trinity.  GOD has gone to the greatest
limits to do what is for the GOoD of others, not counting the divine cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD even uses human sinfulness to bring about GOoD.  Because
of sin, Jesus entered history, was born a human, lived, taught, suffered, died,
and rose.  This became a saving event not just for the Chosen People of old, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but for all people.  GOD’s love is not limited to, but
extends beyond, the Chosen People, reaching out to all who are willing to
accept the divine gifts.  This is so beyond human comprehension and
understanding.  Once in a while, we see demonstrations of unconditional,
selfless love on the parts of some human beings at some times in their lives. 
GOD, however, has been, is, and always will be loving towards all of
humankind.  It was not enough for GOD to give mortals life.  It was not enough
to allow them to have free will and choose whether or not they would accept
GOD’s graces.  GOD took the steps to bring about forgiveness and eternal
salvation in the incarnation, life, suffering, death, and resurrection of
Jesus.  No wonder Paul calls Jesus a stumbling block to the Jews and folly to
the Gentiles.  The modus operandi Dei – GOD’s way of operating – is total
beyond human experience and understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is even more amazing to me, is how personal this divine
modus operandi is.  GOD did not perform saving acts just for humanity as a
whole, but for each and every individual personally, including you and me.  My
personal response has to be to try to imitate the divine modus operandi and
love and care for others as GOD has loved and cared for me.  I must be willing
to do GOoD to all people, not just those who can and will be nice back to me. 
I must reach out especially to those who cannot or will not reciprocate the
kindness.  It is then that I will be able to raise my voice with the psalmist
today and say, “I will praise the name of GOD in song,  and I will glorify the
LORD with thanksgiving.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my usual
modus operandi – way of operating?  Are my own desires and pleasures the
driving force in my life?  Do I seek to do things according to the modus operandi
Dei – GOD’s way of operating?  How can I more fully model the modus operandi
Dei?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of unconditional love.  Through
Your GOoDness we are touched by Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>modus operandi.  We have been given a taste of Your
unconditional love and been asked to share it with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>others.  Yet, in our humanness, we have fallen prey to the
selfish pursuits and pleasures that are not reflective of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your being.  For our indiscretions and sins, we ask for Your
forgiveness and pardon.  Through the outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, helps us
to be ever aware of how Your Son, Jesus, manifested the divine modus operandi,
and assist us in our imitation of His selfless love for others.  We lift this
prayer of praise and thanks to You together with Your Son, Jesus, our
Master-Teacher and Savior, Who has died, is risen, and is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 12: 5-16b;        Psalm 131: 1bcde, 2,
3;           Luke 14: 15-24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The community of the faithful, the Body of Christ, is
recognized by their acceptance of GOD’s invitation to be part of the Body, and
by their service of others in the Body of Christ.  In his letter to the Romans,
Saint Paul describes the Christian community as the Body of Christ that works
together for the GOoD of the whole.  Being faithful to GOD should lead to
humility, especially with regards to others, according to the psalmist today. 
In the Gospel, Jesus shares a parable of a festive banquet to which those who
were first invited refuse to come.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>host of the banquet will not be disappointed by the
rejection of those who do not accept the invitation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What St. Paul has developed in his first letter to the
Corinthians (1 Corinthians 12), he reiterates here:  the Church is the Body of
Christ, made up of different members, each performing different tasks.  People
are gifted with different abilities, not only for their own benefit, but also
for the GOoD of all the community.  One</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way that each member of the community can contribute to the
GOoD of the rest is by being of service, acting with humility and compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is the prayer of one who realizes that GOD has
blessed the individual and the only fitting response is honest acknowledgment
of GOD’s greatness and the humble admission that the ones who are proud and
haughty are not relying on the LORD but only themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus shares a parable which explains how
some of the Chosen People have refused to accept GOD’s blessings.  It also
describes GOD’s love and care for all people.  GOD’s plan for extending mercy
and kindness to people will not be thwarted by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>some people’s rejection of GOD’s gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reflecting on the readings today, I am challenged to look at
my position within the community of faith.  It is tempting to believe that GOD
has gifted me with whatever gifts I have because of something I have done.  I
must overcome this temptation and realize that the blessing that I have
received are not the rewards of my efforts nor are they reserved only for my
benefit, but the gifts (charisms) are to be used for the GOoD of the whole
community and in service of others.  It is important for us to reflect on what
gifts GOD has given</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>each of us and to see how we can use those gifts for the
benefit of the rest of the Body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I believe I have the gifts of teaching and listening.  I am
called to communicate the Truth to others. Obviously, the occupation of a
teacher is not the highest paying job.  I have also experienced educators who
are more concerned in demonstrating their vast knowledge and ability to
understand their subject matter, than they are in their students as individuals
or their students’ grasp of knowledge.  I see my role as an educator (both at
school and at church) is to be of service in the process of people gaining
wisdom and understanding.  I also see my role in the school where I used to
work, and in the church where I participate as part of my ministry of service,
as my vocation from the Lord Jesus.  Jesus has called me to be where I have
been in the school, and to do what I have done and am doing and at church, all
for the sake of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my ability to listen to others, I am called to be there
for them as they share their thoughts and struggles. Again, when I do this, I
am not doing it for my financial gain, but to be of service to others.  It is
interesting how </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people at work and in my faith community, or people I meet,
seem comfortable sharing their concerns and troubles with me.  My response of
listening to them is also part of my calling from the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In contrast to my gifts, there are individuals of whose help
I am in need, in order to help me as I continue my journey of faith.  There are
those who are clear thinkers and great organizers.  Other people are the real
people behind the scene who get things done without anyone knowing who they are
or how they do it.  They perform their ministry in a quiet, humble way, while
myself and so many others are the beneficiaries of their quietly living out
their gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All are invited to the heavenly banquet feast of GOD.  Some,
sadly, want nothing to do with GOD’s plans. They make excuses that seem
important, but they are just trying to act politically correct to cover their
refusal to go along with GOD’s plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has a desire to have a community of loving people,
caring and serving each other, and enjoying each other’s companion in the
divine presence.  This divine desire will not be ruined by those who refuse to
participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is important is that each of us respond to GOD’s call,
using the gifts that GOD has given us for the benefit of the whole community. 
Nothing should be beyond our concern.  No job is too small or too big for us if
we are called to do so for the GOoD of others.  We must humbly draw closer to
GOD and enjoy being in GOD’s presence just as a young child is pleased</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sitting on its mother’s lap, as the psalm mentions:  “Nay
rather, I have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child.  Like a weaned
child on its mother’s lap, so is my soul within me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I contemplate
my talents and abilities, what do I see as the gifts that GOD has given me? How
can I use those gifts for the GOoD of the community and in service of others? 
How can I help others to make proper use of their GOD-given gifts to help build
up and edify the Body of Christ?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, Giver of all GOoD gifts.  Through
Your GOoDness You have graced Your people with all the talents and abilities
necessary to grow together as a loving community since all of us are called to
share in Your eternal banquet feast.  You have blessed each of us with special
abilities, not for our own selfish gains, but to be of benefit to others.  At
times we have misused the talents and gifts You have given us, seeking our own
pleasure, gain, or fame.  For our failure to use what You have given us
according to Your “Big Picture,” we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue
to pour out the gifts that flow from Your Holy Spirit. Enable us to appreciate
not only our own abilities, but also those of others who strive to edify and
build up the Body of Your Son, the community of the faithful.  We lift up this
prayer of praise and glory to You together with Your Son, Jesus, Who is our Brother
and Master-Teacher and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 13: 8-10;        Psalm 112: 1b-2, 4-5,
9;          Luke 14: 25-33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love is the central to our readings today and central to our
lives as disciples of the Lord Jesus.  Saint Paul re- affirms that the whole
law and all the commandments can be summed up in the saying, “You shall love
your neighbor as yourself.”  The psalmist describes people who are blessed as
those who show concern for others.  In the Gospel, Jesus commands His disciples
to love GOD above all others, including members of their own family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In writing to the Romans, St. Paul maintains the supremacy
of love. Having earlier in his letter to the Romans refuted the law with all of
its commandments, Paul today asserts that all of the commandments (including
those found in the Ten Big Ones) can be summarized in loving others as one
loves oneself.  If one truly loves those around, then one has fulfilled all the
precepts of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>According to the psalmist, great blessings are in store for
those who keep the commandments of the LORD.  The first line of today’s Responsorial
is the key line.  It is not simply because one is obedient to the commandments
that one is rewarded.  It is in having the right relationship with GOD (“fear</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the LORD”) that ensures that one is blessed.  “Fear of
the LORD” does not mean we are afraid to draw closer to GOD, but that we
acknowledge the “awesomeness of GOD” and want to draw closes to the
“terrific/terrifying” LORD of all.  As people realizes how blessed they are and
how “awe-filled” GOD is, they will continue to treat others well, thus
following the precepts of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus addresses the multitude who have
gathered around Him wanting to be His disciples.  Jesus speaks words which at
first seem contradictory to the other readings today.  He tells His would-be
disciples that they must “hate” their mothers and fathers, wives and children,
sisters and brothers.  This includes being willing to carry one’s cross and
follow Jesus.  In saying this, Jesus challenges His listeners to make a
relationship with Him and His Abba-Father the number one priority in their
lives.  GOD has to be the center (hub) of our lives and everything else will be
the spokes going out from the hub.  Nothing, including family ties, can come
before a relationship with the Lord Jesus and the Abba and Holy Spirit.  It
means that one must be a “disciplined” disciple, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>calculating in living out a call to follow Jesus.  If one’s
emotional ties get in the way of making a commitment to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Lord Jesus, then the ties must be broken.  But if one
focuses on the love of GOD, one will be a better and more loving son/daughter,
mother/father, sibling to one’s blood relatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that I am called to
love.  Love is not just the warm “fuzzy” feeling of having everything just
right.  Love is ultimately a decision of the will.  First and foremost, it is
the determination to make GOD number one.  Once I am totally committed to the
Master-Teacher (that is I have true “fear” or appreciation of Who GOD is), then
I will make choices that show where my priorities are.  I will be able to
commend all my efforts in bringing about the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus to all
with whom I come in contact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Loving GOD above all else provides the energy and strength
and freedom to love others, especially when </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>loving others is difficult.  It will mean making the tough
decisions and planning ahead, even when it is uncomfortable to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Almost two decades ago, my family and I have had to make a
difficult decision based on love.  It is because of the love we had for my
father that we had to move him from his mountain home to a facility where he
could receive the proper care for his worsening mental and physical
conditions.  For the few years before we moved</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>him, he had loving ladies take care of him in his house.  It
started with coming in four hours a day, five days a week.  Because of his
deteriorating mental and physical conditions, more caring and dedicated ladies
were added so that during the last few months he was in his home, he had
24-hour a day attention.  Yet the five women who ministered to him were not
able to handle some of the increasingly more physical and mental needs that
developed due to his decreasing abilities (or increasing disabilities).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Making the choice became even more difficult for my brother
and myself especially as we realized that he would most probably never see his
beloved home again.  The most stress-producing times came when Dad would
question why we were moving him.  To compound the pressure, he would tell us
that we did not understand</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what he was going through and that we really did not love
him if we were moving him out of his home (even though years ago he had
promised to go along with us when he could no longer be cared for in his own
home).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What motivated us and kept us going during the preparation,
the move, and the subsequent transition to the caring facility was the fact
that we had planned for it, done a tremendous amount of research, and made
decision based on what would be the most loving and caring plan for Dad.  We
spent a lot of time in prayer and reflection, discussion, and planning.  It was
probably one of the hardest things we had to do, yet it was done because of our
love for GOD and our love for our Dad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is when we are willing to make the hard decision for the
ultimate GOoD of another that we are true disciples of the Lord Jesus.  The
difficult times with my Dad demonstrated to me what loving GOD and loving
others is all about.  I pray that my sharing of this reflection can be a
reassuring light to you and that will strengthen you when you have to make
tough decision.  If it has been helpful to you, then I will be blessed by GOD,
for I, like the psalmist today, will be able to say that I have been “dawn
through the darkness, a light for the upright” because I am seeking to be
“gracious and merciful and just” out of “fear [awe] of the LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What has been my
primary, motivating force when I have had to make difficult decisions,
especially when the decisions are related to persons who are special in my
life?  Have I avoided making the tough decision?  Have I planned ahead, as much
as possible, so that when I made the decision(s), I was prepared as I could be?
Did I act in love – true compassion and care for others?  Did I seek to be
faithful to the GOD Who loves and Who calls me to love as GOD loves?   Did my
relationship with GOD help me to make the GOoD choice for all those involved?
How can I be more supportive of others as they make the tough, but loving,
decisions in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all love.  Through Your
GOoDness You have demonstrated what true love is:  the willingness to do for
others in spite of the personal cost.  Your Son, Jesus, has called us to be His
disciples and follow in His footsteps, to take up the difficult cross, and to
put Him and You above all others.  In His life, ministry, death, and
resurrection He has given us an example of love that is beyond all human
understanding.  For the times we have failed to live up to the challenge He has
given us to love others, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to
strengthen us by the power of Your Holy Spirit, so that we will make the right
and loving decisions.  We lift up this prayer of praise and glory to You
together with Your Son, Jesus, Who is our Brother and Master-Teacher and Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today speak of the judgment we all face at our
death and/or at the end of time.  St. Paul reminds the Romans that they are not
to judge each other, but they should be conscious of the judgment they all face
when they stand in the presence of GOD.  The psalmist gives hope to those who
trust in GOD, reassuring them that GOoD things await them if they look forward
to the coming of the LORD.  In the Gospel, Jesus relates two parables that
speak of the joy of GOD and the heavenly company as sinners repent and turn to
GOD for forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul must have heard of bickering and criticism by
certain members of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Roman community of faith.  He tells them they have been set
free from slavery to laws and other masters once they claimed the mastery of
Jesus over them. They are to be subject only to the will and desire of the Lord
Jesus.  Knowing that Jesus is the Master, they should not sit in judgment over
their sisters and brothers in the Lord Jesus.  GOD will be the ultimate judge,
and GOD is the One to Whom they should look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm continues the idea of looking to the
LORD.  The psalmist urges people to await the coming of the LORD GOD.  If one
trust in GOD, then there should be nothing to fear, for the LORD is one’s life
refuge, light, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>salvation.  As one anticipates the final coming of the LORD,
one can expect</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoDness and blessedness. The fifteenth chapter of the
Gospel according to Luke</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presents three parables of Jesus, of which we hear the first
two today.  All three parables describe the joy that exists when sinners repent
and turn back to GOD.  It produces celebration for all those connected with the
heavenly Reign.  The first parable is that of the shepherd who leaves the
ninety-nine faithful sheep and goes in search of the wayward one.  The second
parable describes the joy of a woman who searches for, and finds, the one lost
coin of her treasured ten coins.  Jesus concludes these two parables by saying
there is more joy in heaven over one repentant sinner than over those who do
not need to repent since they are walking the ways of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I think about today’s readings, I realize that many
people are worried about their judgment at the end of their lives.  Some see
the time of standing at the gates of heaven or before the throne of GOD as
worse than standing in court before a stern magistrate.  And, in some sense,
all of us should be more concerned about our status before GOD than appearing
in traffic court for a violation of some vehicular law.  For the offense against
GOD through sin is much more grievous than speeding or illegal parking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings also give us a sense of hope and joyful
anticipation, if (and that’s the keyword),  if we are repentant and seek GOD’s
forgiveness.  GOD is more than willing to be tolerant with us, if we admit our
guilt and fall on the mercy of the divine court.  In fact, if we turn toward
the Lord Jesus, GOD will completely remove any negative judgment against us,
because GOD ultimately wants us to experience divine salus – healing,
wholeness, and salvation – and Jesus, the Son of GOD, has already paid the
price to allow us to receive that salus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a sign of our trusting in GOD’s compassionate
understanding and forgiveness of us, we must, in turn, be </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>non-judgmental about the offenses of our fellow journeyers
along the way of faith.  That means we must not be critical of others’
transgressions or failings, pointing the finger of shame at them.  Yes, we must
stand up for what is right and condemn evil deeds and wrongdoings, but we must
have as much compassion for the sinful person as the Lord Jesus has for us.  It
also means that we should rejoice when a wayward sheep returns to the fold,
accepting him/her without being judgmental of the wayward journeying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we are able to be understanding and loving to others
who have failed (as we all have), we will then be able to rejoice in the way
that the Lord Jesus has searched out and brought back the straying members.  It
is then that we will be able to join the heavenly celebration as Jesus mentions
in today’s Gospel when He says, “In just the same way, I tell you, there will
be rejoicing among the angels of GOD over one sinner who repents.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When have I
experienced the loving and compassionate forgiveness from GOD?  What was the
experience like?  Was I able to sense the joy of the Lord Jesus over my being
forgiven?  Am I able to celebrate when someone else seeks forgiveness, or do I
distrust the person’s motives or actions?  How can I help others to experience
the joy that comes from a sinner returning to GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all compassion and mercy. 
Through Your GOoDness You go out in search of the lost and bring them back with
great rejoicing.  You invite us to be a part of Your heavenly celebration, both
as repentant sinners, and “co-rejoicers” in the return of other wayward
individuals.  Yet, being human, we have often been critical of others’ faults,
forgetting about our own transgressions and failings.  For our judgmental attitudes
and unforgiving actions, we seek Your pardon one more time.  May we follow the
example of Your Son, the GOoD Shepherd, Who goes out in search of the errant
sheep.  With the continued guidance and direction of Your Holy Spirit, may we
have the courage to wait for the second coming of Your Son, when all will be
judged compassionately and mercifully, but fairly, by You and Your Son.  To You
be all the glory and praise, especially as the repentant sinners turn to You. 
We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Christ Jesus, the GOoD Shepherd
and Master-Teacher, Who has died, and is risen and Who is living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

Readings:  Romans 15: 14-21;           Psalm 98: 1, 2-3ab, 3cd-4;     Luke 16:
1-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today challenge us to examine the dedication we
have to the mission we have received because we are disciples of the Lord
Jesus.  Saint Paul realizes his mission is to proclaim the GOoD News to the
Gentiles. The psalm reminds us that the mission of all peoples in world who
have seen the glory of the LORD is to praise GOD in song.  In the Gospel, Jesus
urges His disciples to be as ambitious </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in their mission as the dishonest steward is in the parable
that He tells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As St. Paul comes to the close of his letter to the faith
community in Rome, he summarizes his ministry, both what he has done and what
he hopes to do.  He is proud of his living out the call to preach the Gospel to
the non-Jews, especially in areas where the message of Christ has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not yet been preached.  He is looking forward to going
through Rome on his way to preach to the people on the east side of the
Adriatic Sea, and then on to the western end of the civilized Western world at
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time (modern Spain) cf.  Romans 15: 24. Paul is invoking the
missionary spirit of the faithful in Rome, hoping that they will support his
missionary journeys. (Just a note, Paul never seems to have made it to Spain
since he met his death in Rome.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist acclaims the mighty deeds of GOD in making
known the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>divine saving power not only to the Chosen People, but also
to people of all nations.  In response to this action by GOD, the people are
urged to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be a part of GOD’s mission by singing the LORD’s praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus shares the parable of the dishonest
steward who is about to be fired from his job. According to the parable, the
steward does what is allowable by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He reduces the amount of debt to the actual cost, thus not
earning his excessive commission that he received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hope is that the debtors will remember his deeds and be
gracious to him as he was gracious to them.  Jesus praises the ingenuity of the
steward.  He challenges His disciples to be as energetic in their mission as
the steward was in his.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of us has a mission from GOD.  We are called and sent
forth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(missi [Latin] / apostolein [Greek]) to do GOD’s biding. 
Being a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>missionary is not just the job of a person who leaves his
home country and travels to foreign lands.  All of us are to be missionaries,
or a more recent title, missional/missionary disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on how dedicated I am to the mission that GOD
has given me, 633..I realize that I have not always had the enthusiasm that I
should have in sharing the Gospel (GOoD News).  I have not been as inventive,
calculating, or dedicated in living out my mission as the steward in the
parable was in planning for his future.  I must be willing to put every thought
and effort into proclaiming the message of salvation as far as I possibly can. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That does not mean I have to be “preachy” or “overpowering,”
but I do need to think about how I can best bring the Truth of the Gospel to
others.  I can do this first and foremost by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the way I model the GOoD News in my lifestyle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of us has opportunities each and every day to announce
the GOoD News by the way we treat others. People should sense that we are
committed to our mission of being heralds of the Gospel. It should be obvious
that we are dedicated to what we believe, and we should want to share it with
others, not in a judgmental way, but in a way that shows we are excited and
enthused (“in GOD”) with our faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is then that we can join the psalmist and pray:  “All the
ends of the earth have seen the salvation by our GOD.  Sing joyfully to the
LORD,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all you lands; break into song; sing praise.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What are my thoughts
about my being a missionary or missional/missionary disciple? Do I sense that I
am called to the mission of sharing GOD’s GOoD News with others by the way I
treat them? Is it obvious to others by my actions what my mission is:  to share
the Gospel? How can I be more enthusiastic in living out my mission?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all missions and missionaries. 
Through Your GOoDness You call us to not only hear and experience Your GOoD
News, but to be sent out to proclaim it to others.  At times we have failed to
dedicate ourselves to the mission You have given us.  We have not been fully
conscious of how we can share Your message with others. Continue to challenge
us as Your Son challenged His disciples in today’s Gospel. May we go forth as
Your missionaries to those to whom You send us each and every day.  We lift
this prayer of praise and glory to You in the name of our Master-Teacher and
Lord, Jesus, Your Son, Who sends us forth as His apostles/missionaries and Who
has come to us as the One Whom You have sent.  He it is Who has made the
message of salvation possible by His teaching and ministry, His death and
resurrection, and He is the One Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed John Duns Scotus:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-john-duns-scotus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Romans 16: 3-9, 16, 22-27;        Psalm 145: 2-3,
4-5, 10-11;        Luke 16: 9-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Serving GOD is the call of all who follow the ways of the
Lord Jesus.  Saint Paul summarizes his whole letter: GOD has revealed the
divine mystery to all who are willing to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus
in faith.  The psalmist urges all things and every person to praise the LORD in
response to all that GOD has done.  In the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel today, Jesus urges His disciples to serve only GOD
and not make money or fame their master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul concludes his Letter to the Romans by sending
greetings to the faithful in Rome, some of whom he has known and others about whom
he only has heard.  After this greeting, he goes on to summarize what he had
written about in the rest of his letter:  GOD, through Jesus, has made the
message of salvation known.  This GOoD News is able to be grasped by not only
the Jews but by all people through faith.  The purpose of the divine revelation
is the glorification of the majesty and mastery of GOD over all peoples and
things.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial psalm today is a proclamation of praise of
the majesty of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only fitting response to the benevolence of GOD is to
give thanks to the LORD especially by exalting the great deeds GOD has done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even though the words of Jesus in the Gospel today are
addressed first to His disciples, the Pharisees also hear His message and are
upset at His teaching.  Jesus tells His followers that they can only have one
thing (or Person) take the center stage</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in their lives.  GOD can be the only master they serve,
otherwise they will be enslaved by whatever they make their priority.  If they
seek wealth or fame, they will have to serve that master and not be free.  It
is only when one completely submits to GOD that one has the freedom to live
with a wealth that is beyond this world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember when I worked in Youth Ministry over 40 years ago
in Lake</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tahoe, one of the adult leaders used an imagery that has
still stuck with me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She asked the teenagers what did they value most in life. 
Some gave responses such as “family,” or “a future, good job.”  Others
responded, “doing well in school,” while some said, “having fun” or “friends.” 
The leader wrote down all the values that the various youth had mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She drew a circle and put a chair in the middle of the
circle.  She then asked the teenagers, “Who or what is on the throne of your
life?”  This</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>woman then rephrased the question, “What is the most
important value in your life?”  Whatever takes priority is what we place on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the throne of our lives and that is what or Whom we serve
and that is what or Who controls what we do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyone or anything that we place on the throne of our lives
has power over us.  It can lead us to serve that which or Who is in the center
of our lives.  We lose our freedom when we serve anything or anyone except the
Lord Jesus.  When we place Jesus on the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>throne of our lives, we end up being liberated to act as
disciples of the Lord Jesus.  We are empowered to act like</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus and work for the GOoD of others and of ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There have been times in my life when I have enthroned
certain people or values and therefore had to remove the Lord Jesus from the
center of my life.  One of the values that I put on the chair in the middle of
my circle was popularity.  I wanted people to like me.  It forced me to be a
people pleaser.  I failed in that, at least in my own mind, because I could not
make all people happy all the time.  I ended up burning myself out as I tried
to do things that would make other people like me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is only when I re-establish the supremacy of the Lord
Jesus in my life that I was set free.  I don’t worry about what other people
think of me.  I continue to be of assistance to others, not so that they will
like me, but because I know that is what the Lord Jesus is asking of me.  I am
seeking to serve GOD by helping others and doing what is for their GOoD.  As I
continue to keep Lord Jesus on the throne of my life, I can act in a way that
is pleasing to GOD and I can join the psalmist in praising GOD, “Every day will
I bless You, LORD, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.  Great are You
and highly to be praised; Your greatness is unsearchable.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Who or what is
sitting on the throne in the center of my life? What demands are made of me by
whatever (or whoever) is the center of my life? Do I feel enslaved to that
which or who is at the center, or do I feel liberated by placing the Lord Jesus
and His Abba-Father at the center of my life?  What can I do to help others see
that which they value most in their lives and help them center in on the Lord
Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all.  Through Your GOoDness we
are empowered to be not only Your servants, but also co-workers with Your Son
in the service of others.  Yet in our desire to please ourselves, we have
placed other values on the throne of our lives and have become enslaved to
seeking those values. Continue to extend Your forgiveness to us and help us to
remove from the center of our lives all that is not of You.  May we follow the
example of Your Son, Jesus, the Master-Teacher and Lord.  Fill us with the
gifts of Your Holy Spirit so that we can have the strength, wisdom, and love to
go out and serve You by caring for our brothers and sisters.  We make this
prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Whom You have set over us as our
Master.  He is the One Who is bringing us into Your presence through His life,
death, and resurrection, and Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dedication of St. John Lateran: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/dedication-of-saint-john-lateran-basilica</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Ezekiel 47: 1-2, 8-9, 12;     Psalm 46: 2-3, 5-6;
8-9;     1 Cor. 3: 9c-11, 16-17;      John 2: 13-22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today speak about GOD’s House or Temple. It is
the place where the presence of GOD can be experienced in a very strong way.
Ezekiel experiences it when an angel brings him to the Temple in Jerusalem, and
he explores the House of GOD and sees the water flowing from the Temple. The
psalm continues the theme of life-giving water flowing from the Temple of the
LORD that was mentioned in the First Reading. St. Paul also speaks of life</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>coming from the Edifice of GOD as he reminds the community
at Corinth that they are the living Temple of GOD built on the foundation of
Jesus. In the Gospel, after Jesus cleanses the Temple of all the buying and
selling, He relates the Temple to His Body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ezekiel’s vision of the Temple corresponds to the actual
geography of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The way the Temple is situated on
the hills of Jerusalem, the main drainage from the Temple would flow out of the
eastern side, down the Kidron Valley to the south, and make its way eventually
to the Jordan River that flows into the Dead Sea. As the water flows from the
Temple, it gives life to the plants and animals along its banks. It even
refreshes the salty water of the Dead Sea at the point where the river empties
into the Dead Sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm reflects on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>water as a source of joy for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy City and Temple of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD. For Jewish people, whose ancestors traveled through the
desert, water and sources of water were important, even sacred. Coming to a
water source was truly a blessing from GOD. Thus, GOD’s Temple is appropriately
linked to water, and water would gladden the city of GOD and make GOD’s
presence felt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul speaks about the new Temple
of GOD, not built with inanimate stones, but with animated (Spirited) persons.
The foundation of this edifice is Jesus Himself. It is in this Temple of GOD
(the people of the Church) that GOD’s presence can be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus demonstrates His respect for the
physical building in which GOD’s presence can be experienced in a special
manner. Merchants have taken over the outer courts of the Great Temple and have
turned it into a marketplace. Justifiably, Jesus is angered by the desecration
of the place where GOD’s presence strongly dwells. When Jesus is challenged to
give a sign that will show that He has authority to cleanse the Temple, Jesus
speaks of a different dwelling place of GOD’s presence. If this new Temple
would be destroyed, Jesus will have it restored in three days. This new,
different, and better Temple of GOD is Jesus Himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, the Church of Rome (not just the city of Rome but all
the communities that are united with the Bishop of Rome) celebrate the
dedication of the official Church of the Bishop of Rome – St. John Lateran. The
Basilica of St. Peter’s is not the official church of the Bishop of Rome. The
Church of St. John, that was originally built by the Roman Emperor Constantine
on the Lateran Hill, is the main church of the Pope as Bishop of Rome. Its
dedication marked a special time in the history of Christianity. Believers
began to celebrate their worship service in a public and open building. This
was one of the places where the first buildings were erected as a public place
where the Church (“Assembly” of Believers) could meet and give open and visible
praise to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the universal (catholic) Church celebrates the dedication
of this edifice, it recalls that the building is only a sign of the more
authentic dwelling place of GOD – Jesus – and through Jesus, His Mystical Body
– the Body of Believers. We are reminded that just as Ezekiel saw life-giving
water flow from the Temple of GOD, so the life-giving water flowing from the
pierced side of Jesus and from His Body, gives life to the new House of GOD
(the Church - the People of GOD). The image of water as seen by Ezekiel
corresponds with the cleansing water of Baptism that flows through the Church
and gives life to all who are plunged (baptizo) into the life of Jesus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we reflect not on a bunch of stones that make up a
particular building in the city of Rome, but we think about all who make up the
Church (the Body of Christ). We are the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>living stones which/who have come together so that GOD may
have a dwelling place on earth. Just as Jesus was the new Temple, destroyed and
rebuilt in three days, so we, too, as members of Jesus’ Body, are the new place
where GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>makes the divine presence felt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember one sermon that I heard that remarked that today
is really the end of the Feast of All Hallows. It is the last day of the major
celebration of the Communion of Saints.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Eight days ago, we celebrated the Feast of the Church
Triumphant (those who are the heavenly branch of the Communion of Saints). Last
Thursday, November 2, was the Feast of All Souls, when we reflected on, and
prayed for, the Church Suffering, those in transition from this life to eternal
life. Today we celebrate our feast day, the feast of the Church Militant. That
is who we are. We are still on earth, fighting the battle, being part of the
earthly living Church of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we remember that we are saints (still in the process
of being formed). The construction of the Church is not yet finished. We still
need some of the finishing touches completed (some of us still have a lot of
work that needs to be done by us and within us). We are the dwelling place of
GOD as long as we are built on the foundation of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All this reminds me of my obligation to be as GOoD a
dwelling place for GOD as I can be. People should be able to experience the
presence of GOD when they are near me, not because I am holy in and of myself,
but because GOD is holy and GOD has chosen to make a dwelling place within me.
I should be careful not to clutter up my life with “stuff” that has nothing to
do with GOD (as the people in the Gospel cluttered up the Temple). I should be
cautious that I don’t become involved in making GOD’s dwelling place a
marketplace. It is when I am aware of GOD’s dwelling in me that I can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>say with the psalmist today: “GOD is in [our] midst!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of the
“Church,” what images come to mind? Do I sense that I am part of the Church –
the Body of Christ? Can people experience the holiness and presence of GOD when
they meet me?  How can I better reflect GOD’s presence to other? How can I be
supportive of the other parts (people) in Temple of GOD and edify them as part
of the Church?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, heavenly LORD. Through Your
GOoDness, You desire to dwell among us because You want to be in relationship
with us. Throughout human history You have manifested Your presence in many
ways. We have tried to give You glory by erecting a physical dwelling place in
which You could manifest Yourself. At times we have missed the point of having
an edifice for You. We have constructed elaborate structures and have failed to
recognize Your presence in our midst, even outside of the majestic edifices.
The greatest sign of Your abiding with us is Jesus, Your Son. He came to make
Your loving presence even more obvious and visible. Even with Jesus in our
midst, we have still failed to see You by our sides. We ask that through the
power of Your Holy Spirit we may be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>more open to Your dwelling with us and in us. May we become
part of the divine edifice, the Church, the Body of Christ Jesus. May people
come to realize that You are with them through their being Your dwelling place
on earth. We thank You for allowing us to be part of Your Communion of Saints.
Form us into that part of Your Temple that can best give You all the glory and
praise that You deserve. We make this prayer in the name of Your Ultimate
Dwelling Among Us – Jesus. He is our Lord and Savior, He is the Foundation of
Your Temple, He is one with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 1: 1-7;               Psalm 139: 1b-3,
4-6, 7-8, 9-10;                   Luke 17: 1-6</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today are filled with wisdom and sound advice
for living out our faith.  Today we begin reading from the Book of Wisdom, and
we are reminded that wisdom is a sign of a life that is in touch with GOD.  The
Responsorial Psalm describes the wisdom of GOD and GOD’s closeness to us at all
times.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks of the need of His disciples to not only
live a GOoD life, but also to also avoid scandalizing others as they grow in
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Book of Wisdom, which is part of the Catholic Bible and
which will be the source of the First Reading for most of this week, presents
us with practical advice on how to live our lives.  Wisdom can be seen as
sharing in the life of GOD and having our relationship with GOD affect what we
do. Justice flows from applying wisdom to our daily life.  As one reflects on
how GOD is present in one’s daily living, it changes how one should act. Wisdom
is the living out of the awareness of GOD’s presence.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>opposite of wisdom, that is not being aware of GOD’s
presence, leads to evil and injustice and sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm parallels the line in the First
Reading that says, “GOD is the witness of the inmost self and the sure observer
of the heart and the listener to the tongue.”  The psalmist is aware of how
much GOD knows humans, especially himself as an individual and writer of the
psalms.  The LORD has more knowledge of us than we have of ourselves.  We can
never flee from GOD’s presence, for GOD is always with us, not to record every
bad thought or deed,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>but to guide us and protect us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today presents a few ideas for us to think about
and implement. First, Jesus warns His disciples not to be the source of scandal
for others. Occasions of sin are all around us in the world, but the disciples
should not be such an occasion of sin for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speaking of sin, Jesus goes on to inform His disciples that
they should be willing to point out sin to another believer, not in a manner
that condemns the sinner, but in the hope that it will move the sinner to
repent.  The mention of repenting leads to Jesus’ commanding His disciples to
extend forgiveness repeatedly to those who sin against them.  Summarizing what
should be the driving force for the disciples, Jesus urges them to put their
faith into practice, and great things will happen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I see a common thread
being woven through them.  It is the thread of the awareness of the presence of
GOD. Just as a single thread is not always obvious in a tapestry, the removal
of that thread causes the tapestry to lack wholeness.  Being aware of GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>presence may not always be obvious to the outside observer
of our actions.  Yet, if our awareness of GOD is not present, it will be
obvious to the outside observer that something is missing from our lives, that
we are not whole, that there is a falseness to our actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more we can be conscious of GOD’s presence with us at
every moment of our lives, the more we will act with the wisdom that comes from
GOD alone.  We must continually apply GOD’s wisdom to our actions.  One such
reminder of that is in the four letters, WWJD that stand for “What Would Jesus
Do?”  or “What Would Jesus Have Me Do? - WWJHMD?”  If we can ask ourselves that
question before we engage in an activity, we would be guided to do the wise,
just, righteous, faith-filled deed.  We would also avoid giving scandal to
others, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for we would be conscious of how our actions would affect
the faith journey of others.  Thinking about WWJHMD would also makes us aware
of the sinfulness of others and move us to be compassionate toward the sinner
and willing to forgives those who sin against us, just as Jesus did and
continues to do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, being aware of GOD’s presence in our lives can
increase the faith, that is GOD’s life within us.  A few years ago, a brother
and sister in the same family (who are friends of mine) spoke at their church
about what faith is.  Although I was not able to attend their sharing their
words of wisdom that they addressed to the community of faith gathered at their
church, I was informed of what they said.  These two, who were teenagers at the
time, addressed the issue of faith in their lives from different perspectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The younger male spoke how he had just entered a Christian
high school and his primary focus was not on his studies, nor being on the
football team, but finding a girlfriend.  He went on to say it wasn’t until
another friend said that his focus was out of place (since he was not seeking
first a faith relationship with GOD), that he realized he was not doing the
right thing because his first and foremost concern was not realizing GOD was
with him.  If he focused on the GOD Who was with him, then he would realize
that the GOD Who was with him would provide for him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The older sister spoke about struggles she had in her life. 
She pointed out that faith is not always a comfortable thing.  In fact, she
compared faith to a war going on within her.  When she lacked faith, she made
poor decision about health issues and other aspects of her life.  It was only
when she “chose life” that she realized that choosing life meant being aware of
GOD’s presence and GOD’s action in her life and that led to an increase in
faith – a closer relationship with GOD and a more positive relationship with
others and a better perspective on what focus she should have in life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is when we have the wisdom of knowing GOD is with us,
that we can act in a way that gives glory to GOD. That is what true faith is. 
That is what is reflected in the words of today’s psalm, “If I take the wings
of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>dawn, if I settle at the farthest limits of the sea, even
there Your hand shall guide me, and Your right hand hold me fast.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What is wisdom to
me?   Do I see a link between having wisdom and being aware of the presence of
GOD?  How often do I turn to the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit in order to
seek divine wisdom before making decisions in my life? How can I be a source of
wisdom and a reminder to others of GOD’s presence with them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all wisdom.  Through Your
GOoDness, we have the ability to partake of Your wisdom by our focusing our
attention on Your presence with us.  Yet, at times we have forgotten about Your
always being with us.  We have focused on foolish ways that lead us into sin. 
We ask that You continue to share with us the forgiveness that Jesus brought to
us through His death and resurrection.  As Your Holy Spirit continues to touch
our lives, helps us to accept the gifts of wisdom, understanding, faith,
counsel, and the ability to accept and give forgiveness.  Help us to ask
ourselves “What Would Jesus Have Me Do?” whenever we need to make decisions,
whether they be big or small.  And may we continue to give You all our praise,
glory, and thanks as we journey along the Way to You.  We make this prayer in
the name of Your Son, Jesus, Who is Wisdom Incarnate, the Way, the Truth, and
the Life.  He is the One Who has brought us into Your presence through His
life, death, and resurrection, and Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 2: 23-3: 9;       Psalm 34: 2-3, 16-17,
18-19;       Luke 17: 7-10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus reminds us that we are called to be the
servants of GOD and GOD’s people.  The First Reading reminds us that if we are
faithful to our calling of being GOD’s servants, we will be declared just and
GOD will give us a better life after our life here on earth.  The Responsorial
Psalm proclaims that GOD hears the cry of the just and answers them compassionately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a passage that is often read at Catholic funerals, the
author of the Book of Wisdom reflects on death and the transition that takes
place at death for those who are just.  It has always been GOD’s will that we
should share in the eternal life that GOD lives.  Yet, because of sin, death
became a part of the life of humans.  For those who have no hope and belief in
eternal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life, death can seem a senseless tragedy.  For those,
however, who have been faithful to GOD, death is the transition to life with
GOD.  The author</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminds us that the just individuals are in peace – GOD’s
peace (Shalom), not because of their deeds, but because GOD is the GOD of peace
and shares that peace with those who respond to GOD’s call.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist praises the LORD because GOD cares for all
people, especially those who are just and seek to do GOD’s will.  When tragedy
strikes the lives of those who trust in GOD, the LORD answers their prayer and
tends to their needs.  GOD identifies with the Anawim (literally, the “bent over”
or “overburdened” people).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus speaks to His disciples using a parable
of a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>master who has servants.  The job of the servants is to do
the will of their master.  Even after working hard in the fields all day, the
servants can expect to return to the master’s home and then prepare and serve
the master his dinner, and only later eat themselves.  Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wants His disciples to be servants, not only servants of His
Abba-Father, but servants of one another and all peoples.  It is in service
that we demonstrate how merciful and loving GOD has been to us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings and American holiday of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Veteran’s Day that we celebrate today, I recall that we are
asked to pause and remember those who lived, and in some cases died, in service
of our country and all its peoples.  Our veterans have been, and continue to
be, people of service.  They have fought for our freedom,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>peace, and life.  They were willing to go into battle with
the hope that they would be victorious, in the long run, even if they lost some
battles along the way.  We owe them our gratitude and thanks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Service, however, is not limited to the men and women of the
armed services.  It is the calling of everyone who wants to be a disciple of
the Lord Jesus.  The service into which we have been drafted, or voluntarily
enlisted, is the service of the Lord Jesus.  Just like the individuals who
serve in military, we are called to prepare for being, and then be, semper
fi(delis) – “always faithful.”  We must be faithful to the GOD Who wants all
people to experience true freedom, peace, and eternal life.  Like the armed
service men and women of our country, we can expect to face an enemy who will
tax our abilities and stamina.  Our battles may be difficult and costly.  We
are, however, assured that the ultimate victory is ours, or more exactly, the
ultimate victory is the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we can truly be semper fidelis, then the Lord Jesus will
call us “the elect,” “the just,” the “GOoD and faithful servants.” Yes, like
the servants in the Gospel today, we may say, we are only doing what we have
been obliged to do.  Our Master- Teacher, however, will then welcome us into
the eternal </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>banquet hall where we will be served by our Master.  It is
then the words of the First Reading will echo in our lives, “Those who trust in
the GOD shall understand truth, and the faithful shall abide with GOD in love:
because grace and mercy are with GOD’s holy ones, and GOD’s care is with the
elect.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Do I see my life as
a follower of the Lord Jesus as a call to be in the service of others?  What
particular service can I do for the sake of others? When I think of my life and
my death, do I realize that the Lord Jesus is calling me to be a part of the
ultimate victory banquet and be at peace in the house of our GOD? Or does my
life signify that I desire to be apart from GOD and the heavenly victory
banquet? How can I better reflect to others my desire to be of service to the
Lord Jesus by serving them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all who give their lives in
service of others.  Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son to be the
Servant par excellence.  He came not to be served, but to serve and to give His
life in ransom for the multitude.  Jesus calls upon all His disciples to be in
service to others.  As we recall all those who have been in the service,
whether that be military service of our country or in the Lord Jesus’ service,
we ask You to bless them for their willingness to do what is necessary for the
GOoD of others.  We can also recall times when we have failed to serve those
whom You have placed into our care.  We seek Your pardon and forgiveness for
ourselves, and the peace for those who have sought to serve others.  We make
this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Who is Your Servant and Son, and
Who calls us to continue His service/ministry to others.  He is the source of
true freedom, peace, and life, which He has gained through His life, death, and
resurrection, and He it is Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 6: 1-11;                        Psalm 82:
3-4, 6-7;                       Luke 17: 11-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is so easy to let life get out of the proper
perspective.  The First Reading today is a warning to those in authority that
they must realize that they will be held accountable to GOD for how they used
the power that they are given.  The Responsorial Psalm is addressed to the
“princes” of the people, reminding them that they are not more the children of
GOD than the poor and lowly.  In the Gospel, after Jesus has healed ten lepers,
only one came back to express thanks to GOD, and that one was the foreigner
among them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from Wisdom is addressed to rulers and judges of
the world.  Those who have been given authority must exercise it in a way that
shows they are concerned for those who are under their care.  GOD will be more
lenient when it comes to pardoning the sinfulness of the lowly than in
pardoning those who have usurped their power for their own sake rather than for
the GOoD of those whom they are called to serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm continues this admonition to those who are
leaders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “princes” or tribal lords are challenged to act with
justice and fairness, for GOD is aware of the needs of the lowly and will be
upset if those in control do not meet those needs.  The psalmist reminds the
“princes” that they, too, are also children of GOD and are not more important
than those whom they lead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus continues His journey in the Gospel, ten lepers
call out to Him and ask for His assistance.  Knowing that they were not allowed
to be where the “clean” or healthy people were, they keep their distance and
hope that Jesus will do something to remedy their plight.  Compassionately,
Jesus knows their desire and tells them to go to the priests who can declare
lepers “clean” and able to rejoin the people.  Only one of the healed lepers
returns to Jesus to say, “thank you.”  And this one was a Samaritan, a non-Jew,
in fact, one considered worse than a heathen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>     In some ways we can probably identify with the
characters in today’s readings.  Many of us have been placed in positions of
authority, whether that be in our families or at our work or at church or in
community.  It is human nature to attribute our being in leadership to our own
abilities and talents, and to be tempted to use the authority we have for our
own benefit and advancement.  The warning spoken centuries ago applies to us just
as much at it did in the time it was given.  We will be held accountable for
the way we use the positions we have been given. In fact, we who are in places
of authority will be required to explain how we treat those under us more than
those under us will be expected to give an accounting of how they responded to
those in power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe some of us can more easily identify with the lepers,
not because of any disease we have, but because we feel burdened by physical,
emotional, financial, or intellectual situations we are in.  We, like the
lepers, call out for Jesus’ help.  We want Jesus to perform some miracle to
remove the conditions that restrict our feeling a part of the society from
which we have been ostracized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge I see for myself (and others) is two-fold. 
First of all, we need to take the situation in which we find ourselves and use
the situation in a way that shows that we realize GOD loves us and expects us
to do the right thing.  The second part is to be grateful for what GOD has done
for us, whether it is GOD’s placing us in a position of leadership or touching
our lives with the divine healing presence.  Both aspects of the challenge deal
with the realization of our relationship with GOD.  GOD is with us and in
control no matter if we are in authority </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>or in desperate circumstances.  GOD is willing to bring us
salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) if we but acknowledge the divine
sovereignty over us.  And the most important point is that we must be grateful
for however GOD touches our lives.  We must not just turn to GOD when we are in
need.  We must turn to GOD in thanksgiving at all times, for GOD is the
ultimate authority in our lives and GOD desires the best for us and those
around us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we can do this, we will be able to hear the words of
GOD spoken to us as much as to the people in today’s psalm. It will not be
words of warning to us as much as words of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>endearment:  “You are divine (you have the divine life
within you), all of you children of GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Am I always
conscious of GOD’s presence in my life? Do I realize that any authority or
position I have is because GOD has graced me and will expect me to deal
compassionately with those who are placed in my care? Am I able to not only cry
out to GOD for help, but also express my thanksgiving to GOD for acting
powerfully in my life? For what blessings can I give thanks to GOD today? How
can I help others to realize the presence of GOD in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all power and might.  Through
Your GOoDness You have shared Your power with those in authority.  You have
also allowed people to experience pain and difficulties so that they could be
touched by Your compassionate and loving hands.  Yet, because of our fallen
human nature, we abuse the position in which You have placed us.  We also only
call upon You when we hope to have a miracle, and then we fail to express our
gratitude.  For our failures and sins, especially for not acknowledging Your
sovereignty over us, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Through the
continued outpouring of Your Holy Spirit, helps us look to Jesus, Your Son, and
our Brother, as the example of leadership and the One to Whom we express our
thanks as He touches our lives with healing, compassion, and love.  We lift up
this prayer of praise, glory, and thanks</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to You, together with Your Son and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-frances-xavier-cabrini</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 7: 22b – 8: 1;      Psalm 119: 89, 90, 91,
130, 135, 175;           Luke 17: 20-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s focus, for me, is on GOD’s presence as manifest
first by Wisdom and then by Reign of GOD already among us.  Both readings use
lightning/light as a symbol of Wisdom and the Reign of GOD.  The First Reading
extols the qualities of Wisdom and links Wisdom to GOD.  The Responsorial Psalm
parallels the focus on Wisdom by speaking of the importance and effect of the
Word of GOD.  The Gospel presents the Incarnate Word of GOD (Jesus) speaking to
both the Pharisees and His disciples about the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>coming of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wisdom is seen as the handmaid of GOD. She is present with
GOD and is treasured by those who seek to be in relationship with GOD.  Those
who are in Wisdom’s company exhibit such qualities as enlightenment, holiness,
kindness, peace, stability.  Thus, a person who desires to live a GOD-graced
life will be accustomed to live with Wisdom.  All admirable character traits
flow from Wisdom. GOD blesses those who seek Wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parallel to Wisdom is the Word of GOD as described in
today’s Responsorial Psalm.  The Word of GOD gives understanding to the simple
and guides the way of those who seek to walk in GOD’s path.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus responds to the questions of the
Pharisees concerning the coming of the Reign of GOD. J esus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>announces that the Reign of GOD has already begun and is in
their midst, if they but open their minds and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hearts to it.  The fullness of the Reign of GOD will not
come</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>about until the Son of Man returns in final glory.  In the
meantime, there will be trying days as the disciples of Jesus await His return.
Pondering the readings today, I realize how important it is to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>focus on GOD’s presence with us at this very moment.  When
we are aware of GOD-with-us (“Emmanuel”) we share in the Wisdom that flows from
GOD. We act not with human intelligence (or lack thereof), nor out of our base
nature, but we act motivated by knowing that GOD is at our side.  That is the
beginning of the Reign of GOD in our lives here and now.  This is Wisdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, the fullness of the Reign of GOD is yet to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are in the “already, but not yet” time.  We can
experience the foretaste of the Reign of GOD right now.  What can guide us in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>our living within the Reign of GOD is Wisdom.  Wisdom is not
primarily an intellectual thing.  Wisdom is the ability to keep our eyes
focused on, and ears open to, what GOD is doing presently and then acting with
the hope (assurance, not wishful thinking) that GOD will keep the divine
promises and welcome us into the fullness of the Reign. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Practically, for me, that means I must act in a way that
manifests my being part of the Reign of GOD – and acting with Wisdom. 
Obviously, the qualities discussed in the First Reading should be those that I
try to practice in my life:  holiness, kindness, peace, stability,
enlightenment.  I must hold up each of my thoughts and deeds to the pure Light
of Wisdom.  I must examine my behavior and discern what will most fully
proclaim the Reign of GOD that is not only here for me, but also for others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I was driving home once, we had a terrific thunder and
lightning storm.  What excited me was the brilliance of the lightning flashes. 
The pure white light that illuminated the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sky and the land is a fitting symbol of way Wisdom can
enlighten my life and remind me of the awesome power of GOD’s presence with
me.  The power and force of the lightning are obviously not as powerful as the
sun, but its closeness to us and the way its thunder can rumble through the air
can remind us of the fact that GOD’s power is ever present.  Just as lightning
is not as mighty as the sun, (that is not as powerful as GOD), and just as we
could not draw as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>close to the sun and still live as earthlings, so the Reign
of GOD that we experience now is not as majestic as what still lies in store
for us, and it is only once we leave this earthly place (or until Jesus returns
at the end of time) that we will experience the fullness of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is Wisdom to
me?  How do I see Wisdom linked to GOD?  To the Reign of GOD?  What
relationship do I see between Light and Wisdom and the Reign of GOD?  What can
I do to show that I am part of the “already, but not yet” Reign of GOD?  How
can I help others to come to a greater awareness of this Reign of GOD in their
lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all light.  Through Your
GOoDness You have enlightened us not only with visible light, but with the
Light that has come from Your very being and has been enfleshed in Your Son,
Jesus. He truly is the Light.  Often, we have chosen to walk in darkness and
gloom rather than experience the Light that comes from You.  Continue to send
Your Holy Spirit into our lives with the gift of enlightening Wisdom. As we
grow in Your Wisdom, help us to be more conscious of Your presence with us. 
May the flash of lightning and the radiance of the sun remind us of the
fullness of Your Light and Your presence with us.  As we journey back to You,
may we walk as children of the Light, members of Your Reign now.  Help us to
look forward to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fullness of Your enlightening splendor in Your heavenly
Reign.  We lift up this prayer of praise and glory to You now and always as we
join with the Light (Your Son, Jesus) Who continues to call us to follow Him. 
He is our Master-Teacher and Lord, Who has saved us by His death and
resurrection, and Who is now living and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 13: 1-9;        Psalm 19: 2-3,
4-5b;         Luke 17: 26-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings present a challenge to us, as is very often the
case with GOD’s Word.  First of all, the Book of Wisdom questions us with the
paraphrased words:  “If we can admire the beauty, power, and awesomeness of
creation, should we not even more admire the Creator?”  The Responsorial gives
testimony that all creation proclaims the glory of GOD.  Jesus in the Gospel
warns His disciples that the end times will come upon the world at a time when
many are not prepared.  The disciples, like many people today, wonder about
Jesus’ words of admonition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The author of the Book of Wisdom chides the readers of the book
to look beyond the beauty, power, and majesty of the created world.  If people
can see the divine element in these works of nature, should they not look
beyond them to the Creator of nature?   This same sort of argument has been</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>used by St. Paul (in his Letter to the Romans) and St.
Thomas</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Aquinas in his writings, and St. Francis of Assisi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist uses other words to get across the same idea as
the First Reading.  All creation, by its very nature, proclaims the glory of
GOD. That which is created reflects the glory of the One Who created it and
gave beauty</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and power to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His warning to His disciples
about the end of time.  Comparing the suddenness and completeness of GOD’s
action at the time of Noah and the flood, and at the time of the destruction of
Sodom and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gomorrah, Jesus says a similar swift and unannounced (at
least to most people) happening will take place at the end time.  Jesus’
disciples are left pondering and questioning His pronouncements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the First Reading, I remember some of St.
Thomas Aquinas’ descriptions of the way we can know about the existence of GOD
from nature.  One of his explanations is the order and design in the world that
imply One Who orders and designs.  I am reminded of great scholars of science
speaking about the organization and patterns in nature, but refusing to
acknowledge that such complex design means there must</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be an Intelligent Designer.  We even describe phenomena of
nature as “acts of GOD.”  Yet some people will not admit that GOD is the
Creator of all creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a similar vein, I am amazed by people who continually
proclaim the imminent end of the world.  They are willing to pinpoint the year,
month, and even date.  (Remember how many forecasts there were over two decades
ago about the world ending in the year 2000?)  There were even movies and a lot
of television programs that said that ancient native people of the world and
Nostradamus pointed to the year 2012 as the end of the world, and even more
precisely they said it would happen on December 21, 2012.  In regard to
September of 2015, there were two predictions of the end of the world:  one by
an asteroid hitting near London, and another with the “Blood Moon” at the end
of that month.  Others said the Covid-19 pandemic was the beginning of the
end.  But, here we are in November 2023, and the world has not ended – yet. 
Yes, the world will end.  Yes, some people </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will not be prepared when it happens.  More important, at
least to me, is how is my relationship with GOD right now, and how I am
preparing to meet the Lord Jesus when He comes for me at the end of my time on
earth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More realistic in my mind, especially after the experiences
I have had over the past few years, is the fact that I realize that I will die. 
I have already lived longer than I ever expected.  I presume that I have less
time left on this earth than I have already spent here.  The question I must
ask myself each day, in fact every moment of every</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>day, is “Am I ready to meet the Lord Jesus right now?”  I
need only look around me at the ebb and flow of nature, summer changing to
fall, with winter soon to follow, to remind myself that I will not live forever
here on earth.  Also, with all the weather-related problems due to climate
changes, we may wonder if we are going to see the end of our earth during our
lifetime.  A few years ago, at this time of year, as I was driving home, I saw
trees bearing the most beautiful reds, yellows, and oranges that I can ever
remember in Southern California.  It made</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>me give thanks to GOD, the Creator of the beauty in nature. 
The awesomeness of the changes of seasons and the beauty that can be seen are
reminders that I can still give glory to GOD even in the autumn years of my
existence on this planet, or the autumn years of our planet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My whole life should be a proclamation of the glory of GOD. 
Just as people see creation (nature) and are awestruck, and hopefully think
about the Creator, so my life should be an opportunity for people to come to a
better understanding of Who GOD is as they reflect GOD’s essence and love.  If
we can be a source of people praising GOD, then we are ready to meet the Lord
Jesus at the end of time (either our own personal time or the world’s time). 
May I join all of GOD’s creation in echoing the words of the psalm today:  “The
heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament proclaims the LORD’s
handiwork.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When have I been
most struck by the majesty and glory of creation?  Did it lead me to a greater
understanding or appreciation of the Creator?  Was I moved to give glory to GOD
for what GOD has done in creation?  Am I ready to meet the Lord Jesus when the
time comes (either my own personal time or the cumulative time of all earthly
creation)?  What can I do to help others give glory to GOD as I give better
witness to the Creator and to the need to be ready for the end time?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all You have created.  Through
Your GOoDness, we have been privileged to reflect on Your beauty, power, and
majesty as we experience the world You have made for us.  At times we become so
enchanted with Your creation, but we have failed to see Your creating hand at
work.  We cling to and desire to stay attached to Your works and do not prepare
ourselves for being attached to You, their Creator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For our misguided attention, we seek Your pardon and
forgiveness.  Your Son has come among us to direct our attention to You and
Your eternal Reign.  Help us join all Your creatures in giving glory and praise
to You, not just now, but also at the time we finish our journey here on earth,
whether individually or as a whole.  To You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we offer this prayer of adoration, praise, and thanks, as we
join with Your Son, Jesus, Who has died and is risen to show His victory over
the force of death, and Who is now living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-albert-the-great</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Wisdom 18: 14-16, 19: 6-9;         Psalm 105:
2-3, 36-37, 42-43;          Luke 18: 1-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is attentive to the needs of those who call upon the
LORD.  The First Reading retells the story of the Exodus.  The Responsorial
Psalm describes the Exodus events as GOD fulfilling the promises made to
Abraham and his descendants.  In the Gospel, Jesus shares a parable and
concludes it by saying that GOD responds to the pleas of the people not because
of the continued supplications, but because GOD loves them and gives them what
is best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s passage from the Book of Wisdom begins by describing
the night of Passover when GOD sent death to the Egyptians.  It then continues
by relating the story of how GOD opened the waters of the Red Sea and allowed
the Chosen People to pass through the sea.  The reading concludes with the
recounting of the people rejoicing that GOD had saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm chosen for today parallels the First Reading in
proclaiming the glory of the LORD for bringing the Chosen People to freedom
through the events of the Exodus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Exodus demonstrates that GOD keeps the divine promises
made to Abraham and his descendants, and that GOD has taken a liking to the
people who call out in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus urges His disciples to be steadfast in
prayer.  To get His point across, He tells the parable of the dishonest judge
who finally gives in to the pleading of a widow because of her non-stop
pestering of the judge.  Jesus ends the Gospel by telling His disciples that
the Heavenly Judge is more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassionate and loving than the dishonest judge and will
respond to the pleas of the those who seek divine help much more willingly, and
without the need for badgering like the widow had done against the earthly
judge.  Yet it also stresses the need for our consistent prayer to, and
relationship with, GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contemplating the readings, especially the Gospel, I am once
again reminded of GOD’s great concern for all people, but especially those who
call upon the Lord Jesus for help.  GOD is more loving and caring than any
earthly parent or authority figure.  GOD wants us to lift up our prayers of
petition to heaven, not because GOD does not know what we need, but because it
shows our reliance on the Lord Jesus and our acknowledgment of our need of
divine help.  GOD has promised to hear our prayers and to be faithful to the
promises of attending to the needs of those who trust in GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second thought that crosses my mind as I reflect on the
readings is the response that we should have as GOD answers our prayers.  The
response</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>should be heartfelt joy and grateful exuberance.  Just as
the Israelites danced and sang for joy as they were released from the slavery
imposed upon them by the Egyptians, especially after they had crossed through
the Sea that then drowned</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the pursuing Egyptian forces, so we, too, should rejoice
with thankful praise and song.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are approaching the American holiday of Thanksgiving
(five days from now).  It is fitting for us to set aside a day on which we can
celebrate with food, fun, and family as we give thanks.  Thanksgiving should
not be just an annual festivity celebrated only once each year.  Rather, it
should be the hallmark of our lives as disciples </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the Lord Jesus.  Each and every day we should reflect how
GOD has touched our lives and we should respond with thankful hearts, joyful
voices, and responsive actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am once again reminded of the meaning of prayer.  We who
use English as our mother tongue have a misunderstanding of the concept of
prayer.  Part of it flows from the derivation of the word “prayer.”  The
English word “pray” means “beg” or “plead” in such as phrases as “pray thee
tell.”  The Hebrew word for “prayer” is berakah, which can be translated as
“bless” or “thank.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The true purpose of prayer is four-fold, only one of which
centers on asking GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for favors.  Prayer is first and foremost  Adoration –
acknowledging GOD for Who GOD is.  The second purpose of prayer is Contrition
or  Confession– admitting who we are in GOD’s sight – that is, that we are
sinners, in need of forgiveness.  The third end of prayer is Thanksgiving –
praising GOD for what GOD has done, is doing, and will continue to do for us. 
The fourth, and not most important, aspect of prayer is Supplication –
presenting our needs to GOD and asking GOD to be faithful to the divine
promises to care for us who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even in our petitioning of GOD for help, we should adore and
thank GOD as we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ask.  We can praise the Lord Jesus for what we believe GOD
will do for us in the particular needs we present.  We can also acknowledge who
we are in relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with GOD – people in need of GOD’s help.  With expectant
gratitude we lift up our concerns to the GOD Who answers our prayer, always
conscious of what is best for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we turn to Jesus’ and His Abba-Father, in unity of the
Holy Spirit, we can truly offer our ACTS of prayer (Adoration,  Contrition or 
Confession,  Thanksgiving, and  Supplication), confident that GOD hears our
voice and responds lovingly and compassionately.  It is thus that we can join
the psalmist today and say, “Sing to the LORD, sing GOD’s praise; proclaim all
the wondrous deeds of the LORD.  Glory in GOD’s holy name; rejoice, O hearts
that seek the LORD!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my
understanding of prayer? Is it merely my sending my requests to GOD? Do I spend
as much time adoring and thank GOD for Who GOD is and what GOD has done for me
and for all humanity? Am I consistent and persistent in my time of prayer, not
to win GOD over to my side, but to be in relationship with my Abba Who happens
to be GOD? How can I demonstrate to others the adoration and thanksgiving
aspects of my prayer life? Am I comfortable praying audibly with others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all praise.  Through Your
GOoDness we are invited to turn to You and present our prayers.  At times we
have focused on prayer as merely the way to get our requests granted, without
acknowledging Who You are.  We have made prayer a means to our end, rather than
a vehicle to praise You and, in doing so, to draw us into a closer relationship
with You.  For the times we have misused the gift of prayer and not given You
the adoration, praise, and thanks that You deserve, we are contrite and seek
Your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>forgiveness.  We come to You, our almighty and loving GOD
and Abba-Father, to give You praise and worship. We admit our sinfulness and
failings.  We lift up to You our gratitude for always being there to hear and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>respond to our every need, even if it is not answered in the
way we want.  Through the example of Your Son, Jesus, and the guidance and
direction of Your Holy Spirit, may we never cease to pray to You.  We make this
prayer of  Adoration,  Contrition,  Thanks, and  Supplication in the name of
Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Lord, Who has died for us, is risen, and
continues to live and reign with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Malachi 3: 19-20a;     Psalm 98: 5-6, 7-8, 9;     
2 Thessalonians 3: 7-12;       Luke 21: 5-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The end is coming!” These words could describe today’s
readings.  What is even more important than the fact that the end is coming?
What is more important is what we do with the time we have until the end. 
Malachi speaks the Word of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the LORD and announces that the day is coming when all will
met with, and receive, their just “rewards.” The psalmist announces that the
LORD is coming to rule the world with justice.  In his Second Letter to the
Thessalonians, St. Paul cautions the Thessalonians that although it is true
that the Lord Jesus is coming, that does not mean that the faithful should sit
around and do nothing, but rather they should do their fair share in the work
that must be done before Jesus returns.  In the Gospel, Jesus predicts the end
of Jerusalem and also the end of the world, and He warns His disciples that
they may have to suffer, even at the hands of family and friends, in their
proclaiming of the GOoD News.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the last book of the Hebrew Scriptures, Malachi (a name
meaning “my messenger”) warns the people that the day of the LORD’s coming is
near. When the LORD comes, the sinful will justly experience the results of
their </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wrongdoings, while those who honor and respect the name of
the LORD will be justly blessed with healing (salus).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Lord comes to rule the earth with justice.”  This
refrain for the Responsorial summarizes the words from Malachi.  The LORD comes
to administer true justice to all peoples. Those who have not lived a faith-filled
life will be judged harshly while the faithful will know the mercy and justice
of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As he writes to the believers in Thessalonika, St. Paul
addresses the misunderstanding and misbehavior of some people in the community.
Some have taken the position that because the Lord Jesus will be coming back
(and quite soon, they believe), then they believe that they do not have to do
anything.  They have refused to work and have spent their time talking about
others rather than working for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the GOoD of the whole.  Paul points to his own actions while
living with them.  He, the Apostle to the Gentiles, never presumed to have
others serve him, even though he was preaching the Gospel.  He earned his way
by working his trade as a tentmaker.  If he, the preacher of the Truth and
proclaimer of the Lord Jesus’ coming,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>worked even while proclaiming the GOoD News, so should all
other believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Luke’s Gospel, Jesus’ words about the destruction of
Jerusalem and the end of the world have a different emphasis than the parallel
reading in Mark 13.  [Part of the reason for this is that Mark wrote before the
destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD, whereas Luke wrote after the destruction of
Jerusalem.]  There seems to be a separation between Jerusalem’s end and the
world’s end.  The period before the final coming of the Lord Jesus will be
marked by wars, natural disasters, and the persecution of the followers of
Jesus.  Jesus urges His disciples not to worry about how they will handle the
suffering because He will give them the strength to deal with their hardships
and the words to say in defense of the Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One could be led to be fearful by the apparent message of
doom and gloom in today’s readings.  Yet the message for those who are
responding to the Lord Jesus is one of encouragement, hope, and even
excitement.  If one has accepted the GOoD News of salvation and patterned one’s
life on living the Gospel, then one is reassured that the end of one’s
existence on this earth (though possibly painful) is not the ultimate destiny
and end of one’s life.  GOD has promised an eternal life of salus (healing,
wholeness, salvation) for those who respond faithfully to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is true that Jesus will come to judge the world with
justice.  Justice implies that </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who have lived a life apart from GOD (a-theos) will be
“allowed” to live all eternity apart from GOD.  Those who have accepted the
Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father into their lives and have striven to reflect the
gift of salvation that they have received will be blessed with a continued
relationship with GOD as they move toward GOD (ad Deum), and for all of their
lives, for ever and ever.  GOD justly judges each person according to what they
have freely chosen to do with the gift of salvation offered to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on heaven and hell, I realize that heaven is
being in relationship with GOD – being in GOD’s presence – without end.  I can
begin that heavenly experience of GOD’s being with me while on earth, even
while suffering and going through all sorts of hardship.  I begin my future
destiny right now by the attitude I have and by the way I live my life in
response to GOD’s graciousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the flip side, hell is being separated from GOD.  This is
not GOD’s choice for our endless existence after death.  Yet</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, just judge that GOD is, will give people what they have
desired and lived in this life.  If individuals have not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>accepted the graces and gifts from GOD and have resolutely
rejected GOD’s GOoD News, and have declared in words and in actions that they
want nothing to do with GOD, GOD grants them their decision by keeping them
apart from GOD for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>all eternity.  Although GOD continues to give mortals
chances to turn to the Lord Jesus throughout their lives on earth, GOD will not
force divine love upon individuals who freely choose to be without GOD.  GOD
will not drag people into the Divine Presence in heaven against their will. 
Hell is the living out of one’s choice to be GODless – forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The choice is ours.  We can accept what GOD has promised and
we can live a life faithful to the Lord Jesus Who loves us, or we can reject
all that GOD offers and spend eternity without GOD.  GOD, the eternal and just
judge, carries out the sentence that we have chosen for ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To accept what GOD offers means we have to work at living it
out in our lives.  That is part of what Paul urges the Thessalonians to do. 
They must work at their faith.  They must not be busybodies who sit around and
criticize others. They must do their fair share in spreading the faith, for the
Lord Jesus is coming, but may not be here immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must live our lives with the realization that we are
facing the end.  Our earthly existence is limited.  We cannot take “it” with
us.  We are going to die and meet the Lord Jesus.  That will be the end of our
life on this earth as we know it. Do our lives demonstrate that we are working
and living for the Lord Jesus, or do they show that we are only concerned about
the here and now and what we can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>get out of it?  We have to make the choice, and our lives
must, and will (now and forever), reflect the choice we make.  And the Lord
Jesus will confirm our choice when we are judged not only at the moment of our
death, but also at the end of time when our choice will be evident to all.  To
quote the words of Deuteronomy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30: 19: “This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses
against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. 
Now choose life, so that you and your children may live.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How do I “picture” heaven
and hell? Do I believe that I can begin the experience of heaven while still on
earth (just as I begin to live a hellish life while on earth)? What choices
have I made in my life that demonstrate that I have chosen to accept the gift
of living in GOD’s presence?  What further choices must I be willing to make? 
How can I help others make choices that reflect the desire to be part of the
heavenly Reign of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, just judge of all who live on
this earth. Through Your GOoDness You offer us a relationship with You through
Your Son, Jesus. You have given us the choice to freely accept this gift or to
reject it. At times we have been so concerned for our earthly existence that we
have given little thought to what You have presented to us. For our lack of
interest in Your gift and for our outright rejection of Your love, we seek Your
forgiveness with contrite and humbled hearts. Through the empowerment of Your
Holy Spirit, give us the strength, joy, courage, and wisdom to fully accept
Your invitation and work to our fullest to further the spread of Your GOoD
News. We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Who has lived and ministered,
died, and rose in order that we might be welcomed into Your eternal presence.
It is He Who now is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:        1 Maccabees 1: 10-15; 41-43, 54-57,
62-63;        Psalm 119: 53, 61, 134, 150, 155, 158; Luke 18: 35-43</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith is vision for the soul.  The First Reading comes from
the First Book of Maccabees and describes the persecution of the Jews by the
Greeks.  As this thirty-third week progresses, we will continue to hear more
about the faith of some of the Jews who are willing to stand up for their
belief, even to the point of dying.  The Responsorial reiterates the thoughts
of the faithful Jews in their hatred for those who abandon their faith.  In the
Gospel, a blind man, seeking to see, calls out to Jesus.  His faith in Jesus
leads him to vision and a new way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although not part of Protestant Bibles except as apocrypha,
The Book of Maccabees relates the story of the faithful Jews during the time of
the Greek occupation of Israel (second century BC[E]).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Greeks, particularly Antiochus Epiphanes (the “Revealing
One”), want to remove all local religions and establish a universal Hellenic
culture based upon Greek mythology and practices.  Many of the Jews in
Jerusalem see that accepting the Greek way of life is financially and
politically advantageous.  They abandon their Jewish traditions and practices,
and even cover over the sign of the commitment to the Jewish faith – their
circumcision – so that they can participate in the Greek style of living.  They
profane the Sabbath by working and they eat pork and other “defiled” food.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On December 6, 167 BC[E], a group of ardent Jews decide to
remain faithful to the belief and practices of their ancestors, even when doing
so is a civil crime punishable by death.  They are particularly vocal in their
hatred of their fellow Jews who have abandoned the practices of the faith and
sold out to the Greek way of living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist today captures the sentiments of the faithful
Jews in their loathing of the apostate fellow countryfolk.  The defection from
the true religion is seen as a direct affront against GOD and rejection of the
salvation that GOD has given to the faithful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is on His way to Jerusalem and passes
through the ancient city of Jericho.  A blind man is aware of a large and
excited crowd gathering along the road.  He asks what is happening and is
informed that Jesus of Nazareth</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is passing by.  Since he has heard of Jesus and His
miraculous healings, he calls out to Jesus.  At first the crowd tries</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to silence the blind man.  As Jesus hears the sightless one
calling out, He orders that man be brought forward.  Jesus asks the man what he
wants Him to do for him.  When the man professes that he wants Jesus to give
him sight, Jesus speaks the healing words, “Have sight, your faith has saved
you.”  The now-seeing man follows Jesus, and praises and thanks are voiced to
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Faith, a gift from GOD, is vision for the soul.  It is the
faith in Jesus’ healing power that enables the blind man to call out and seek
salus (healing, wholeness, and salvation) from Jesus.  He is given not just
physical sight, but also spiritual insight that leads him to follow Jesus.  In
a similar way, the deep faith of the “Maccabean” Jews </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>leads them to see what they must do to experience the true
salus of GOD.  They are willing to put their lives on the line in order to
preserve the traditions and practices of their faith.  The psalmist also speaks
about the relationship of salvation and the practice of faith in the one line
“Far from sinners is salvation, because they seek not Your statutes.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My thoughts on the readings cause me to be challenged to
“see” the faith that I have.  I am called to be “Epiphanes” – the “revealing
one” – in the sense that my faith must be manifested and visible to others. 
Yes, faith deals with my personal relationship with Jesus.  That personal
relationship with Jesus, however, must be visible to others so that they know
were I stand and to Whom I am committed.  I should not cover over and try to
hide my faith so I can blend in with the culture of the day (whether that be
manifested in music, fads, clothing style, political alinement, or desire for
wealth).   I must be understanding of others (the persons themselves), but that
does not mean I have to agree with their choice of lifestyle, especially if it
is diametrically opposed to the vision of the faith that drives my life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My life must be a clear declaration of the faith to which I
am committed.  I do not have to be “preachy” or confrontational, but I cannot
be wish-washy in my assertion of the faith.  I must be willing to risk
persecution and rejection by others as I live out my faith.  The faith I have
in GOD should be obvious by the way I live my faith. And, like the blind man, I
must continue to call out to the Lord Jesus and declare, “Have pity on me. .
.Let me see.”  For my spiritual vision can become clouded and I need to
continue to have it corrected by the Divine Spiritual Ophthalmologist.  And
after my faith journey through this sometimes spiritually un-insightful world,
may I join with the psalmist today and proclaim, “Though the snares of the
wicked are twined about me, Your law I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: Have I ever tried to
cover over the ways of my faith?  Have I wished to join the ways of the
unspiritual because it seemed financially or socially advantageous? When have I
experience a blindness that has prevented me from seeing the ways of the Lord
Jesus clearly? Once I have experienced spiritual insight, what have I done to
show that I wanted to walk with the Lord Jesus? Can people tell to Whom I am
committed and for what I am willing to suffer?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all vision, both physical and
spiritual.  Through Your GOoDness You have given us the gift of faith.  At
times we have refused to accept Your gift of spiritual sight, choosing to
remain in our blindness rather than to see Your Truth.  For the times we have
chosen darkness as opposed to the Light, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness. 
Through Your Son, Jesus, You offer us clear vision, if we put our faith in
Him.  As You continue to guide us by Your Holy Spirit, help us to be visible
signs of our faith relationship with Jesus and with You.  May we boldly manifest
our belief in a way that is both challenging and also inviting to those who do
not yet believe.  And may we always give You the glory, praise, and thanks You
deserve for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>way You work in our lives and open our eyes of faith.  We
make this prayer through Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the Truth and the
Light, Who visibly manifested Your love for us through His ministry, suffering,
death, and resurrection, and Who is now living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Maccabees 6: 18-31;        Psalm 3: 2-3, 4-5, 6-7;         
Luke 19: 1-10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings give us accounts of individuals who were
willing to publicly give witness to their allegiance to GOD.  The First Reading
presents Eleazar, an aged Jewish scribe, who is willing to die rather than
defile himself by eating meat forbidden by the law of GOD.  The Responsorial
Psalm is a declaration of the faith in GOD, even in the face of adversity.  In
the Gospel, Zacchaeus, a tax collector, professes his new found faith and his
purpose of amending the wrongs he had done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The aged Eleazar is respected by his contemporaries.  Yet,
when it comes down to making a choice of adhering to the law or going along
with his friends, he chooses to be faithful to his relationship with GOD.  The
Greek ruler had passed a law that all people had to eat pork, which is against
the Jewish faith.  Eleazar’s friends pull him aside and suggest that he
substitute another meat for pork and therefore obey his conscious and still
appear to be doing what the Greek oppressors requested.  Eleazar stands firm in
his being faithful.  He does not want to give a false impression, especially to
the youth who would think that he had deserted the ways of the Jewish faith. 
He is willing to be flogged to death as a witness to his relationship with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist seems to be in a similar position as Eleazar.
His opponents are threatening him.  Yet like Eleazar, he stands firm with his
faith in GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as Jesus continues His journey to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jerusalem, He passes Jericho.  There, a short tax collector
hears about Jesus’ passing nearby.  The tax collector, named Zacchaeus, has
heard about Jesus, and wants to see Him, but two things prevent Zacchaeus from
seeing Jesus.  First, he is short and cannot see past the crowd of taller
people.  Secondly, since he is a tax collector, he is despised by the people
who refuse to let him get in a position where he can see Jesus.  Using some of
the cleverness he has as a tax collector, but doing something unbecoming for a
man of his position, he runs ahead of the amassing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>crowd and climbs a sycamore tree so he can see Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus pass under the tree, He looks up and spies
Zacchaeus. He calls Zacchaeus by name and orders him to come down from the
tree.  Jesus then informs him that He will be eating at his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>house that day.  At the dinner, Zacchaeus professes his new
found belief in Jesus and shows that he is committed to change in his</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life.  First, he promises to give half of his wealth to the
poor. Secondly, he promises to refund fourfold anyone whom he has cheated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have always liked the story of Zacchaeus.  Zacchaeus seems
to be a man who is determined.  He must not have been that bad of a person,
even if he was a tax collector.  Mathematically at least, he could not have
taken as much of an advantage of people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as some tax collectors (since he first gives half of his
possession to the poor, and then with what is left, he still has enough money
left to repay fourfold anyone he has cheated).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What strikes me about the Gospel story today and also the
other readings is how important it is to be a witness to what we believe.  We
must publically stand up for our faith, as did Eleazar, the psalmist, and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Zacchaeus.  What that literally means is that we have to be
martyrs.   The Greek word martyros means both “martyr” and “witness.” 
Obviously Eleazar gave the ultimate sign of martyrdom by being willing to die
rather than go against his relationship with GOD.  He was offered a way to
apparently please the oppressing rulers of his day and still be true to his
faith.  He could pretend to eat the food required by the occupying forces, but
he could substitute kosher food instead.  Eleazar, however, did not want to
give the wrong impression to anyone, especially to the youth.  His commitment
to GOD and his faith had to be honestly and publically witnessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to see Jesus, Zacchaeus had first gone out on a
limb both literally and figuratively.  After Jesus was willing to be his
companion and break bread in his house, he also publically gave witness to his
new found faith in Jesus by proclaiming his willingness to forsake his wealth
in order to be a disciple.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In recent years, there has been a multitude of murders on
our American school campus, theaters, shopping malls, and churches.  In a few
of these brutal attacks, the perpetrators have particularly targeted
Christians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before the shooters have killed the victims, they would
often ask, “Are you a Christian?”  When the victim boldly replied in the
affirmative the shooters raised their guns and shot the professing Christians. 
In these cases, these youthful victims were willing to stand up for their faith
and give witness to others of what their faith meant to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question before me is:  am I at least willing to go out
on a limb to show my relationship with Jesus? And since Jesus has demonstrated
that He wants to be my companion (literally, to share “bread with”), I must
respond at least as much as Zacchaeus, and maybe as much as Eleazar, or the
youthful victims of gun-toting killers.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>must be a witness – a martyr – for my relationship with the
Lord Jesus.  I must be willing to die, if necessary, to show where I stand.  I
must profess my faith in the Lord Jesus as much as the psalmist did in today’s
Responsorial when he said:  “You, O LORD, are my shield; my glory, You lift up
my head!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How have I been
called to be a witness (martyros) in the past? Have I been willing to publicly
give testimony to my faith or have I tried to bluff my way? What can I do to
stand up more for my faith? To whom can I give witness of my faith?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all who place their trust in
You.  Through Your GOoDness and the ministry of Your Son, You allow us to not
only have a glimpse of Your might and power, but also You invite us to come and
feast with You and share “bread with” You.  In return You ask us to renounce
our sinful past, make restitution (if necessary), and to publicly profess our
relationship with You.  Thank You for those who have gone before us as
witnesses and martyrs and have made You known to us by their commitment and
example.  By the continued power of Your Holy Spirit in our lives, strengthen
us and give us the courage to assert our faith.  To You we lift up this prayer
of praise and thanks as we invoke the name of Your Son, Jesus.  He is our
Savior and Lord, our Brother and Guide on our journey to You, and He has died,
is risen, and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and
only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  2 Maccabees 7: 1, 20-31;        Psalm 17: 1bcd,
5-6, 8b and 15;          Luke 19: 11-28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we are reminded that we will have to answer for the
gifts and talents that GOD has given us.  The First Reading relates the account
of the seven sons of a Hebrew woman who sees all seven of her sons being
executed on the same day.  She urges them to be faithful to the gifts of life
and of faith that GOD has given them, and she promises that they will
experience GOD’s life in a new and better way.  The Responsorial Psalm is
prayer asking GOD to judge the psalmist justly and give him a share in the
divine presence.  Jesus, in the Gospel, tells a combined parable that speaks
both of our need to use well the gifts that GOD has given us, and of the fact
that GOD will handle those who oppose the divine rule in their lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the Hellenic persecution of Jews in the second
century before the birth of Jesus, many faithful Jews met their deaths because
they refused to defile themselves by eating pork as they were commanded to do
by the occupying Greek forces.  Today’s account of one family of seven brothers
and their mother gives us an insight into the lives of the resolute believers
of that period in time.  What strikes me in both the verses that are in today’s
reading and the rest of the verses in this seventh chapter of the Second Book
of Maccabees is the mother.  Although she loves her sons very much, she
realizes that GOD is more important than her wishes for a comfortable life for her
sons.  She urges each of them to remember that she carried them in her womb for
nine months, but it was GOD Who gave them life and will continue to give life
to them.  Her pleas to her sons, especially the youngest (who is center of the
pericope that is read today), are moving and powerful.  The chapter ends
(although we don’t have it as part of the reading) with the mother’s own death
after seeing all of her sons executed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist today prays to GOD, trusting that GOD will be a
just judge when it comes to his own judgment.  The confidence that he expresses
in the psalm is reassuring.  Just being in the presence of the LORD is
comforting to the writer of this psalm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His journey</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to Jerusalem.  Since many faithful Jews believed that the
Messiah would establish a new nation starting in Jerusalem, they were expecting
Jesus to begin the process when he arrived in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy City.  Jesus shares two parables, intertwined with each
other, in today’s reading. In both parables the ruler departs from his
country.  One of the parables focuses on the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reaction of the citizens of the nation who do not want to
allow the ruler to continue his reign and, therefore, they plot against him. 
The other parable centers on the responsibility that the ruler gives to his
servants, expecting some sort of return on what he has given them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the ruler is absent, the wicked citizens continue to
make their plans against the ruler.  The servants, meanwhile, work to multiply
the money that the ruler entrusted to them.  When the ruler returns, he first
calls in the servants and sees </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what each has done with the wealth with which they were
entrusted.  One servant has earned tenfold, another fivefold, while a third has
hidden the gold coin so that he could at least return what was given to him. 
The ruler is pleased with the first two servants and sets them in places of
authority over cities.  The third servant is reprimanded for not at least
earning interest on the money.  The last part of the story has the ruler
commanding that the rebellious citizens be put to death for their traitorous
behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although some people might focus on the violence in the
First Reading and the Gospel, the issue that caught my attention is the
responsibility each of us has to respond to the gifts that GOD has given us,
especially the gifts of life and faith – symbolic of our relationship with the
GOD.  GOD expects us to not only treasure the gifts of life and faith, but also
to use those gifts in a way that gives praise to GOD by giving witness to the
value of life and faith.  Yes, it may mean we have to be witnesses to the point
of martyrdom, just as the seven sons and their mother.  It may also mean that
we will have to spread the faith by drawing even more people into a relationship
with GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we can use the gifts that GOD has given us to enrich the
life and faith not only of ourselves but also of others, then we will be able
to stand before the presence of the just and loving GOD and repeat the refrain
of today’s Responsorial:  “LORD, when Your glory appears, my joy will be full.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How have I used what
GOD has given me for the spread of the GOD’s Reign? Have I fearfully hidden the
blessings that GOD has given me or have I risked losing them in order to
multiple the blessings for the sake of GOD and the blessings of other people?
What can I do to make others aware of GOD as the giver of all GOoD things,
including life and faith?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all gifts.  Through Your GOoDness
You dispense Your blessings upon people.  Some individuals fear You and hide
their gifts rather than risking the loss of the gifts, but in so doing, they
actually fail to live in way that You intend.  There are also those who work in
opposition to what You desire.  Others are willing to step out in faith in
order to spread the gifts and thus become enriched by sharing what You have
bestowed upon them.  For the times we have failed to appreciate and use the
gifts, especially life and faith, we seek Your understanding and merciful
judgment, and pardon.  Continue to inspire us by the example of those who have
been witnesses (martyrs) to You and Your gifts, especially Your Son Who gave
His life for us.  We lift up this prayer of praise, glory, and thanks to You in
the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who has died, is risen,
and now is living and reigning with You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and only
GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

Readings:  1 Maccabees 2: 15-29;        Psalm 50: 1b-2, 5-6, 14-15;          
Luke 19: 41-44</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind us that being aware of GOD’s will is not
always easy.  It can become very emotional and also very divisive.  The First
Reading describes the difficult choices Mattathias and his family and friends
make in being faithful to GOD rather than giving into the enticements and
demands of the Greek oppressors.  The Responsorial Psalm gives hope to those
who are faithful to GOD.  They will experience being rescued by GOD. In the
Gospel, Jesus makes His final approach to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jerusalem and laments over the destruction that will fall
upon the City and the people, partly because they failed to heed His message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mattathias, a noble man of the town of Modein (a small town
to the northwest of Jerusalem), defies the order of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Greek occupation forces.  A decree had been proclaimed
demanding all people under the Hellenic rule to forsake their native religion
and worship the king. Mattathias is filled with a holy rage and not only kills
a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jew who starts to follow the royal command, but also slays
the Greek official who is enforcing the decree.  He destroys the altar set up
by the Greeks to be used in the worship of the king.  Mattathias then invites
the faithful Jews to join him in a rebellion by first leaving everything behind
and escaping to the south to the barren hill country. He realizes that he is
now an outlaw according to the Greeks, but he is living in the law of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial Psalm is a promise by GOD to take care of
those who remain faithful to GOD by offering sacrifice only to GOD.  If people
worship the LORD GOD alone, GOD will rescue them from whatever forces rally
against them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus comes over the hill to the east of
Jerusalem and starts to descend into the Kidron Valley.  As He comes over the
rise on which the town of Bethany is built, He can see the beautiful Temple and
the walled city of Jerusalem across the Kidron Valley.  He laments the destruction
that will take place in about</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40 years.  The Temple dedicated to the worship of His
Abba-Father will be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>destroyed and the Jewish people banned from the area.  The
ban will be in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>place for nearly the next 1900 years.  Jesus is saddened
when He reflects how things might have been different if only the whole of the
Jewish nation had recognized Him for Who He is – the Messiah, the Anointed One
of GOD, GOD’s own Son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever I hear this Gospel passage, I recall the time I
stood on the hill near Bethany and looked across the Kidron Valley.  It is an
awesome sight to see Jerusalem and the walls of the former Temple grounds and
the walls </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>surrounding the Old City.  There is a church built on one
spot of the hill from which one can view Jerusalem.  The church is called
Dominus Flevit – “the Lord Wept.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am saddened by the failure
to recognize Jesus, not just by the religious people of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ time, but also by others through all times since
then.  I can only begin to comprehend how terribly touching it must have been
for Jesus to ponder the sad fact of people’s conscious or unconscious choice
not to accept Him and what He was bringing to them – salus (healing, wholeness
and holiness, salvation).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of the song from the musical Jesus Christ
Superstar in which Jesus, almost in despair, prays to His Abba-Father because
it seems that His mission was heading to an apparent tragic end.  All that He
had done to bring GOoD News to the people, and how few totally followed Him. 
In the days ahead of Him, Jesus would see the excited crowds of Palm Sunday
turn into the rowdy mob of individuals who call for His death.  One of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His chosen twelve would hand Him over to His enemies.  His
appointed leader would deny Him three times.  All</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would flee as He would hang on the cross except for a few
women and the youngest of His disciples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder further, I realize that in my life I have, at
times, been no better than the mob who cried for His death, or the disciples
who deserted Him.  I have failed to fully accept Jesus and His message.  It has
been too hard or too challenging.  I then recall that Jesus has not given up on
me.  He continues to offer me yet another chance (and another. . .) to repent
and accept Him and His message.  He invites me to be His faithful witness
(martyr) and to stand up for my relationship with GOD, just as Mattathias and
his family did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is so different about the GOD in whom we believe in is
that our GOD loves and cares and emotes over us.  I still believe there are
times when Dominus flet – “the Lord weeps.”  Hopefully, sometimes it is not
just the crying tears of disappointment, but also tears of joy as more and more
people turn to the Lord Jesus and accept what GOD offers – salus.  Maybe then
the words of today’s psalm will express the joy GOD has as people turn to the
Lord Jesus:  “GOD the LORD has spoken and summoned the earth. . .GOD shines
forth.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What comes to mind
when I hear that “the Lord weeps”?  What does this tell me about Who Jesus is? 
Have I had the courage to stand up and defend my faith as Mattathias and his
family did?  In what ways can I be a better witness to the faith?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all emotions. Through Your
GOoDness, You have shared Your essence with us, which includes the ability to
express our feelings and make decisions with zeal. Your Son, Jesus,
demonstrated His love and concern for people as He reflected on Your Holy City
of Jerusalem and how the people of all ages have missed in their understanding
Your great passion and compassion for us. For the times we have failed to be
moved by Your care for us, we seek Your pardon.  Following the example of Your
Son, Jesus, helps us be aware of our feelings and make decision that are based
not just on our emotions, but also on a fuller understanding of Your plan for
our lives and the lives of the people around us.  Continue to inspire us with
the ever-present gift of Your Holy Spirit.  We make this prayer of praise and
thanks to You, in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Brother and Savior, Who
continues to cry both tears of sorrow and of joy as people reject or accept
Your GOoDness, and what He has done when He died, rose, and now as He is living
and reigning with You and Your Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Maccabees 4: 36-37, 52-59;     1 Chronicles 29:
10bcd, 11abc, 11d-12a, 12bcd;     Luke 19: 45-48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Central to today’s readings is the Jerusalem Temple.  In the
First Reading we hear about the Dedication of the Temple, once Judas Maccabees
and his companions had ousted the Greeks from the Temple.  The Responsorial
Psalm is a hymn of praise to the GOD Who is mighty and glorious.  The Gospel is
the Lucan account of Jesus’ cleansing the Temple that had become a marketplace
instead of the House of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Temple in Jerusalem had been desecrated when the Greek
authorities took control of Jerusalem.  The occupying forces had taken the
valuable and valued furnishings of Temple and replaced them with pagan images. 
When Judas and those who were faithful to the ways of their Hebrew ancestors
regained control of Jerusalem, they removed and destroyed all the pagan images
and re-furnished the Temple.  The date of the this was the twenty- fifth day of
the Hebrew month of Chislev (December 14, 164 B.C[.E]).  On the anniversary of
the desecration, they celebrated the Dedication of the Temple with an eight-day
festival of lights, that has come down to our current age as the celebration of
Hanukkah.  Hanukkah this year begins on the evening of Thursday, December 7,
2023.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial today is a prayer of praise of GOD.  It
gives glory and honor as it blesses the name of the LORD for all that GOD has
done and continues to do.  It recognizes the awesomeness of the Almighty and
express thanks for the grandeur of GOD touching human life and making the
divine presence known.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today, Jesus has arrived in Jerusalem.  He
enters the Temple, the dwelling place in which His Abba-Father, GOD, has chosen
to make the divine presence known in special way.  The outer courts of the
Temple were cluttered with money changers, sellers of the animals of sacrifice,
and other people buying and selling items. Jesus becomes irate with the
commercialization in the Temple.  As He</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>drives out the merchants, the religious leaders (who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>probably received a certain amount of financial gain from
the “businesses”) use Jesus’ cleansing of the Temple as just another issue for
which they want to silence Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am reminded of the
specialness and holiness of the House of GOD. Following the long-established
pattern of the Jewish ancestors (including Judas Maccabees), Jesus desires that
the House of GOD be a place where people can come into a greater awareness of
the awesomeness of the GOD Who has interacted with humans to manifest divine
love for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of one of my experiences in the Holy Land.  I
was at the Catholic Church of the Annunciation in Nazareth (taking a break from
my studies in the Holy </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Land).  I went into the church to spend time reflecting upon
the Angel Gabriel’s appearance to Mary, asking her to be the mother of the
Savior and the fact of the Incarnation of GOD in the person of Jesus.  As I was
in prayer, a Moslem “tour guide” (fingering his Moslem prayer beads), told me I
had to pay him for the tour.  I tried to explain to him that I was only in the
church to pray, not to go on the tour.  He kept insisting on being paid as my
tour guide.  I finally just stood up, and left the church and went to another
smaller (Eastern Orthodox) church where I could pray and not be bothered by the
self-imposition of “my tour guide.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is important is that we set aside a “holy place” where
we can be conscious of being in the presence of our GOD.  This “holy place”
does not necessarily have to be a “church.”  (I am not putting down going to a
church, especially one where the Blessed Sacrament is.  It is great to go to
church, if we can, to be in presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.)  This
“holy place” does not have to be a specific geographical or structural
location.  It is the time and attitude that makes it a “holy place” because it
is there where we are aware that we are with the Holy GOD, and GOD is with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet so often we desecrate the dwelling place of GOD,
especially within ourselves.  We put up false idols to which we bow:  fame,
fortune, feelings, and fun.  We turn our “holy place” into a marketplace and
clutter it with commercial products.  We forget that we are Temples of the
living GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today gives us an opportunity to cleanse the Temple – the
Holy Place – where we are in touch with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father and
the Holy Spirit.  It allows us to once again focus on the presence of GOD.  We
need to realize that everyplace and everyone is called to be the dwelling place
of the LORD GOD, for everything and anyone belongs to GOD.  If we are more
conscious of GOD’s ownership of all, and the divine presence in all, we can
join the psalmist today and say:  “Yours, O LORD, are grandeur and power,
majesty, splendor, and glory. For all in heaven and on earth is Yours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think of the
“Dwelling Place of GOD,” what comes to mind? Do I sense that I am the Temple in
which GOD dwells? How much time do I spend praying and being conscious of my
being in GOD’s presence?  What changes in my life flow from the awareness of my
being the dwelling place of GOD and my call to bring GOD’s presence to others
and the realization that they, too, are the place in which GOD dwells?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all places and people. 
Through Your GOoDness You have made Your presence known.  In ages past, people
erected buildings in which they could sense Your presence.  When Your Son came
to earth and was born in human flesh, He reminded us that You wish to dwell
among us, not just in a building, but in each and every person.  For the times
we have forgotten that we are Your Temples, the dwelling places in which You
reside, we seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  With the continued outpouring of
Your Holy Spirit, helps us to cleanse all that is unholy within us and make
ourselves Holy Places in which You can</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>manifest Your presence, not just for our own sakes, but also
for the GOoD of others.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus,
the Divine One in human flesh, Who manifests You in His ministry, life, death
and resurrection, and Who is living and reigning in Your heavenly Temple, with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-cecilia</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  1 Maccabees 6: 1-13;         Psalm 9: 2-3, 4 and
6, 16 and 19;       Luke 20: 27-40</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“GOD. . .is GOD of the living.”  This phrase of Jesus from
the Gospel seems central to the readings today. The First Reading is Greek King
Antiochus’ realization that death is imminent for him and he does not face it
with joyful anticipation because of what he had done to the Chosen People of
GOD, the Jews.  The psalm refrain is:  “I will rejoice in Your salvation, LORD”
and it describes the hope of those who believe and trust in the GOD of the
living.  In the Gospel, Jesus uses the question by the Sadducees to reinforce
the teaching on the resurrection of the dead and GOD being the GOD of the
living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Near the end of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes (d. circa
165</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>B.C.), he reviews his reign.  Of particular concern to him
is the mistreatment he had imposed upon the Jews.  He had been responsible for
the destruction of the Temple, the tearing down of the walls surrounding
Jerusalem, and the forcing of the Jews to worship him. According to the reading
today, the Greek king is hopelessly faced with death as he ponders his
wrongdoings against GOD’s holy people.  The rest of the books of Maccabees has
emphasized the belief of some of the Jews in the resurrection of the dead. 
This passage reflects the fear of death that is experienced by the people who
have opposed GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist praises the GOD Who brings salvation to the
people.  Of particular</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>interest is the fact that GOD turns back the enemies of the
just and destroys the forces who have inflicted harm and pain upon the Chosen
People.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is confronted by the religious group known
as the Sadducees. In contrast to the Pharisees, the Sadducees did not believe
in an afterlife.  [One way to remember which Jewish group did not believe in
the resurrection of the dead is by the phrase “it is  sad, you see (Sadducee),
that they had no hope in life after death.”]  Hoping to trap Jesus, the
Sadducees pose a question to Him.  They ask about the Mosaic prescription that
the brothers of a dead man had to marry the widow in order to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>provide offspring for the dead man (Levirate Law - Deuteronomy
25: 5-10).  They want Jesus to say to which</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>husband will the widow be married if all seven brothers had
died without the woman bearing a child.  Jesus turns the question into a
discussion about GOD rather than about what life is like in the hereafter.  GOD
is the giver and sustainer of life, both on this side of death and on the other
side.  GOD is the GOD of the living.  Therefore, those who are with GOD have
life, even as they finish their earthly existence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two things strike me in today’s readings:  1) Jesus’ ability
to use the supposed entrapping questions of His enemies as occasions to teach
the Truth; and 2) the inability of Jesus’ listeners (include people today) to
fully comprehend the GOD of the living and what the afterlife is all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even after hearing scripture passages again and again over
the years, I am still touched by the wisdom of Jesus in answering those who
present questions to Him, particularly questions meant to trap Him into saying
something that they could use against Him. Jesus makes every situation and
every response a time </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of preaching the GOoD News and instructing those who are
open to the Truth.  Jesus is able to see through the pretenses of His enemies
and proclaim the message of salvation no matter what.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Jesus gives witness to the Truth, He is misunderstood,
not because of what He says is confusing, but because those who hear His words
refuse to really be attentive to what He is saying.  Jesus wants people to not
only hear and understand what He proclaims, but He desires that they accept it,
and let it change their lives for the GOoD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The emphasis of the Truth today is that GOD is the GOD of
the living.  Yet how often people, including myself, fail to make that Truth
effective in the day-to-day living out of the Gospel.  If we would realize that
GOD is not only eternal in the very essence of Who GOD is, but that GOD wants
to share eternal life with us, we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would have to act in ways that proclaim life.  GOD is the
giver of life – all life.  GOD decides when life should begin, and when earthly
life should transition to eternal life.  It is not up to us to decide whether
there should or should not be life.  We must embrace life that GOD gives us. 
We must foster the sanctity of life.  We should do all we can so that people
experience not only the joys of earthly life, but also the blessedness of
eternal life to the fullest extent possible.  We have to preach that GOD is GOD
of the living – both now and in the hereafter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One way we can be proclaimers of the living GOD is by
publicly praising the GOD of the living.  We should live in a way that gives
glory to GOD, not only now, but also forever.  We can also rejoice in GOD for
giving and sustaining life.  Our whole lives should echo the words of the
psalmist today:  “I will give thanks to You, O</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD, with all my heart; I will declare all Your wondrous
deeds.  I will be glad and exult in You; I will sing praise to Your name, Most
High.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What thoughts come
to my mind when I think about GOD being the GOD of the living?  What is the
full meaning of life for me, both life here and now, and in the hereafter? 
Does my life proclaim that GOD is the GOD of the living, Who is responsible for
the beginning of earthly life and the end of that life?  What can I do to
support GOD-given life from conception to natural death?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all life and all who are
living here on earth and in the hereafter.  Through Your GOoDness You bestow
life from its first moment of existence through the ending of the earthly
journey, to the eternal life that awaits on the other side of physical death. 
Not only have You breathed Your Spirit into hunks of clay in order to give life
to the sojourners on earth, but You have made it possible for all who accept
Your message to experience eternal life – Your life – in heaven.  At the
perfect time in the life of the world, You sent Your Son, Jesus, to share our
human life for the very purpose of making it possible for us to share in Your
divine life.  His whole existence, life, ministry, death, and resurrection
pointed to the reality of You being the GOD of the living.  Yet, because of our
limited comprehension and our failure to accept His message in its entirety, we
have sometimes limited Your life-giving graces flowing through us.  Extend Your
forgiveness and promise of life to us yet again.  By the gifts that flow from
Your Holy Spirit, may we be bold witnesses to You as the GOD of the living.  We
lift up this prayer of praise, glory, and thanks to You, GOD of the living, in
and through Your Son, Jesus, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, Who has died and
rose that we might have eternal life, and Who is now living and reigning with
You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD of the living, now and forever. 
Amen.</p>

Colossians 1: 12-20;     Luke 23: 35-43</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings focus on the concept of kingship,
particularly the Kingship of Christ Jesus. The First Reading declares the joy
of the Israelites as they come to David, and they crown and anointed him their
king. The Responsorial Psalm likewise proclaims the joy of those who are on the
way to the city of King David.  St. Paul, in his letter to the Colossians,
exults and exalts Jesus as co-creator, redeemer, and royal ruler of the Reign
of GOD, His Abba-Father. The Gospel informs us that Jesus is crucified because
He claims that He is the King. Although most people ridicule His kingship,
Jesus promises</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a place in His heavenly reign to the repentant criminal who
is crucified with Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reviewing a little of the background of today’s First
Readings helps us to put things in context. The Israelites had petitioned GOD
for a king and Saul was anointed as their first king. The prophet Samuel had
warned the people about having a king. Saul turned out to be a poor choice as
king. GOD then chooses a shepherd to be the next king of Israel. David begins
his reign by defending the people from their enemies and setting up a kingdom
that is only surpassed by his son, Solomon. Yet, David, showing his human
weaknesses, sins against GOD and within a couple of generations, the kingdom of
Israel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is split apart. He and the rest of the kings of Israel and
Judah forget that they are only temporary signs of GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reigning over the Chosen People. It is only GOD Who is truly
King.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the Chosen People, a pilgrimage to the Temple of GOD in
the royal city of King David is an exciting event. Jerusalem is seen as the
place to be, because it is here that the Davidic line rules and here GOD’s
presence is felt. There seems to be a link between the king and GOD. So, to go
to Jerusalem is a double blessing – not only to be in GOD’s presence, but to be
with the ruler who represents GOD’s choosing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his letter to the people of Colossae, St. Paul reminds
the believers that GOD is the ultimate ruler. It is the divine plan that Jesus,
the Son of GOD, be handed the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>rule of GOD’s reign because Jesus as the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD-man brought about the salvation of the world. Not only
has the Son of GOD been co-creator of the universe, but it was also for Him and
through Him all things have come to be. Yet even earthly creation is not the
summit of the Jesus’ work. He has come to lead His Body (the Church) into the
everlasting reign where there will be unending and undimmed light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel reminds us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that Jesus’ kingship has come at a great cost. Although the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospel tells us that people misunderstand His claim to be
King, Jesus demonstrates His right to rule the Kingdom through His life, death,
and resurrection. His persecutors try to mock His assertion of His kingship by
posting His crime on top of the cross: “King of the Jews.” He is reviled by His
executioners and by one of the individuals who is crucified with Him. Yet, it
is the other condemned criminal who professes his faith in Jesus’ kingship as
he asks to be remembered when Jesus comes into His kingdom through His death.
Jesus reassures the individual, “this day you will be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with Me in Paradise.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People have often misunderstood the role of kings. The
Israelites believed that having a king would make them equal to, or even better
than, their neighbors who had kings. Yet, as often happens with many people in
authority, the kings of Israel and Judah let power and honor go to their heads
and they failed to rule the people as GOD would have them do. Yet true to GOD’s
promise that a descendant of David would come as the true king of GOD’s Chosen
People, One finally comes Who rules as GOD wills and Who ushers in the Reign of
GOD through His service of GOD’s people, including all people. Even when Jesus
comes as the fulfillment of GOD’s promises, most of His contemporaries,
including many of His disciples (at least originally), expect Him to be the
majestic individual Who will overturn the Roman occupation and restore the
Chosen People to their rightful self-rule. Jesus demonstrates through His life,
ministry, death, and resurrection, that reigning in the Reign of GOD means
doing His Abba’s will and serving others so that they will realize how much GOD
wants them to be part of the everlasting Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we end this liturgical year, I am reminded that the
fulness of the Reign of GOD is not here on this earth. Yet, at the same time, I
must begin to live as a member of that Reign right now. I must work for the
spread of the Reign of GOD and live my life as a witness to what is yet to be
when GOD recreates the new heaven and the new earth and Jesus reigns supreme
with His Abba for ever and ever. I must be an active participant in the
bringing about GOD’s rule of peace, justice, light, and joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the ways that I can be proactive in celebrating the
Reign of GOD is by imitating Jesus in His service of others. On the night
before He died, after washing His disciples’ feet, He proclaimed, “You call me
Lord and Master, and that is truly what I am, but if I, your Lord and Master,
have washed your feet, so must you do for one another” (John 13: 13-14). Thus,
I am called to treat people with respect, serving them, and helping lead them
to the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus. I, like my Master, must be willing to die for
them, so that they may be welcomed by the Lord Jesus and His Abba into the
eternal Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, I have been invited to be a child of the King, and part
of the heavenly Reign, but that does not make me better than other people. It
is none of my doing that I am part of the royal family. I am inheriting
something that I have not, and cannot, earn. As I sign of my acceptance of such
a gift, I am being asked to bring others into the Reign of my GOD and King.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way I can do that is by living a life that is marked
by peace, joy, and a sense of the eternal light that will mark the heavenly
Reign. People should be able to experience a small taste of what lies ahead by
the way I treat them. I must be as joyful as the pilgrims who enthusiastically
headed to the city of the King; in fact, I must be even more joy filled as I
journey toward the eternal Reign of my Lord Jesus and His Abba in union with
the Holy Spirit.  Thus, I should live a life that proclaims in action the words
of the psalmist today, “Let us go rejoicing to the House of the Lord.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I hear that
Jesus is Christ the King, what thoughts do I have? How can I profess my faith
that Jesus is King and Lord of my life? Can other people recognize that I claim
Jesus as my Lord and King? What can I do to hasten the coming of the Reign of
GOD in the lives of myself and others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, creator and ruler of heaven and
earth. Through Your GOoDness, You invite us to be a part of Your Reign by first
giving us birth and then offering to us the gift of being Your sons and
daughters. In order for us to fully understand Your desire that we share in
Your eternal Reign, You have sent Your Son, Jesus, to share in our humanity and
to lift us up to sharing in the divine life. Yet, sometimes we have become too
attached to our concept of living as rulers of this world that we have failed
to keep our eyes focused on the royal mansion prepared for us by Jesus, our
Redeemer and King. With the continued guidance of Your Holy Spirit, helps to proclaim
the Kingship of Jesus by our actions and our words. We joyfully look forward to
being with You, and Your Son, for ever. We lift up a prayer of praise and
thanks to You, and to Jesus, our King and Savior, Who has come to serve us and
saves us by His life, ministry, death, and resurrection and Who is now fully
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 1: 1-6, 8-20;             Daniel 3: 52,
53, 54, 55, 56;                    Luke 21: 1-4</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Things are not always as the appear.  In the First Reading,
we hear about Daniel and his three Jewish companions who have been placed in
positions of service to the king of Babylon.  By their own choice, they subsist
on a meager diet of water and vegetables and end up healthier than the other
servants of the king who eat much more and drink wine.  The Responsorial is
part of the hymn sung by three of the Jewish youth as they encounter the
hell-fire punishment of the king whom they were to serve.  In the Gospel, Jesus
relates the account of the widow who donates to GOD her whole fortune – two
small coins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the nation of Judah fell to the invading
Chaldeans/Babylonians (circa 597 BC), the conquering king demanded the service
of the best youth of the conquered people. Into this service were four young
Jewish men:  Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (who were given Babylonian
names: Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the non- proclaimed
verse 7 of chapter 1 of Daniel).  In order to keep themselves free from defiled
foods, they requested to eat only uncooked vegetables and drink water.  (Any
cooked food was mostly likely cooked over fires that came from wood from the
Babylonian sacred trees which would make the food “tainted” by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sacrilegious practices for the Jews.)  Daniel pleaded with
the official who was in charge of the training of all the youth from conquered
peoples, asking that he and the other three Jewish young men be tested for ten
days to see if they could maintain healthy appearances under their limited, but
religiously “kosher” diet.  After the ten days, the four young Jews were
healthier and more physically fit than the other men in training for the king’s
service, so they remained on their kosher diet of vegetables and water.  This
diet is often called the “Daniel Diet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is taken from a later chapter in the Book
of Daniel and is part of a hymn sung by the same Jewish young men as they are
being tested by fire. Even in the midst of their torture and intended
executions, their first thoughts are to praise GOD.  Again, we see that things
are not always as they appear.  According to chapter three of Daniel, Hananiah
(Shadrach), Mishael (Mechach) and Azariah (Abednego) refuse to worship the
golden statue of the king of Babylon.  The punishment for this direct violation
of the law is the death sentence</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>– being burned alive.  Because these three had been special
servants of the king, their punishment is made more intense by heating the
fires of the white-hot furnace “seven” times more than usual.  The three are
bound and thrown into the furnace. The furnace is so hot that the executioners
who throw the young men into the flames are consumed by the fire, yet after a
short while the faithful three are seen walking unfettered amidst the fiery
flames, singing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the praise of GOD that are part of today’s </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Responsorial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, while Jesus is in the Temple in Jerusalem, He
watches people giving their donations.  Some wealthy individuals obviously
attracted great attention as they make their contributions – excesses from
their great fortunes. Jesus also notices a poor widow who drops a couple copper
coins (not worthy much objectively).  Jesus points out that she gave more than
the rest, because she </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gave all that she had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today made me realize that GOD sees into the
hearts and minds of people and GOD does not judge by humanly objective
standards.  What seems apparent to human eyes, is not necessarily so.  The
widow only gives a donation worth a couple of cents, but in reality she gives
much more, for she gives everything she has.  The four young youth in today’s
First Reading eat only a meager amount of food, and yet they are healthier than
those who feast on royal food and wine.  The fire that is meant to burn and
kill the three Jewish men, becomes a place of worship of the one true GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of one of my favorite scripture passages,
Romans 8: 28:  “All things work for the GOoD of those who are called by GOD.” 
To me, what seems like tragedy or at least not the best, can turn out for GOoD
for those who trust in GOD.  It may not be immediately apparent how a seemingly
negative experience can be considered to be GOoD, but with faith and time, we
can see the hand of GOD at work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago, I was reminded of this when a young lady
experienced an emotional and psychological blow. Her whole athletic focus for a
long time has been on basketball.  She had gone through summer basketball camps
and summer and fall leagues, training, and practices, all with the desire to be
on the varsity basketball team her senior year in high school.  One evening
during her senior year, she received a call from the coach telling her she did
not make the “cut” and was not on the team.  It was devastating to her.  As her
mother and father tried to console her and comfort her, I thought of the passage
from Romans 8: 28.  Her mother kept trying to reassure her that there must be
some reason that was not apparent for what happened, and she promised her that
something GOoD would come of this tragic event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are waiting to hear what GOoD flowed from this event,
I cannot yet tell you, for it has not become apparent – at least not fully. 
The young lady did not give up her love for basketball.  She ended up being a
student manager of the USC Women’s Basketball team.  Her first sports love is
still basketball.  I do believe, however, that this apparent negative
experience will ultimately result in even more GOoD.  It may not be revealed to
this young lady or to me or to anyone else for many years, but I am firmly
convinced that GOD is in control and sees what we don’t see and will make it
work out for GOoD, her GOoD, and the GOoD of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The response we must make, even in the midst of the most
hell-like experiences we encounter, is to give glory and praise to GOD, just as
the three young men in the fiery furnace in today’s Responsorial.  We must join
them by saying:  “Blessed are You, O Lord, the GOD of our ancestors,
praiseworthy and exalted above all forever;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And blessed is Your holy and glorious name, praiseworthy and
exalted above all for all ages.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often have I
encountered situation(s) which apparently seemed one way, but in hindsight and
a GOoD perspective, turned out the opposite?  What did I learn from such
occasion(s)?  Have I been able to praise GOD from the midst of such a
fire-tested circumstance(s)?   How can I bolster other people as they go
through a hell-like time in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all time and experiences. 
Through Your GOoDness You make all things work out for the GOoD of those whom
You call and who respond to Your gift of faith.  You are able to make GOoD come
of what seems to human eyes to be the worst of tragedies.  You see deep within
us, into our minds and souls, and know our orientation and desires.  For the
times we have not trusted You and Your love for us, we ask Your pardon and
forgiveness.  You have sent Your Son as Your very best gift to us.  He taught
us about Your love and demonstrated Your concern for all people, but especially
for those who were outcasts and suffering.  In the most apparent contradiction
of all, He suffered and died so that we might be healed and live. Continue to
touch our lives with the strength, courage, hope, and wisdom that flow from
Your Holy Spirit, so that we can persevere in the most difficult situations in
our lives.  And may we always lift up a hymn of praise and glory to You, even
in the midst of most hell-like situations.  We make this prayer in the name of
Your Son,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who has died and is
risen, and Who is now living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one
and only GOD, GOD of the living, now and forever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 2: 31-45;        Daniel 3: 57, 58, 59, 60,
61;          Luke 21: 5-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this last week of the liturgical (and ecclesiastical)
year, we continue to focus on apocalyptic readings that speak of things to
come, and also what was happening currently at the time of the reading, and
also now.  The First Reading describes Daniel’s interpretation of King
Nebuchadnessar’s dream.  The Responsorial is also taken from Daniel and is the
part of the hymn sung by the youths in the fiery furnace.   In the Gospel,
Jesus forecasts some of the signs of the days ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daniel, one of the four Jewish youth in the service of the
King of Babylon, has been given the gift of the interpretation of dreams.  The
king’s dream is a vision of a statue composed of various materials.  Daniel
“sees” that each of the different materials is descriptive of a kingdom that
will come.  The golden head is the kingdom of the Babylonians, the silver torso
is the next kingdom, that of the Medians.  The bronze belly and thigh represent
the Persian dynasty; while the legs of iron refer to the Greeks. Finally, the
feet of iron and clay relate to the division of the Greek empire after the
death of Alexander the Great when his empire was split.  Only two (of the
three) historical division of the Greek empire are mentioned because those two
(the Ptolemy dynasty in Egypt, and the Seleucid dynasty in Syria) directly
related to the Jewish nation.  Finally, a mighty hewn rock rolls down from the
mountain (place of higher importance) and destroys the statue.  This signifies that
the GOD will establish a new kingdom that will surpass the others and will last
forever.  This is the reign of the Messiah (“the Anointed One” or “Christ”) of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is part of the hymn of praise to GOD.  It
invokes all of creation to be part of praising GOD. Everything that GOD has
made should bless the LORD of all.  The key verbs that repeat themselves over
and over are “bless,” “praise,” and “exalt.”  These all refer to acknowledging
GOD for Who GOD is:  the Almighty Creator, the Supreme Being, and the Exalted
One.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel passage from Luke, Jesus’ description of
the signs of the end times differs from Jesus’ words in Mark’s Gospel (chapter
13). This may reflect the experiences of the community to whom Luke addresses
his Gospel.  Mark wrote his Gospel prior to Luke and was influenced by the
concept of imminent eschatology – that is, the end of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the world was just around the corner.  By the time Luke sat
down to record the life and teachings of Jesus, Luke and the Christian community
in which he wrote realized that the end of the ages may not be as immediate as
the very first believers had expected.  Yes, there will be an</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>end time and believers must be prepared, but the faith
community should not become overly worried by those who announced the impending
end of the world.  There are some people who are saying that the wars in the
Middle East and Eastern Europe are signs of the end times.  The most important
message for all people is that they must be prepared to meet the Lord Jesus,
whether that be at the moment of their death or when Jesus returns again at the
end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few things struck me as I reviewed the readings:  1) no
one knows when the end will come; 2) the experiences that we have, should make
us reflect on the Truth and apply it what is presently happening; 3) no matter
when I meet my end, I must be prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I firmly believe that some people, like Daniel, can be given
special gifts by GOD that enable them to interpret signs and visions of GOD. 
The true role of a prophet of GOD is not necessarily “seeing” the future, but
being able to proclaim the message that GOD wants announced.  The literal
meaning of the Greek for word “prophet” is “spokesperson” or “one who speaks
for another.”  Daniel’s message was given to inspire hope in the oppressed
people of GOD.  Daniel spoke GOD’s Word – that GOD would establish a time and
place where the Anointed One (“Messiah,” “Christ”) would usher in GOD’s reign. 
The actual details were not known by Daniel.  Daniel was not given the precise
vision of the birth of the GOD-man, Jesus.  The Book of Daniel was a means for
GOD to prepare the people of GOD for the further manifestation of GOD’s glory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The experiences of those who put their pen to paper in order
to write down the Word of GOD influenced what they wrote.  GOD used the life
happenings of the individual to reveal the Truth.  Some biblical scholars
believe that the Book of Daniel took a written form during the time of the
Greek invasion of the Holy Land two centuries before the birth of Jesus.  If
so, the final scribes would have known about the successive world powers: the
Babylonians, the Medians, the Persians, and the Greeks (with the Greeks having
a divided kingdom).  What is important is not how or what was known by the
scribes who put the words into writing, but that the Truth of GOD be
proclaimed:  GOD will establish an everlasting kingdom for those who were the
Chosen People. Similarly, the audience to whom Luke addressed his Gospel had
experienced the destruction of Jerusalem and knew of preachers who “announced”
the immediate end of the world, yet obvious to us, the world did not end during
the first century after the death of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That leads me to my third topic of reflection:  the need to
be ready.  That we all will meet our own end is a fact that cannot be denied. 
Mortal death is part of existence here on earth.  The Truth is that we must be
prepared not just for the end of time, but also for the fact of our own death. 
We must live lives that reflect that there is something after death – something
that is even better than what we can experience and envision now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question is how do we prepare? Or to put it into other
words, what should our lifestyle be if we want to reflect our belief that we
will meet the end of our earthly existence and transition into the fullness of
the Reign of GOD? I believe if we are conscious that we are GOD’s Chosen
People, inheritors of the Reign of GOD, sons and daughters of GOD, and sisters
and brothers of the Lord Jesus, then we are going to live in a way that
proclaims who we are and to Whom we are “related.”  Our lives should reflect to
Whose family we belong. People should be able to see us and say, “I know the
family of which you are member because you are just like your Brother (Jesus)
and His Abba-Father.  You act just like Your Brother.  I can see Your Abba in
you and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what you do.”  If we can live that way, then we will be
blessing, and praising, and exalting the Lord Jesus and the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba not just now, but forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When I think of “end
times” (whether my own personal end or the end of this world as we know it),
what thoughts come to mind?  Am I apprehensive?  Do I look forward to it with
joy?  Do I sense my calling to share in the prophetic role of the Lord Jesus by
being GOD’s spokesperson and proclaiming the Truth? Have my life experiences
enabled me to be a better spokesperson for the Truth of GOD? Can people see, by
my lifestyle, to Whose family I belong? Is it obvious to others what is my belief
in my final destination in the Reign of GOD? How can I help others know and
live out their call to be part of the Reign of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all Your creation.  Through
Your GOoDness You have invited us to be part of Your eternal reign and members
of Your family.  You have revealed Your Truth to those who experienced Your
presence in different ways in their lives.  You inspired Your prophets and
evangelists to speak Your Truth to others.  In the fullness of time, You sent
Your only Son to be the Truth incarnate.  We have sometimes failed to hear and
experience the Truth and have sought false prophets who have not proclaimed the
Truth.  We seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to fill us with the
gifts of Your Holy Spirit, especially the gifts of wisdom, understanding,
courage, and faithfulness so we can proclaim Your Truth in our lives.  May
people be able to see that we belong to You, by the way we act and live out the
life and faith You have given us.  We come to bless, praise, and exalt You as
we join together with Your Son, Jesus, for He is our Brother and Savior, our
Master-Teacher, and the Truth, and He is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 5: 1-6, 13-14, 16-17, 23-28;        Daniel
3: 62, 63, 64, 65, 66;           Luke 21: 12-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Continuing with the concept of impending doom, today’s
readings can be a bit scary.  The First Reading is the account of the divine
“writing on the wall” of the Babylonian palace.  [The phrase, “seeing the
writing on the wall,” is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>an allusion to the passage in the First Reading.]  The
Responsorial continues the hymn of praise of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus warns
His audience that the faithful disciples will experience suffering and
persecution, even from members of their own families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading today, King Belshazzar of Babylon
throws a royal banquet for the nobles and leaders.  He and his guests use
golden, and other precious metal, vessels taken from the Temple in Jerusalem at
the time of the destruction of Jerusalem and the beginning of the Exile.  While
the party- goers are feasting, a hand is seen writing three words on the wall of
the palace.  MENE, TEKEL, PERES.  Daniel, the Jewish dream and vision
interpreter, is called in to explain what it means.  Daniel uses the occasion
to predict the end of the Babylonian rule (under King Belshazzar and his absent
father, King Navbonidus) and the overthrow of his government by the Persians. 
Although the “writing on the wall” was a message of impending doom for the
Babylonian</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>king, it was a message of hope for GOD’s people as they saw
the end of the oppression with the fall of the Babylonian empire. [An
interesting novel of the period is  Return to Me by Lynn Austin.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Responsorial once again comes from the hymn of the
Jewish youth in the fiery furnace.  It is a call to all of creation to join in
the hymn of praise to GOD, the Creator.  GOD is to be exalted above all else
forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is aware of His own impending passion
and death.  He wants His listeners to realize that suffering may be part of
their allegiance to Him and to His Abba-Father. Not only can they expect to be persecuted,
but the persecution may come from members of their close acquaintances and
family.  According to Jesus, they will be hauled before authorities, face
trials, be deserted by family, even betrayed by loved ones. It seems that Jesus
is predicting what will happen to Him in the very near future.  He will be
seized and brought before religious tribunals and civil authorities.  He will
be handed </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>over by members of His closest friends.  He will be deserted
by His followers.  A key line in this passage is Jesus’ command not to spend
time preparing an elaborate defense, but to trust that He will provide the
correct words of testimony for His followers to speak as they face their
opponents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is not comfortable to think that we may have to suffer,
be persecuted, or even die for the name of Jesus. Yet, being His disciples
means we have to be willing to be witnesses (martyroi = “martyrs”).  Hopefully,
we will see the handwriting on the wall, and it won’t be as disastrous for us
as the message that was given to the King of Babylon.  Just as Jesus advises
His followers not to plan out what they are going to say, so we, too, must not
worry about how we might have to give witness to Jesus and our relationship
with Him.  We should take Jesus at His word and realize that not only will He
provide the words for us to speak, but He will also see us through any </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>difficulty we might face as we testify for and about Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At one of the Bible Studies I attend, we were discussing the
readings for the upcoming Sundays.  We talked about being a martyr.  We said in
some way those who had to give witness to their faith by dying had to do so
once, and it was over.  We, on the other hand, must constantly give witness to
our faith in a society that asks us to join it in worshiping the false gods of
fame, fortune, and fun.  We are called to boldly stand up for our relationship
to the Lord Jesus at all times.  It may be more subtle, but more difficult. 
Maybe our society needs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“writing on the wall” to shake it up.  Could it be that we are
being asked to write a different “writing on the wall” by not just challenging
our society by our GOoD example, but also by writing letters of affirmation to
people who need to be supported in their living out their faith (and letters of
challenge to those responsible for making decisions that do not reflect the
Truth of the Gospel).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just think how enriched and uplifted we could all be if we
spent some time, especially during Advent that starts this weekend, writing
letters of encouragement to others, and maybe including an edifying word in our
Christmas cards.  In those letters we could point out what GOoD points we see
in the person(s) to whom we write and mention the fact that we are praying for
the person(s) who is/are the recipient(s) of our message. Maybe that would use
the positive “writing on the note” that would make someone’s day and help them
get through some difficulties and hard times they were facing and give them the
courage to be witnesses to their faith. It could also allow us to join with all
of creation in echoing the Responsorial today by giving praise to GOD and
exalting the Lord Jesus above all forever, for whatever we do to another, we do
to the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What “writing on
the wall” have I seen and how have I taken the message from GOD? Am I scared by
the warning or am I bolstered in the Truth? How do I feel when I realize that
my life as a disciple of the Lord Jesus will include a certain amount of
suffering because of my allegiance to Him? What reassurance do I experience
when I hear that Jesus will give me the words to speak at the right time? How
can I be a better witness (martyros) for the Lord Jesus by the way I live my
life? What can I do to encourage others in the ways of faith by speaking to
them or writing to them?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all peoples.  Through Your
GOoDness You have written Your message for us to see.  For the times we have
failed to pay attention to our actions, the writing on the wall may seem
threatening, and reminds us that we must come before You with repentant
hearts.  In times of anxiety, especially as we give witness to our relationship
with You and Your Son, the writing on the wall can be very re-assuring.
Continue to pour out Your gifts from the Your Holy Spirit so we will have the
wisdom, the strength, and the faith to stand up for our commitment to You.  May
we use the written word (including emails and postings on social media) to
encourage and edify others so that they may realize Your concern and love for
them.  As always, we come as Your daughters and sons, brothers and sisters of
the Lord Jesus, and lift up this prayer of praise, glory, and exaltation to
You, in the name of the same Lord Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who has
died, is risen, and now is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Francesco Antonio Fasani:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-francesco-antonio-fasani</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 6: 12-28;       Daniel 3: 68, 69, 70, 71,
72, 73, 74;       Luke 21: 20-28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we close out this week and the liturgical year, we again
hear readings chosen to give us strength and encouragement to faithfully be
prepared for the end, whether our personal end comes first or the end of time
happens before our personal death.  The First Reading is the account of Daniel
in the lions’ den and how he has faith in GOD and is spared from being devoured
by the lions.  The Responsorial is a continuation of the hymn of the four
youths praising GOD while they are protected from flames of the fiery furnace. 
The Gospel is another of Jesus’ prophecies dealing with the destruction of
Jerusalem and the end times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading describes what takes place when the
Persian king, Darius, takes over the kingdom formerly held by the Babylonians. 
Darius decrees that for thirty days no worship is to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be given any person or GOD except to Darius himself.  Those
who have been out to remove Daniel from a position of favor are anxious to
catch Daniel breaking the law.  Once they have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>evidence of his worshiping the one true GOD, they bring
Daniel before the king to be executed by being thrown into a den of hungry
lions.  The king has taken a liking to Daniel, but he cannot save him because
once a law is proclaimed, it cannot be revoked. Daniel trusts in his GOD (the
truly one and only GOD) and is saved from the mouth of the lions.  The next
day, Darius approaches the lions’ den hoping that Daniel is still alive, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Daniel is alive.  Darius then has Daniel removed and praises
GOD.  Darius has Daniel’s accusers and their families thrown into the lions’
den where they are quickly devoured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial, also from an earlier part of the Book of
Daniel, is part of the joyous hymn sung by Daniel and his three companions when
they are thrown into the fiery furnace for not obeying the Babylonian king’s
order.  Even in the midst of the flames, that do not burn them, they sing GOD’s
praise.  Like other parts of the Book of Daniel, this reading is meant as an
encouragement for the people of GOD when they face persecution. No matter what,
they should sing GOD’s praise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus, in the Gospel, speaks of the calamity that will
accompany the destruction of Jerusalem (that occurred when the Romans destroy
the city in 70 AD).  It, too, is meant to encourage the faithful to be strong
in the face of opposition not only during the Roman destruction of Jerusalem
but whenever they face trying times.  Thus, the message</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ends with the reassurance that no matter what tragedies face
the believers, they must remain true to their relationship with the Lord Jesus
and in doing so they will experience the salvation that has been given to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we end this liturgical year, we are once again reminded
to be aware of the finiteness of our earthly existence.  We will die.  There is
no escaping death.  Yet, as I reminded a group of people recently, death is not
final.  It is merely a transition to another form of life – eternal life.  If
we have been seeking to be a part of GOD’s Reign, we will experience the gift
of eternal life that Jesus has earned for us through His death and
resurrection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, on the other hand, people have chosen to refuse to be a
part of GOD’s plan of salvation and worked against GOD, thus demonstrating that
they want nothing to do with GOD, GOD will respect their choice for all
eternity, and they will experience the absence of GOD forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Death and the end of our earthly existence may not be our
favorite topic to think about or discuss, but it is a reality that we have to
face.  It does not have to be a morbid or scary thought, but a necessary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reminder that we are not meant to live in our present
existence forever.  GOD desires that we live forever </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in heaven, experiencing the fullness of life that is
available to us through the death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have had the privilege of being with people as they
transition from this earthly existence to the one on the other side of the door
of death.  For those who had lived a life that developed their relationship
with GOD, it has been a peaceful, yet also tearful, experience.  As individuals
who are in the dying process approach the end of their time on earth, they
begin to let go of things and often seek to send their greetings of peace to
their loved ones.  The tears are those of loved ones who must say“good-bye” for
now, since there will be a separation from the way they have been in
relationship.  It is sensed as not a permanent departure, but rather as
“good-bye for now” with the expectation for a reunion on the other side of
death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, death is sad, particularly for those left alone by
their loved one’s departure.  Yet, our hope and belief as followers of the Lord
Jesus is that death is not final and the bonds of love that we experience in
this life will be even better when we have all “transitioned” to life of love
with the GOD Who is love.  We must face death as a part of the process of
existence.  But death, for the faithful, is not tragic in the overall picture,
but merely a transition to the better and fuller life that GOD has in store for
us.  We must have the same attitude of praise that is reflected by the youth in
the fiery furnace as they give voice to the glory and praise to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How do I view
death?   Do I spend time reflecting on the eventuality of the end of my earthly
existence?  How do I see myself preparing for my own death and the death of my
loved ones? Am I bolstered with the hope of eternal life that the Word of GOD
presents to me? Does my life give witness to my belief in life after death or
does my life reflect the attitude that I must get as much out of living on
earth since this is all I have?  How can I encourage others with the message of
hope in eternal life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, giver of life both earthly and
heavenly.  Through Your GOoDness, You want us to experience the fullness of
what You offer us while on earth, but not to become so attached to this short
existence that we do not seek the even better life that You have prepared for
us in heaven.  Your Son, Jesus, has come to live among us to show us the
importance of living on earth, but having our eyes also focused on living
forever with You.  His death and resurrection give us hope that we too can
experience life beyond the grave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the times we have focused only on life in the here and
now and not on the fullness of life with You on the other side of death, we
seek Your pardon and forgiveness.  May we approach our death with assurance of
eternal life and give You praise and glory for the relationship with You that
Your Son has made possible through His life, ministry, death, and
resurrection.  We lift up this prayer of praise in His name, for He is our
Master-Teacher and Lord Who has proceeded us through death into the eternal
life with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. 
Amen.</p>

https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-francesco-antonio-fasani</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:          Sirach 50: 22-24;      Psalm 145: 2-3,
4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11;      1 Corinthians 1: 3-9;         Luke 17: 11-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Thanksgiving to you! In this reflection I am using
some of the optional readings for Thanksgiving rather than readings for
Thursday of the Thirty-third Week in Ordinary Time.  The selected readings
speak of the importance of giving thanks.  Thanksgiving is much more than just
saying the words, “thank you” (although that is important and needs to be
taught to children and adults).  Our thanks must be demonstrated in our
lifestyle.  The passage from Sirach directs the faithful to bless (berakah) GOD
for all that GOD has done.  In blessing GOD, we will continue to be gifted by
GOD.  The Responsorial is from Psalm 145.  In it, the psalmist promises to
continue to give thanks to GOD and join the heavenly host in giving praise to
GOD.  St. Paul, in his letter to the Corinthians, reminds the faithful</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that he always gives thank to GOD for GOD’s blessing of
those who seek to follow the way of the Lord Jesus.  The Gospel relates the
account of Jesus’ healing of the ten lepers, of whom only one (a Samaritan)
returns to give thanks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Book of Sirach (not found in most Protestant Bibles) was
used in the early years of Christianity to teach those who were becoming
members of the Church.  It was used because of its moral directives.  It was
written in the second century before Jesus.  It has been found both in Greek
and Hebrew manuscripts, dating to pre-Christian times. Today’s passage is a
prayer that blesses GOD for all that GOD has done for each individual from the
time of his/her conception and throughout her/his life.  Because</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has been active in everyone’s life, each person should
berakah (bless/thank) GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is expressing the intention of the psalmist
to continue the praise and thanks to GOD for all that GOD has done.  This
blessing offered to GOD is both a personal and communal prayer, joined by all
creation (GOD’s works) and especially the faithful followers of the LORD GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, St. Paul informs the believers at
Corinth how grateful he is to GOD for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>revealing the GOoD News to the Corinthians.  Paul not only
thanks GOD for what GOD has done, but he expresses his appreciation for what
GOD will do for the faithful all the way until the Lord Jesus returns again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel takes place as Jesus continues His journey to
Jerusalem.  Ten lepers call out to Him and ask for His assistance.  Knowing
that they were not allowed to be where the “clean” or healthy people were, they
keep their distance and hope that Jesus would do something to remedy their
plight.  Compassionately, Jesus knows their desire and tells them to go and
show themselves to the priests who can declare a leper “clean”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and able to rejoin the people.  Only one of the healed
lepers returns to Jesus to say, “thank you.”  And this one was a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Samaritan, a non-Jew, one considered the most despicable by
a true Jewish believer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s holiday (holy-day) and the readings make me reflect
on two aspects of Thanksgiving: 1) the blessing aspect (berakah) of
thanksgiving; and 2) the connection of love and thanksgiving. It may seem
strange to “bless” GOD.  Some may say it is GOD Who blesses us, which is also
true.  We need to look at the Hebrew and scriptural meaning of the word</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>berakah. My understanding of this Hebrew word is that this
can be translate as “pray to,” “bless,” or “thank” GOD.  Many</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jewish prayers use this word (in an alternate form) in their
beginning, “Blessed are You, O LORD (Baruk atah Adonai - [The English spelling
of the Hebrew words may vary depending on the transliteration.]). . .”   GOD is
blessed! GOD is the Blessed One.  GOD is to be blessed (praised, thanked) by
us.  It is our appropriate response to Who GOD is, and who we are in
relationship to GOD.  GOD is to be blessed for all that GOD has done, is doing,
and will continue to do for us.  We</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are to berakah (praise, thank, and show our appreciation to)
GOD.  It is really the only attitude we can have to a GOD Who is so
compassionate, generous, and magnificent.  It is the proper way for us to
relate to GOD.  We must have an attitude of gratitude to GOD for all GOD has
done.  We should be constantly saying, “Baruk atah Adonai – Blessed are You, O </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD.” [This is the reason that I begin most of my
reflection prayers with the words, “Blessed are You, LORD GOD. . .”]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second aspect of thanksgiving I would like to share with
you is that of our loving action in response to being grateful to GOD.  In some
ways we can never really thank GOD fully for what all GOD has done for us. 
Yet, we can live an attitude of gratitude so that others know we are grateful
to GOD.  The way we show (clothe ourselves with) thankfulness is by caring for
and loving others as GOD cares for and loves us.  That is what Jesus said to
His disciples on the night before He died.  It is interesting to me that Jesus
prayed the traditional Passover prayers that night (John 15: 9-17).  He would
have frequently begun His prayers with “Baruk atah Adonai.” Jesus then told His
disciples to do what He did, both in words and in action.  They were to “bless
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD” by acting in the same loving manner as their Master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For humans, besides praising GOD and giving GOD thanks in
prayer, one of the best ways we can truly demonstrate our gratitude is by
treating others with love and compassion. In that, we will be loving one
another in the very way GOD has loved, and continues to love, us, especially as
seen in the life and ministry of Jesus.  We should do more than just say “thank
you” to those who have been kind and generous to us.  We should act in kind, gentle,
compassionate, and loving ways</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>toward others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In one of the last assembly at school before one
Thanksgiving break, one of the teachers addressed the middle school students. 
The instructor told them to express their gratitude by helping their parents in
the preparation for, and clean up from, Thanksgiving supper.  This would be one
way that they could demonstrate how thankful they were to their parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>May this day be an opportunity for you to bless GOD
especially as you serve those around you with loving care.  May this day lead
you to be even more compassionate, kind, humble, gentle, patient, forbearing,
forgiving, peaceful, and loving. For it is in doing those things that you will
be demonstrating your attitude of gratitude to the GOD Who has demonstrated all
those attributes – and more – to you!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  For what gift(s)
from GOD am I most grateful? Can others see my attitude of gratitude in the way
I live my life? Does my life bless (berakah) GOD? Do I treat others in a way
that manifest the thanks I have to GOD for what GOD has done for me? Do I
sincerely express my gratitude to the people who touch and enrich my life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baruk atah Adonai! Blessed are You, O LORD GOD, for You have
continually given us life, love, and gifts too numerous to even mention.  Yet,
like nine of the ten lepers whom Your Son healed, we often go about our daily
activities without turning back to You and giving thanks.  We come together
today with members of our family and friends in order to celebrate our
collective thankfulness to You for gifting us as a nation.  You have shown Your
love and compassion during our formative years and during our 247 years as a
nation which claims to be “under GOD.”  We thank You and bless You for guiding us. 
We seek Your pardon for the times we have taken Your kindness for granted.  We
also ask for Your forgiveness for the times when we have failed to show our
appreciation to the countless people who have graced our lives, especially our
parents and family members. Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, we ask that
You strengthen us so that we can put our attitude of gratitude into practice,
not just today, but every day of our lives.  May we fulfill the command of Your
Son, Jesus, and love one another as He has loved us.  May we be willing to be
of service to each other as Jesus lovingly served His disciples and all people
who turned to Him.  It is in His name that we lift up this prayer of blessing
to You, for He is our Master-Teacher.  He has shown us how to bless You by His
action.  It is He Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>November 28, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of Thirty-fourth Week in Ordinary Time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from:

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint James of the Marche:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-james-of-the-marche</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Daniel 7: 2-14;        Daniel 3: 75, 76, 77, 78,
79, 80, 81;        Luke 21:29-33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, the readings are apocalyptic.  [Apocalyptic
comes from the Greek words αποκάλυψις (apokalypsis) meaning “revelation” or
“disclosure.” Not only does it refer to something that is being revealed, but
also it is often associated with the end of time and, sometimes, a message of
doom, particularly for the wicked.]  The passage from Daniel speaks about the
succession of kingdoms that rule over Israel until GOD establishes an
everlasting kingdom.  The Responsorial continues the hymn of all creation
praising GOD.  The Gospel is a challenge to be ready for the final coming of
the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from Daniel describes the four</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>kingdoms that existed between the Babylonian Exile and the
time of destruction of the Temple by Antiochus Epiphanes.  The first beast is a
winged lion and symbolizes the Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar and
Belshazzar.  The bear is the second beast and alludes to the Median kingdom.
The quick moving leopard refers to the kingdom of Cyrus and the Persians.  The
fourth beast, the most terrible of the four, is the Greek kingdom under the ten
Seleucid kings, of which Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the worst since he
destroyed the Temple and killed many of the faithful Jews until the Maccabean
Revolt.  The reading is meant to inspire and encourage the faithful with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promise of a new and everlasting kingdom</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>established by GOD in which the people of GOD would
experience the joy of the coming of the Son of Man (the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Messiah, the Anointed One, the Christ) as the one sent by
the Ancient One (GOD the Abba-Father).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is another section of the hymn of praise
sung by the Jewish young men as they walk amid the fiery furnace, and that has
been our Responsorial for most of this week.  It calls upon all of creation to
join in exalting the Lord GOD forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel Jesus uses the imagery of being able to
ascertain the season by looking at the signs manifested by the change in nature
and being able to realize that the final Reign of GOD is at hand when the signs
that Jesus has predicted occur.  These words are a call of vigilance for the
disciples of the Lord Jesus.  The followers of Jesus must be prepared for the
final coming of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As modern-day missional disciples of the Lord Jesus, we,
too, are given a call to action.  The readings today describe a two-fold
response from us:  1) vigilance and 2) exaltation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Vigilance is the awareness of what is happening or about to
happen. It demands preparation and sensitivity.  We must be ready for whatever happens,
even if it means being willing to suffer for the sake of the Reign of GOD
coming among us.  It also means we must be concerned, not only for ourselves
(fellow believers), but also for those who have</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not yet accepted the coming Reign of GOD.  It is a challenge
for us to be prophets and evangelists – spokespersons for GOD and announcers of
GOoD News.  Again, we do not have to set up soap boxes on street corners and
start preaching doomsday proclamation.  Our lives should give witness to the
“already, but not yet” coming of GOD’s presence in the world.  Our lives must
reflect that we have accepted, and live by, the GOoD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>News of GOD’s presence with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second part of the call to action is that of exaltation. 
We are called to praise GOD and joyfully acknowledge the mighty deeds that GOD
has done, is doing, and will continue to do in the establishing of the Reign of
Heaven among us.  Our very beings must magnify and praise GOD.  If we are aware
of how our actions proclaim GOD’s GOoDness, then we will exalt the Lord Jesus
in everything we do.  It is also important that we join with others who are
also exalting GOD.  After all, in the final coming of the Lord Jesus, all
creation will exalt and praise and glorify GOD forever, as the Responsorial
proclaims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I read these
readings, what thoughts come to mind?  Do I sense foreboding or excitement (or
both)?  What do I think is my calling in response to the readings? How can I
prepare myself and others for the coming Reign of GOD, that is “already, but
not yet” among us?  In what ways can I give witness to the GOoD News of the
Coming of the Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all You have created –
everything.   Through Your GOoDness You have extended Your gifts to us.  You
invite us to be part of Your Reign that will reach its climax when Your Son
comes again at the end of time.  The invitation You have given us is not to be
passive spectators, but to be actively involved in the coming of Your Reign. 
You call us to vigilance and exaltation.  Yet, because sometimes we have failed
to take seriously the immediacy of the need to proclaim Your Reign, we have
allowed ourselves to become sidetracked into focusing on the secular and
material rule of the world.  We ask Your forgiveness and Your strength to
repent and re-dedicate ourselves to being actively involved in the coming of
Your Reign.  With the continued graces that flow from Your Holy Spirit, helps
us to stay attuned to our calling of proclaiming Your GOoD News to others and
lifting up hymns of praise and glory to You.  We praise You especially for the
first coming of Your Son, Jesus, Who began Your Reign on earth and Who was, and
still is, the great</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Master-Teacher, giving us an example of how we can announce
the message, not only through words, but also by actions.  We join Him in
making this prayer of exaltation as we not only joyfully anticipate, but also
work toward, the final establishment of Your Reign, for You are our GOD,
together with Jesus, Your Son, and the Holy Spirit, the one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Clement:

feast is on November 23]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Daniel 7: 15-27;       Daniel 3: 82, 83, 84, 85,
86, 87;       Luke 21: 34-36</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is the last day of the liturgical and ecclesiastical
year and the transition day to the new year that begins tomorrow.  The readings
are also both ending and transition.  The First Reading is the end of our
readings from the Book of Daniel and the end of the vision of Daniel concerning
the four kingdoms that ruled over the Jewish people and their world from the
time of the Babylonian captivity until the Greek occupation under Antiochus IV
Epiphanes.  The Responsorial are some of the final verses of the hymn of praise
by the Jewish youth in the fiery furnace.  The Gospel is a transition to
Advent, since part of the Gospel will be repeated during Advent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This final section of our reading from the Book of Daniel
focuses on the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes.  It was during his reign that, not
only was the Temple in Jerusalem desecrated by having sacrilegious ceremonies
taking place there, but also the Jewish people were forced to defile themselves
or face persecution and death.  The reading gives hope that the holy people,
that is, those who remain faithful to GOD, will see and be part of the new
Reign of GOD that will be an everlasting domain.  The Son of Man is identified
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>linked to all the holy people who experience what the
Ancient One (GOD) does to rid the world of the beast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The 3½ years of persecution alludes to half of the
perfection number (7), thus signifying imperfection, and it also is
approximately how long the reign of terror was inflicted by Antiochus upon the
faithful Jews until the Maccabean revolt reached its climax and the Temple was
dedicated on what has come to be known as the Feast of Lights or the Feast of
Dedication (Hanukkah).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is the last part of the hymn of the young
Jewish men who were cast into the fiery furnace. The hymn reaches its climax in
the praise by humans, especially the holy ones of GOD.  We have seen in the
earlier verses (that were our Responsorials earlier in the week) that all of
creation has been invited to praise, exalt, and bless GOD.  Now, the crescendo
of praise is reached as GOD’s holy people join the exaltation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we move from Ordinary Time into</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advent, today’s Gospel reminds us that we are to be vigilant
so that we can be prepared for the rough times that will precede the return of
the Son of Man – Jesus.  Life on earth is filled with challenges and hardships
(as we have experienced recently climatically [with extreme heat and stormy
weather], pandemically, and politically); yet these are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not what await those who remain ready and who joyfully
anticipate Jesus’ return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our readings, although a bit uncomfortable for me and others
since they speak of difficult times of suffering, are also filled with joy. 
The trials and tribulations of this life will eventually be over and we will be
part of the holy ones (saints) who share in the Reign of the Lord Jesus when He
comes to establish His everlasting dominion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I took a little break from the hectic pace of the world
last week on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>American Thanksgiving Day, I reflected on how great it will
be when we will be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>able to sit at the heavenly banquet table and enjoy the
unending feast that GOD has prepared for us.  Jokingly I said to myself, “It
will be great to savor a great meal without having to prepare it or clean up
after it.”  As I spent the time in the kitchen both before and after our
family’s festive meal, I was reminded that I have not yet arrived at that point
of endless feasting without work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, preparing food and cleaning up are not the worst of
what awaits us before we meet the Lord Jesus when</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He returns again.  We face greater challenges when we will
be called upon to demonstrate our faith commitments </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to GOD.  We can expect to face people who do not accept us
or what we stand for – our relationship with the Lord Jesus.  Some people see
in the events of recent years (with laws allowing marriage of same sex
individuals, abortion, mercy killing, and the persecution in the military of
people who profess their faith, and social and political unrest) a sign of the
trials for being a Christian.  We must be willing to profess our belief in Who
GOD is, even in the face of opposition.  We need to live vigilant lives that
manifest that our eyes are focused on the heavenly Reign, not just on earthly
pleasures and happiness.  That is not always easy in a world that is so caught
up with itself and immediate gratification and narrow mindedness.  Yet, if we
can remain determined in our preparation for the return of the Lord Jesus, then
we can join in today’s Responsorial verses that say, “Holy people of humble
heart, bless the LORD, praise and exalt GOD above all forever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What aspect of my
life is coming to an end? Am I experiencing a time of transition in my life?
What are my thoughts and feelings as I face the end of one aspect of my life or
a transition in my life?  What does that say to me about the end of my life and
the transition to eternal life?  How can I better sign forth to others the
sense of joy in making the transition to the eternal blessing of GOD’s Reign?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD GOD of all times and peoples. 
Through Your GOoDness You have prepared a heavenly banquet feast for Your Holy
People.  This has been Your promise.  It awaits all those who accept Your
invitation and prepare for the arrival of Your Reign by living lives that give
witness to You, and praise and exalt You above all forever.  Yet, there have
been times when we have chosen not to focus on what lies ahead for us, but we
have become immersed in the pleasures and pursuits of this sinful world.  We
seek Your pardon for failing to prepare ourselves and joyfully anticipating
Your promises.  As we come to the end of one liturgical year and look forward
to another, help us take the time to reflect on how our journey to be with You
has been during this last year.  With the guidance of Your Holy Spirit and the
example of Your Son, Jesus, gives us the strength to make corrections to our
orientation so that we can be more prepared for whatever lies ahead of us in
the near future, so that we can joyfully bless, praise, and exalt You forever. 
We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, Our Brother and Savior, Who
is the Way to You, and Who is coming again to take us to be with You, and Who
is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Francesco Antonio Fasani: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-francesco-antonio-fasani</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 2: 1-5;       Psalm 122: 1-2, 3-4, 4-5,
6-7, 8-9;       Romans 13: 11-14;       Matthew 24: 37-44</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Advent, that we begin today, comes from the Latin adventus
meaning “coming.” The “Coming” of our GOD will have different results.  The
First Reading envisions the new world order that will be established when the
LORD “comes.” The Responsorial Psalm describes the joy of those “coming” into
the house of the LORD.  In the Second Reading, St. Paul reminds his readers
that they must be prepared for the time is at hand when the darkness will be
turned into light as the Lord Jesus “comes” again.  In the Gospel, Jesus
foretells that the time of the “coming” of the Son of Man will catch some
people off guard and some will be left behind while others will move on to be
with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Verse 4 of today’s First Reading is inscribed on a statue at
the United Nations Building in New York (see image to the left) and gives us
hope that, before our GOD “comes” again, nations will turn their instruments of
war into tools of production of food for all peoples.  Isaiah prophesies that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there will be peace, joy, and enlightenment as GOD “comes”
to establish a new Reign over all peoples, even though GOD will judge and
impose terms on people – on those who have not given their allegiance to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s psalm is one voiced by pilgrims as they journey up
to the house of the LORD – the Temple in Jerusalem. They are “coming” into
GOD’s presence and great expectations and excitement fill them as they draw
ever nearer to the time when they will actually be in GOD’s house.  Being with
the LORD GOD brings a sense of peace as people pray for each other’s GOoD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our Second Reading, St. Paul addresses his words to the
faithful in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rome.  He urges them to be prepared and turn from the
darkness they have been in and look toward the dawning Light.  He tells them
that the time for them to do it is right </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>now, because the time of salvation (the time when GOD fulfills
all the divine promises) is “coming” nearer now than it has ever been.  They
are to live lives devoid of the dark deeds of their past.  They are to put on
armor of Light and be prepared for the Lord Jesus Who is “coming” again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus predicts that the Son of Man will
“come” at a time when some people do not expect.  Those who are ready will be
able to enter into the GOD’s presence forever, while those who are not ready
will be left behind.  Being prepared is crucial for the disciples of the Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always am excited during this time of Advent.  It is not
because I know that Christmas is less than four weeks away.  It is because the
readings of this first part of Advent remind us that the Lord Jesus is
“coming,” not as a baby born as He was some 2000 years ago.  The Lord Jesus is
“coming” again to take those who are ready into the Light of the new world that
He has prepared for us.  Maybe my excitement comes from the realization that I
am closer now than I ever have been to my meeting the Lord Jesus when He
“comes” for me (either at the end of time or at the moment of my death).  I
particularly am  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>moved by this time of the year, as I get up in the darkness
and cold and gradually begin to see the warming light of a new day dawning.  I
also notice that leaves are falling or have fallen, and the trees and plants
are dying.  It is almost winter in the Northern Hemisphere, when darkness seems
to overtake the world.  Yet in the darkness there are signs of light, both the
colored lights of the season, and the natural light of a new day dawning.  We
will celebrate that the Unconquerable “Sun/Son” will win the battle against the
force of darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to be overwhelmed by the negativity and darkness
around us.  There always seems to be some people and nations fighting with
others.  We have been facing rough times over the last few years with illnesses
and natural disasters, wars in various parts of the world, and with violence. 
Crimes and evil deeds are performed in the darkness.  It can be scary. To what
is our world “coming”? Yet this season of Advent reminds us that there will be
joy, peace, understanding, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>hope when the Lord Jesus “comes” again, at least for those
who are prepared for His “coming.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The challenge of this season of Advent is to be ready for
the Lord Jesus’ “coming.” We must work as much as we can to cooperate with the
process of turning swords into plowshares.  We must be people of the Light –
the Light Who is Jesus Christ.  Our former deeds of darkness must be left
behind and we must put on the armor of Light and be clothed in Christ Jesus, or
we will be the ones left behind as the Lord Jesus “comes” to claim the final
victory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also reminded that to do this, we must be Adventurous.
We must exert our attention and efforts into doing the deeds of the Light.  It
is important that we take seriously this season of Advent and strive to put a
little more into our living as disciples of the Lord Jesus.  It might mean that
we spend as much time bringing true peace and joy to others as we decorate our
homes and purchase gifts for people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The time is now for us to do all we can to be prepared for
the Lord Jesus’ “Coming” for us.  We cannot put off until</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>later our living as disciples of our Master-Teacher. For we
may not have time later to show our allegiance to the Lord Jesus and His
Abba-Father. GOD has given us this chance to better prepare ourselves for
Jesus’ “Coming,” not just the celebration of His first “Coming” when He was
born in Bethlehem, but also for His “Coming” at the end (the end of the world
or the end of our individual lives here on earth).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, it is true that those who are not prepared will be left
behind.  But that does not have to be us.  All we need do is accept the gifts
that GOD has given us and live a life of Light, peace, and joy.  The more we
live out our faith, then the more prepared we will be to make the final steps
into the GOD’s house when Jesus “Comes” to get us to take us to our eternal
home-“Coming.” We will be able to rejoice as we journey toward the Lord Jesus
Who is “Coming” to take us into</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the heavenly home forever.  You still have time, if you
begin right now.  And our living as pro-active and prepared disciples may help
others to join us.  Are you ready?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How ready am I to
meet the Lord Jesus when He “comes” for me? How am I furthering the Reign of
God by working for peace and justice? What practical thing(s) can I do during
this season of Advent to bring the true sense of joy and light into the life of
those who are presently experiencing cold and darkness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of peace, joy, and Light. 
Through Your GOoDness, we have the opportunity to accept Your invitation to
enter Your house as You have sent Your Son to “Come” to us and brings us in. 
We have been out in the dark and cold at times in our lives.  We have performed
deeds of darkness.  Yet through Your Son’s first “Coming” among us, You have
given us the hope that we can leave the dark and walk into Your Light. With the
continued guidance of Your Holy Spirit, helps us to prepare for Jesus’ “Coming”
again by putting on the armor of Light</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>as we clothe ourselves with Christ the Light.   Help us make
GOoD use of this season of Advent to commit ourselves more fully to working for
the spread of Your GOoD News as we meet and greet others during this season. 
We thank You for giving us this time, right now, to be  Adventurous as we
joyfully await the “Coming” of the Lord, Your Son, Jesus, Who first “Came” and
lived among us, ministered to us, suffered and died, and rose for us.  It is He
Who is living and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only God,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Charles de Foucauld: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-charles-de-foucauld/
Readings: Isaiah 2: 1-5;           Psalm 122: 1-2, 3-4b, 4cd-5, 6-7,
8-9;           Matthew 8: 5-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings today give us another glimpse of the Reign of
GOD to come.  Isaiah sees what Jerusalem will be like in the future.  It is
also a pre-figurement of the Reign of Heaven.  The psalm is one of the
pilgrimage psalms said by those on their way to Jerusalem to be in GOD’s
dwelling place.  It, too, should be the prayer of those awaiting the final
coming of the Reign of GOD.  In the Gospel, Jesus speaks about the Reign of
Heaven telling His disciples it may be a bit different than what some expect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah’s words about the future rule by GOD in the Temple
(the divine house) on the holy mountain (in Jerusalem) were words that the
chosen people had longed to hear.  They had been ruled by human kings who had
led them down the wrong paths to sinful ways.  They wanted GOD to establish the
divine rule again.  With GOD’s Reign begun, GOD’s dwelling place would be were
people would come to live in peace as GOD would judge the nations.  There, the
implements of war would be turned into instruments of food production,
benefitting all.  The message is outside the United Nations Building in New
York.  This passage is seen by Christians to symbolize the coming into the
Reign of Heaven at the end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the psalm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>response, we sense that for faithful Jews it was a special
blessing to be able to make a pilgrimage to the House of the LORD – the Temple
in Jerusalem.  As they approached the Holy City of GOD’s dwelling place, they
would rejoice.  Even though the believers were aware of GOD being with them
everywhere, coming to the Temple was a unique and holy time of praising GOD in
GOD’s special place of presence.  Jerusalem was experienced as its name
implied, a place “of peace.”   This psalm also is seen by Christians as
symbolizing the joy of entering into the eternal dwelling place of GOD in
heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus encounters a heathen (pagan, non-Jew)
army officer who asks Him for a special favor – the healing of his servant. 
Jesus is willing to come into a non-Jewish home in order to bring salus –
healing, wholeness, salvation.  It was unheard of for a faithful Jew to enter
into a gentile’s home, because Jews were considered better than the “faithless
pagans.” The centurion professes his unworthiness to have Jesus enter his home
and asks that Jesus just speak words of salus. Jesus praises the faith of this
heathen and informs His disciples that many such “heathens” will find a place
of honor in the Reign of GOD because of their faith, something hard to accept by
supposedly “faithful” Jews.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Advent journey, awaiting the Final Coming
of the Lord Jesus, we should be filled with joyful anticipation of the Lord
Jesus’ return and His taking us to the presence of His Abba-Father, Who happens
to be GOD.  As the Jewish pilgrims anxiously journeyed to GOD’s presence in
which they experienced peace, so we too should continue our pilgrimage as we
await the Lord Jesus’ coming to take us into the fullness of the Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago in the fall, I audited a class at Azusa
Pacific University. The class was entitled “Terrorism, War, and Peace.”  During
the class, and again today, I was thinking about today’s passage from Isaiah
that is quoted at the United Nations in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New York: “They shall beat their swords into plowshares and
their spears into pruning hooks.  One nation shall not raise the sword against
another, nor shall they train for war again.” As we face the continuation of
the war in various place on our planet, and violent terrorism, and have soldiers
fighting and dying throughout the world, and we hear of terrorists and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gun-toting individuals who are bombing civilian areas such
as hotels, restaurants, schools, busses, churches, synagogues, mosques, and
trains, and as we see people demonstrating against the war on terrorism, police
brutality, and political leadership in our country, I wonder how faithful we
are to GOD’s wishes to work for peace and to continue to work for the Reign of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I realize that Jesus said that there would be wars and insurrections
before His final coming, but are we seeking to bring about His final coming by
waging war?  Or should we be seeking to establish a place where GOD’s peace has
already begun and thus show that we are ready for the Lord Jesus’ coming?
Sometimes the establishment of peace takes a great deal of work and effort, as
we turn weapons of war into useful means of producing food.  Sometimes it takes
a policing force to make it safe to establish areas of food production and to
create food and other necessities of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am not condoning the evil deeds of war mongers,
terrorists, and mass shooters.  Evil doers must be confronted and made to pay
for their injustices.  That, too, is part of establishing GOD’s Reign.  The
question to be asked is:  “Are we doing the right and loving things to help
establish true peace and justice in the world?” I know there are scriptural
passages that can be used on both sides of the issue of war and conflict.  I am
just trying to raise our consciousness of what it means to be a follower of the
Lord Jesus as we await His coming again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is true that there will not be the fullness of peace
until the Lord Jesus comes again and establishes the Reign of GOD forever. 
Yet, we are called to be a part of GOD’s Reign right now.  We should be doing
all we can to prepare for the coming of the Lord Jesus.  We need to realize
that we are on the pilgrimage to the House of our GOD (that is in heaven and in
the “new” earth), being led by the Lord Jesus.  We must do whatever is
necessary to help others also travel along the path to arrive at the dwelling
place of GOD.  We should do what we can to stop gun violence, whether that be
by supporting gun control, or making sure that mentally unstable individuals
have a way to be peaceful rather than violent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I read the last verses of today’s Gospel, I am reminded
that many of us may be shocked when we enter the fullness of GOD’s Reign and
see who else is reclining at the table of the Lord Jesus.  Some people whom we
thought were our enemies here on earth may be there along with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob.  (I am not referring to people who are terrorists and who purposely
inflict death and injury on innocent people, but people whom we might label
“heathen” like the centurion in the Gospel.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does this lead me to do? Firstly, I must realize that I
am on a pilgrimage.  The place through which I am journeying now is not my
final destination.  I must not become too attached to what is here right now. 
Secondly, I must be ready for when the Lord Jesus returns (whether that is at
the end of my personal life, or at the end of time).  I must live a life of
joyful anticipation of the Lord Jesus’ leading me along the final paths to the
dwelling place of GOD.  Thirdly, I must be active in bringing about the Reign
of GOD by working for peace and justice in the world today.  I must help raise
my personal consciousness and that of others.  I personally must see what I can
do to turn weapons of war into instruments of peace and justice and rid the
world of evil.  I must work for the righting of wrongs, but in a just way, not
a vindictive way. That is no easy task.  Yet if I really believe that the Lord
Jesus is the Coming One (Adventus), I must be proactive.  And finally, I must
say with the last verse of today’s Responsorial Psalm: “Because of the house of
the LORD, our GOD, I will pray for your GOoD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What is my
understanding of the Reign of GOD? Do I see it only as futuristic dream? Am I
working for the realization of the Reign of GOD right now? What can I do to
help others focus on the still coming, but already present, Reign of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, O LORD, GOD of love and mercy.  Because of
Your GOoDness, You desire that we be with You in the Reign of Heaven.  Yet, You
have placed us here on earth at this moment in time, to journey towards You and
make a difference as we make our pilgrimage to Your presence.  You ask us to
work for the establishment of Your Reign by following the example of Your Son,
Jesus.  He worked for peace and justice, that at times included challenging
those who were leading others astray.  We have sometime failed to accept Your
invitation to journey along with Your Son.  We have chosen to focus only on the
pleasures we experience en route, and not on the end of our pursuit.  We have
refused to get involved in activities that promote Your Reign, because it would
cost us too much individually or collectively.  You continue to call us to
prepare the way for the final coming of Your Son.  It is He Who is our Guide
and our Way, and it is He Who proclaimed Your Reign in words and actions.  In
His name we lift up this prayer of praise and honor for He has won the ultimate
victory over evil and death by His own death and resurrection, and He now is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

Readings:  Isaiah 11: 1-10;       Psalm 72: 1-2, 7-8, 12-13, 17;       Luke 10:
21-24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Reign of GOD has begun, but it is not yet completed. 
The readings speak about certain characteristics of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the Reign of GOD.  Isaiah forecasts that when the Descendant
of Jesse (who was the father of King David) comes, that Offspring of Jesse will
be filled with the Holy Spirit and will establish a Reign of Peace (Shalom).
The psalm also speaks about the peace and justice flourishing in the time of
the Son of the great King.  In the Gospel, Jesus shows that He has received
knowledge, power, and authority from His Abba-Father and the Holy Spirit, and
He can pass on those gifts to whomever He wishes, thus to all who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are open to the gifts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, Isaiah tries to inspire the people of
Israel with hope that GOD will continue to bless all the people through the
Davidic line.  GOD once gave the power and authority to rule the nation to
David and his descendants. During the time of David’s son, King Solomon, the
kingdom spread to its furthest extent and peace and prosperity reigned in the
land.  Isaiah promises</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that even a greater Reign will be established when another
Descendant of David comes.  The new Reign will be as great or even greater than
at the “perfect” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>time of Adam and Eve when even the animals were not at odds
with each other. It will be a time of GOD’s justice and peace being extended to
all nations and to all creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm picks up the theme of peace and justice coming
through the royal lineage.  In the prayer, the psalmist asks GOD to continue blessing
the offspring of the king so that all people, especially the poor and lowly
(the Anawim) will be treated not only fairly, but compassionately.  The
implication is that some of the rulers have not always reigned with GOD’s
justice, but with selfish motives.  Yet, a time will come when GOD’s Reign will
be established and bring about fair treatment of all people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus informs His disciples that His Abba-
Father, Who is GOD, has entrusted to Him full authority to usher in the Reign
of truth, justice, and peace.  Through the power of GOD’s Holy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spirit, Jesus is beginning the Reign of Heaven.  He also
confirms that many people before His time had longed to see the beginning of
the Reign of GOD, but they were not fortunate enough to be alive at the time of
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I realize that we are living
during the interim between the beginning of the Reign of GOD begun by Jesus
during His earthly, human life and the final days of the Reign that will come
when Jesus returns again.  We are privileged to exist at this time.  We have
benefitted from the beginning of the Reign and can look forward to its
completion.  We are more blessed than those who lived before Jesus because we
are seeing the Reign develop and head towards its fullness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet, with that privilege comes responsibility.  Americans
are a part of a country that is on the forefront of the world’s privileged. 
This position demands that we reach out to the people of the poorer nations, so
being part of the Reign of GOD requires that we work to bring about GOD’s peace
and justice and spread the benefits of the Reign to others.  This is also true
for all nations, even those of the “Third World.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does that mean for me practically? If I really believe
that Jesus has begun the Reign of GOD, then I must do all I can to further the
spread of that Reign.  The readings today speak about the characteristics of
that Reign:  peace, justice, understanding, counsel, caring, compassion, and
love.  All of these point outward from me to others.  Those are the very
attributes that I should strive to make part of my own way of life.  It doesn’t
necessarily mean that I have to be an in-the-limelight activist who is trying
to change the whole world.  I must bring out GOD’s Reign in the part of the
Reign in which I live – within my family, at my work or school, in my local
community, and globally.  I must treat everyone with the same compassion that
Jesus does.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since I am living in the “already, but not yet” time of the
Reign of GOD, I also have to realize that I can make a difference, but I should
not expect that I will necessarily see the fruits of my efforts.  The final
results will not be fully known until the Lord Jesus comes again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am reminded of this as an educator and catechist.  I am in
a unique position of helping young minds (and even old minds) come to learn and
develop in the process of becoming all that they can be.  Most of the time I am
not sure what effect I make in the lives of those I have instructed.  I have
had the special blessing of having some former students, whose lives I have
touched, get in touch with me and share with me how something I said or
something I did for them made a difference in their lives.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am also in touch with some of the members of the Youth Ministry
of which I was leader over 40 years ago.  Yet, I must keep on opening people’s
minds even when I do not see the results.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of us can make a difference in other people’s lives. 
We can treat people with care, compassion, justice, and peace.  We can bring
about the Reign of GOD in other individuals’ lives.  We can help them realize
that GOD is reigning in their lives by letting them experience the joys of
GOD’s Reign and by informing them the fullness of that Reign is yet to come in
even greater ways when the Lord Jesus returns.  We can point to fact that there
will be a day when the Lord Jesus comes again and “justice will flower in His
days, and profound peace till the moon be no more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How have I
experienced the Reign of GOD in my life when I have been treated with peace,
justice, compassion, and love? Do I believe I can make a difference in the
lives of others?   What can I do to enable others to experience the
characteristics of the Reign of GOD in their lives?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, origin of every loving and kind
deed. Through Your GOoDness, You want all people to be a part of Your Reign.
You have promised us a time of peace that is far beyond our imagination. You
have sent Your Son to usher in that Reign of peace. Jesus has given us a
glimpse of what lies ahead. He has asked us to spread the GOoD News of that
Reign by being living examples of peace, justice, compassion, and love. At
times we have failed to realize what Your Reign is all about. We have missed
opportunities to share the message of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOoD News with others. We ask for Your pardon and
forgiveness. As Jesus was aware of the Holy Spirit’s power in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His life, so make us attuned to the gifts of wisdom,
understanding, GOoD counsel, and right judgment that come from Your Spirit. May
we go out as Your ambassadors of peace and justice and touch the lives of the
people whom we meet. For this we give You glory and praise as we live in Your
Reign that has begun and still waits to be fulfilled. It is in Jesus’ name we
make this prayer, for He is the One Who has instituted Your Reign by His living
among us, and it is He Who will bring it to completion when He comes again. He
is our Lord and Savior Who is living and reigning in the Your heavenly Reign
together with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Francis Xavier</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Wed. of 1st Week of Advent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Francis Xavier:
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-francis-xavier</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings: Isaiah 25: 6-10a;         Psalm 23: 1-3a, 3b-4, 5,
6;          Matthew 15: 29-37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Reign of GOD is marked by celebration and feasting. 
Isaiah remarks that the LORD of Hosts will provide a banquet with choice food
and fine drink.  The familiar Psalm 23 portrays GOD as the Shepherd Who cares
for each sheep of the flock leading them to a time of feasting in the sight of
their foes.  In the Gospel, Jesus first compassionately heals those who are ill
and disabled.  He then multiples the food for the hungry crowd, providing so
much food that there was more leftover than was present before the feeding
began.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading Isaiah reassures the deposed people of
Israel that GOD has not forgotten them but will lead them to the divine
mountain where GOD will take care of all their needs.  Not only will GOD
provide the bare necessities, GOD will provide rich, choice food and the best
drinks possible. GOD’s provision will lead to great rejoicing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A similar theme comes in the psalm today. GOD will not only
lead the Chosen People to a place of safety and security, just as a shepherd
tends the flock. GOD will also provide a sense of peace in the face of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>difficult times.  Finally, GOD will spread out a banquet
table for those in GOD’s care.  Abundance of food and drink will also be
present, while the enemies of GOD’s people can only look on while GOD’s Chosen
Ones feast to their hearts’ content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus demonstrates the essential message of
Reign of GOD not just in words, but also in action.  Compassionately, Jesus
first tends to those who are physically hampered from enjoying the blessings of
the Reign of GOD.  Jesus brings salus (healing, wholeness, salvation) to those
who are less than whole.  He heals the blind, lame, deaf, and dumb.  Seeing the
needs of all the crowd, Jesus shows GOD’s benevolence by feeding the throngs of
people.  Jesus first asks His disciples what they have in the way of food to
feed the multitude.  He then gives not only what is needed to survive the
journey, but also more than enough, so that everyone is fully satiated and
there is still plenty left over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of things run through my mind as I reflect on the
readings.  The first is the “already, but not yet” nature of the “coming”
(adventus) of the Reign of GOD.  Through the ministry of Jesus, the Reign of
GOD has already</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>begun.  We are already beneficiaries of GOD’s compassion.
Yet the fullness of the blessings of the Reign of GOD are yet to be
experienced.  We have not yet come to know and see the extent to which GOD will
go in letting us be a part of the “coming” Reign.  To put it in a phrase, “we
haven’t seen anything yet.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second thing that comes to me is tied to the first. 
There might still be some trying times ahead before we reach the house of our
GOD where GOD will reign majestically forever.  The psalm speaks of this when
it says that peace comes even to those who are walking through the valley of
darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am both excited and a bit apprehensive. I like the idea
that the Reign of GOD has already begun and that even better things are in
store for us.  I am a bit un-eased at the prospect of having to travel through
more darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was talking to friends who shared with me some of the
struggles they were undergoing. Each of them asked me, in so many words, “Why
am I going through these rough times when I already have experienced trying
times and thought that I was finally getting over them and then this new
stumbling block fell in my path?  I have tried to be aware of GOD’s presence
with me, but it is difficult as I am faced with new problems.” These thoughts
may have struck many of us in these past few year as we have felt the effects
of the Covid-19 pandemic, disasters (such as fires and hurricanes and drought)
caused by climate changes, wars, shooters in schools, theaters, parades,
stores, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I shared with my friends, and I now share with you, that,
like Job, we often have to go through rough times because we are drawing closer
to the Lord Jesus, or in reality, the Lord Jesus is “coming” closer to us.  If
we are not close to Him, the enemy will not attack us because we are no threat
to the enemy.  The closer we come to the Lord Jesus, the more the enemy attacks
us to try to make us doubt the fullness of the Reign of GOD that is already
here in some sense, but it is fully “coming” when the Lord Jesus returns again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of this leads me to keep my eyes focused on the “already,
but not yet” Reign of GOD.  Jesus has ushered in that Reign.  He has reached
out His compassionate arms and heart to us.  He has begun the process of giving
us salus (healing, wholeness, salvation).  The fullness, however, of the Reign
is not with us.  We still have to go through some dark valleys and face trying
times.  We are not yet perfected in a way in which we will be when we enter the
final Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are truly “in between.” We are between the beginning of
the Reign of GOD and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>its completion.  We are still on the journey.  We sometimes
get glimpses of what is to come.  We begin living the life of the Reign of GOD
by our reaching out with the compassion of Jesus.  If we stay on the path on
which the Shepherd is leading us, we will arrive at the banquet feast in the
Reign of GOD.  It is then that we will be able to say with the psalmist today,
“And I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for years to come.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was reminded what it means to dwell in the house of the
LORD on October 11, 2020, when the pastor of our church preached on the same
First Reading and Responsorial</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we have today.  The priest spoke about what it means to
dwell in the House of the LORD.  It does not mean we move into the church
buildings and take up residence there. It means we live with the awareness that
we are in the presence of the LORD.  So our individual homes can be the House
of the LORD if we realize that GOD is with us there</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and in all other places we experience, and when we bring the
experience to others of the presence of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:     When I travel
through “dark valleys” (times of challenge), how much do I keep my eyes and
ears open to the GOoD Shepherd?  What am I doing, especially during Advent, to
give witness to the Reign of GOD that is “already, but not yet fully” here? 
How am I providing something that the Lord Jesus can use to multiple the gifts
of others and meet the needs of others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of compassion and generosity.
Through Your GOoDness, You desire that we share in the banquet feast You have
prepared for us.  Through Your Son You have shown us that Your Reign has begun
already, but is not yet fully experienced as it will be when Jesus comes
again.  Your Son, as the GOoD Shepherd, comes to us and leads us through the
dark valleys to a place of repose, beside restful streams. He begins to feed us
with not only our daily bread, but also with rich, sumptuous foods.  He
promises that His compassionate benevolence is only a small taste of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>what lies ahead for us if we continue to follow Him as He
leads us to You.  We have sometimes failed to recognize Your divine kindness. 
We have focused on the darkness in the valleys through which we travel.  We
seek Your continued guidance from Your Son and through the Holy Spirit’s
actions in our lives.  May we work for the ongoing spread of Your Reign among
us and look forward with joy and gratitude to the time when we will meet the
Coming Lord Jesus and be able to experience the fullness of Your Reign.  We make
this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, our Shepherd and
Provider, Who has come and Who will come again, and Who is already living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John Damascene:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-damascene</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 26: 1-6;          Psalm 118: 1 and 8-9,
19-21, 25-27a;          Matthew 7: 21, 24-27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We continue to look forward to the coming (adventus) of the
Reign of Heaven, that will be brought to its completion when the Lord Jesus
returns at the end of earthly time.  It is compared to a fortified city with
walls around it and with large, heavy gates through which will come all those
who are found worthy of entering.  Isaiah continues by describing the coming
Reign of the LORD as a strong city in which the lowly will be lifted above the
proud and haughty.  The psalm praises the One Who comes in the name of the
LORD.  This One will open the gates that will bring peace.  In the Gospel,
Jesus proclaims that more than mere words will make one eligible to enter the
Reign of GOD and one must build on the rock so as not to be overcome by storms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For those faithful, but lowly, believers of Isaiah’s time,
as well as our time, Isaiah’s words sound great.  They have had leaders who did
not lead.  They have seen their holy city attacked by their enemies. Isaiah
promises that GOD will re-establish the city of Jerusalem as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the city of peace and justice.  GOD will bring about a great
reversal of fortunes.  The well-to-do individuals will be knocked off their
pedestals and the lowly will take places of honor.  The Reign of GOD will bring
justice to those who have acted justly or who have been treated unjustly by
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s psalm speaks of One Who comes in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>name of the LORD.  This One will establish a Reign in which
peace, justice, salvation, and prosperity will rule.  It will be based on trust
in GOD and GOD alone, not in armies or human treaties or charismatic leaders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus has experienced too many people who
think they have it made in GOD’s Reign.  They have said the right words, they
have pretended to do the proper</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>thing.  Jesus remarks that it is only those who seek to do
GOD’s will and act upon Jesus’ words who will be part of the safe and strong
Reign of GOD.  More than merely formalistic phrases are needed.   Jesus uses
the analogy of a structure built on solid rock that can withstand the onrush of
powerful waters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The justice of GOD’s Reign comes through, loud and clear. 
Jesus has proclaimed the beginning of the Reign of GOD.  It will be marked by
the righting of past wrongs.  Those who have taken advantage of others will be
held accountable.  The disenfranchised and oppressed will be liberated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By His compassion, Jesus shows that He has begun the process
of lifting up the lowly (the Anawim) and bringing salus (healing, wholeness,
and salvation) to those seeking it.  The process will not be completed until
Jesus comes again.  In the meantime, we are to continue the work and ministry
of Jesus.  It is our participation in bringing about the just Reign of GOD that
will open the door for us to the fullness of Reign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I feel challenged by the readings.  Just mouthing the right
words is not enough to get me into the doors of heaven.  Even acknowledging
Jesus as Lord is not enough, if it is all mere words.  My heart
(decision-maker) and my actions must demonstrate that I want the justice of
GOD’s Reign to be active in the world.  I must do all I can </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to act with the justice of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does that mean practically for me? It means I must be
proactive in establishing justice in the areas in which I live and work.  A
practical example:  a few students at school were “jokingly” giving another
student a hard time.  I told them that I would not accept that type of
behavior.  They insisted, “We are only joking!”  I responded by saying that it
might be “joking” to them, but to the one who was the object of the “joke,” it
was a very unpleasant experience.  We must be willing to stand up for those who
are being oppressed, even in a “joking” way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way that I can help usher in the Reign of GOD’s
justice is by sharing with those who have less than I do.  It is the time of
year when we are asked to give to charity to help those who would otherwise not
be able to celebrate the joy of anniversary of Jesus’ birth.  It is appropriate
for us to be generous.  At a men’s Bible Study group one Advent, one of the
members shared how he and the other adult member of his family had agreed on
what sort of gifts they were going to give each other for Christmas.  Their
gifts were the performing of some sort of kindness/charity for someone who
would not be able to reciprocate the generosity.  On Christmas they would share
with the other adult members of their family what they had done during Advent
to act justly and lovingly to someone from whom they expected nothing in
return.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must be about the ushering in the Reign of GOD.  We show
that we are preparing the way for the Lord Jesus Christ by acting as He would –
reaching out compassionately, upholding justice, righting wrongs, giving hope
to those who are down.  It can be as simple as taking the time to show another
person that we are concerned for them.  We, as members of the “already, but not
yet” Reign of GOD, must bring the message of that Reign to others by the way we
treat them.  They should be able to experience GOD’s Reign in their lives by
the way we act toward them.  If we do this, then no matter how strong the winds
blow and the storm rages against us, we will be safe because we have built our
house on the Rock of GOD and we will be able to proclaim with today’s
psalmist:  “Give thanks to the LORD, for GOD is GOoD, for GOD’s mercy endures
forever.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  In what ways have I
given a false profession of faith in what reigns in my life? Do I only say that
I am part of the Reign of GOD with my words, but my actions and lifestyle
proclaim another realm to which I attach myself? How can I more pro-actively
proclaim the Reign of GOD alive in my life and in the lives of others?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all that is just and loving. 
Through Your GOoDness, You want all people to live in Your Reign where justice
and peace are the hallmarks.  By His teaching and ministry, Your Son, Jesus,
demonstrated Your compassion and care for those who were downtrodden.  Jesus
has commissioned us to continue the bringing about of Your Reign by doing as He
did.  At times we have let other selfish values reign in our lives.  We have
sought the lordship of fame and fortune.  We have ignored our fellow citizens
in Your Reign, especially those on the fringes of society.  For this we seek
Your pardon and forgiveness.  Continue to pour Your Holy Spirit into our lives
so that we will have the strength and conviction to live as heralds of Your
Reign.  May we make Your presence known by the way we treat those whom You have
placed in our paths.  We give You all the praise and glory as we continue our
journey toward the fullness of Your Reign of peace and justice.  We make this
prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, the One Who comes in
Your name and Who is already living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Friday of First Week of Advent Readings can be obtained
from:   http://usccb.org/bible/readings/120525.cfm St. Sabas:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-sabas</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 29: 17-24;         Psalm 27: 1, 4,
13-14;           Matthew 9: 27-31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Salvation is the theme that I see running through the
readings.  Salvation comes from the Latin salus or salvus and means “healing”
or “wholeness” or “salvation.”  The passage from Isaiah presents healing and
wholeness in physical images.  The psalm proclaims that the LORD GOD is
salvation.  In the Gospel, Jesus brings healing and wholeness to two blind men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through the prophet Isaiah, GOD promises great changes:  the
cedars will become trees that produce fruit, the blind will see, words on the
page will shout out, the lowly will rejoice, wrongs will be made right, and
most importantly, GOD’s chosen people will see GOD and praise the LORD for the
divine deeds done.  These are promises of healing and wholeness for all
creation and all creatures who seek GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist praises GOD as the source of salvation. Those
who wait for the coming (adventus) of GOD with patience and trust, will have
nothing to fear and they will be given signs of GOD’s saving graces:  light,
joy, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>great bounty.  Patience and courage is required as one waits
for the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, two blind individuals seek salus (healing)
from Jesus.  They cry out for Him to be compassionate.  Jesus heals them and
asks that they not spread the news of their healing to others.  Yet, their</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>excitement prevents them for keeping it</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>quiet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, particularly the Gospel, I
wondered about the mixed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>message of Jesus.  Jesus is moved to bring about salus
(healing) not because He wants to be famous, but because He truly cares and has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>compassion for those who are not whole (and/or not holy). 
At this point in His ministry, Jesus does not want His fame to spread because
that will lead to His being arrested and being put to death or His being
crowned as an earthly king.  He wants to reach out His healing hands and touch
people in a way that will draw them closer to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His Abba-Father.  He desires to bring a personal experience
of salvation to as many people as He can before His earthly life comes to an
end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus’ wish to keep His messiahship quiet is called the
“Messianic Secret” by some scripture scholars.  It is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not that Jesus does not want to bring salus to people, but
He does not want people to be enamored of His power and miss His message.  He
has come to usher in the Reign of GOD.  If people focus only on His miraculous
power, they will miss out on the healing and wholeness and holiness that He
wants them to have in all aspects of their lives.  Yes, Jesus has begun the
Reign of GOD, but the fullness of the Reign of GOD is not yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some ways, I am like children this time of year.  I
become anxious, not for presents on Christmas, but for the fulfillment of the
Reign of GOD.  I don’t want to have to struggle with earthly problems or have
to work at bringing about the Reign of GOD.  These past few years have been
challenging for all of us with the pandemic, natural disaster, political and
civil unrest, wars, etc.  Yet, part of the message I receive today is that I
have to be patient and wait.  Yes, I can be excited about what the Lord Jesus
has done and continues to do, but I should not get ahead of myself (or at least
not ahead of the Lord Jesus, except to prepare His way).  GOD is working in my
life and the lives of others.  Sometimes the Lord Jesus brings about an
immediate experience of salus and other times we have to wait for it to happen.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What do we do while we have to wait? We have to be patient. 
“Patient” come from the Latin word, patior, which meaning “to suffer.”  We have
to be willing to suffer a little until the Lord Jesus makes His final adventus
(“coming”) known.  Another English word that comes from the verb, patior, is
“passion” or “passionate.  It does not mean that we sit back and do nothing. 
It implies that we must be passionate about our belief in Jesus and His coming
(adventus) again.  We must be pro-actively involved in helping to prepare the
Way of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We must bring about the message of salvation by
compassionately reaching out to others as Jesus did.  We must be willing to
work, and pray, for the healing of mind, body, and soul of those who cry out to
the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I continue to reflect on what Jesus’ attitude was in healing
the blindness of the two individuals in the Gospel today.  He gave them sight
not to “wow” the people, but because He had compassion for them.  He realized
that they were not able to “see” the coming of the Lord Jesus until their
blindness was removed.  He wanted to make sure that they were ready for His
coming.  It seems like they did not fully “see” Jesus’ message.  Yes, they had
faith in Jesus, but they were so excited about their ability to see physically
that, at least for a time, they missed</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>out on the need to “see” spiritually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is our time of patient and  passionate waiting.  We
must wait for the final coming of the Lord Jesus.  We must be vigilant and 
patient, while pro-actively (passionately) spreading the message of the salus
of the Lord Jesus.  We must take the message of the psalmist seriously and
actively “wait for the LORD with courage; be stouthearted, and wait for the
LORD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What is my idea of
salvation?  How anxious am I to receive this gift from GOD?  Am I only
interested in physical aspects of salus – healing, wholeness – and not the
spiritual aspects – salvation and holiness? In what areas of my life do I need
to exercise more patience, and also be more passionate, as I wait for the Lord
Jesus’ return? How can I be more proactive (passionate) in helping others await
the Lord Jesus with courage?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD, GOD of all salus.  Through Your
GOoDness, You have always desired our wholeness and healing.  You alone know
what that fully means.  We often are misguided in our pursuit of wholeness.  We
think that if we are physically well or totally happy that we have Your gift of
salus.  Through Your Son, You remind us that what salvation really entails is
being able to dwell in Your presence and gaze on Your loveliness. Through the
power of Your Holy Spirit, give us the courage to be stouthearted and wait for
the fullness of the Coming (Adventus) of Your Son when He comes at the end of
time.  Help us to prepare the Way so that He can come to us and to others, and
so that He can lead us to You and we can proclaim You as our light and our
salvation.  We make this prayer in the name of Jesus, Your Son, our Brother and
Savior, Who has begun Your Reign, but Who will come again to bring us into the
fullness of Your Reign, where He now is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>December 6, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sat. of First Week of Advent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Optional Memorial of Saint Nicholas) Readings can be
obtained from:   http://usccb.org/bible/readings/120625.cfm Saint Nicholas:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-nicholas</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 30: 19-21, 23-26;        Psalm 147: 1-2,
3-4, 5-6;        Matthew 9: 35 – 10: 1, 5a, 6-8</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We continue to hear about the glories of the Reign of GOD. 
Isaiah’s word of prophecy proclaims a time when there will be abundant food,
peace, and joy.  The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for all that the LORD
does (and will do).  The response is a reminder that those who wait for the
LORD will be blessed.  In the Gospel, Jesus proclaims the Reign of Heaven/GOD,
yet He also expresses the need for people to be co-workers with Him in bringing
about the GOoD News of the Reign of Heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, Isaiah encourages the weary believers
with the words that promise that GOD will establish the divine rule and with
that will come a time of joy, truth, feasting, refreshment, and light.  When we
allow GOD to reign, life is always better.  For GOD is a GOD of compassion and
love for those who call out to heaven and to the One Who reigns there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In our Responsorial, GOD is glorified for the marvelous
deeds that the LORD has done</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and will do.  Some of the reasons GOD is to be praised is
the rebuilding of Jerusalem, the gathering of the dispersed believers back in
the Holy City, the healing of the sick and disabled, the control of the
universe including stars, and the righting of wrongs done by evil doers.  The
refrain used between the stanzas reiterates the theme of Advent:  “Blessed are
those who wait for the Lord.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus continues His ministry of announcing
the coming Reign of Heaven.  It has begun through His uplifting words and
compassionate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>works, but GOD has willed that it will not be fully
experienced during Jesus’ earthly life, nor probably during our earthly life. 
It will only reach its climax when Jesus returns.  Therefore, Jesus seeks
fellow laborers to help with the harvesting of the fruits of the Reign of GOD. 
Jesus empowers His disciples with the authority to do what He has done:  preach
the GOoD News in both word and action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once again, we are reminded that Jesus has come to usher in
the Reign of GOD.  His first coming (adventus) was the beginning of His Reign. 
The completion of GOD’s Reign will not be until Jesus comes again.  In the
meantime, Jesus has entrusted His ministry to His disciples.  Not only are the
ordained clergy and the paid church employees called to work for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>expansion of the Reign of Heaven, but also all who are
followers of Jesus must be about His ministry.  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>harvest is truly huge.  Yet those who are committed to the
spread of the heavenly Reign are few in comparison. There is still a lot of
work to be done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through my work in Stephen Ministry and other ministries, I
realize how many people are in need of help and of the reassurance of GOD’s
Reign.  Their primary need is for someone to have compassion for them and be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>there with them.  They are, to use Jesus’ words, like sheep
without a shepherd.  They are so burdened that they cannot know which way to go
in order to be a part of GOD’s Reign.  For some, they cannot experience GOD’s
loving care until they are touched by some human hands that show love and
concern for them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more we are willing to work for the furthering of the
Reign of GOD, the more we will be a part of it.  I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>am reminded of Saint (Mother) Teresa of Calcutta.  She
realized GOD’s power when she ministered to the sick, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the dying, and the outcasts.  She did not care if people
were Christian or not, she saw their pain and suffering. She knew that she
could help bring about the Reign of GOD by her serving the poor and helpless. 
The more she ministered, the more she was aware of what the Reign of Heaven was
all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Advent journey, we are called to wait for
the Lord Jesus’ coming (Adventus).  Waiting, however, does not mean doing
nothing.  Waiting requires us to be pro-active in hastening Jesus’ coming.  We
must be preparing the Way for the Lord Jesus.  We are called to be co-workers
in the harvest.  The sooner the harvest is completed, the sooner we will be
able to share in the final fruits of the harvest.  It is then that we will
experience the fullness of GOD’s Reign as described in the readings:  no more
tears or suffering, a time of peace, abundant food and drink, the joy of being
in the Light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD has chosen to need our help.  We are being called to be
active in the bringing about the Reign of GOD. We all have a share.  The more
we work, and work together, the greater will be our joy as we wait for the Lord
Jesus’ final coming.  Blessed are those who actively wait for the Lord Jesus!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think about
the harvest of GOD being huge and the laborers being few, what thoughts go
through my mind? Do I see myself in need of GOD’s laborers?  Do I sense that I
am being called to be a co-worker in GOD’s field and help bring the Reign of
GOD to others?  In what way can I further the Reign of GOD today? To whom can I
minister so that they do not feel quite so alone and lacking in direction?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, divine Lover and compassionate
LORD.  Through Your GOoDness, You care for all people, especially those who cry
out to You.  You want all to experience Your reigning in their lives.  You</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have sent Your Son, Jesus, to usher in Your heavenly Reign. 
Jesus proclaimed Your love and compassion, not only in His words, but also in
His reaching out and touching those who seemed to be wandering aimlessly
without direction or those who were disabled from journeying along the Way to Your
Reign.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, Jesus continues His
compassionate and loving ministry by calling others to do as He did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We who call ourselves His disciples are asked to assist in
harvesting people into the Reign of Heaven.  We have sometimes failed in our
calling by choosing other paths or making excuses why we cannot serve.  We ask
for Your forgiveness and healing.  Continue to pour forth Your Holy Spirit, so
that we will courageously and lovingly work in the fields that Your Son has started. 
Give us the strength and wisdom and compassion so that we can touch lives like
our Master-Teacher, and for our Master-Teacher.  We make this prayer in His
name, Jesus, Your Son and our Brother, Who works in and through us, and
continues to lead us to the fullness of Your Reign, where He is now living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second Sunday of Advent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Ambrose:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-ambrose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:             Isaiah 11: 1-10; Psalm 72: 1-2, 7-8,
12-13, 17;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Romans 15: 4-9;               Matthew 3:
1-12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Advent journey continues.  We see two different images
of the Coming Reign of GOD.  Both are true; both can speak to us.  Isaiah
speaks of a time when the Chosen One of GOD will come and issue in a time of
peace and mutually cooperation.  The Responsorial Psalm declares a time when
peace and justice flourish.  Paul urges the Roman Christians to manifest the
unity to which GOD is calling them, in and through Jesus.  The Gospel presents
John the Baptist’s ministry of preparing people for the Coming of the One Who
is mightier than he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah sees a profound period of peace as the Chosen One of
GOD comes. His Coming (“advent”) will be marked by the gifts that come from the
Spirit of GOD:  wisdom, understanding, counsel, strength, knowledge, and fear
(awe) of the LORD.  The Chosen One will come in judgment, not based on
appearances, but with justice and peace.  A sign of the justice and peace are
given in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>images of new life sprouting from barren branches; and
animals that are normally enemies of each other, now eating together.  It will
be life totally different from that experienced presently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist looks forward to GOD’s blessing of the Coming
Ruler of the people Who will establish a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reign of true peace and justice.  This Coming Regent will
reach out to the poor and the disenfranchised and save them.  All peoples of
the world will be blessed by the One Who will come soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In his letter to the faithful of Rome, Paul points out that
all Hebrew scriptures refer to the Messiah as the fulfillment of all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>promises proclaimed about the One Who was to come.  Jesus
fits the description of Messiah fully.  In and through Jesus, all are to be
one. Thus, Paul exhorts the faithful to work for, and live in, the unity that
Jesus’s First Coming began, and that will be completed by His Second Coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel gives another image of the Coming Reign of God. 
It speaks of judgment of those who have not reformed their lives; they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will face fire, wrath, and an ax.  John the Baptist is a
voice crying out in the desert.  His voice is one of warning.  He calls the
people to repentance, in Greek, μετανοια - metanoia.  Metanoia means a change
of direction, a change of heart and mind.  It requires people to change their
lives and open their hearts to the One Who is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These two images of the Advent (“Coming”) of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lord Jesus seem to contradict each other.  Yet, if we look</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>closer, they are linked together.  John the Baptist is
preparing others for the Coming.  He wants people to be ready when the Coming
One arrives.  The way they do this is by reviewing their lives and seeing what
is out of line with vision presented by Isaiah.  John calls for metanoia,
particularly for those who are not living lives </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>marked by the gifts of the Spirit.  If people are not acting
with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and fear (being in awe) of the Lord,
then they better shape up or they will be shipped out to the ax, fire, and
wrath.  John says he is not the One Who is to come, he is only the pre-cursor
(the one who runs in front) to clear the path for the One Who is Coming.  He
promises the Advent (“Coming”) One will establish a reign that will be
different. The waiting people, who are prepared and ready, will receive new
life and joy, and will peacefully co-exist with their former foes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what is the message for us? Simply put, and borrowing the
motto of the American Coast Guard, “Semper Paratus – Always Prepared – Always
Ready.” The members of the Coast Guard know that the Latin phrase is more than
a state of mind or a catchy motto.  It takes discipline, changing their way of
life, exercising and training, and practice.  It means living a style of life
that reflects that they are ready for whatever might happen.  For us who are
waiting for the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus, it means discipline also.  We
must be disciplined learners of the Lord Jesus (disciples of the
Master-Teacher).  It means we may have to look at our lives and to change any
aspects that do not fit the Gospel message.  It means metanoia.  Our training
consists in spiritual activities and charitable exercises.  We have to practice
the peace, understanding, unity,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and way of life that will mark the Reign of God when the
Coming One appears</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>again.   It means modeling a life that proclaims the peace
and justice of God. Advent is a time for getting ready.  It is the Christian
boot camp.  We are being prepared to go out and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>remove any obstacles hindering the path of the Coming Lord. 
Our lives should never be the same again.  Once a disciplined follower of the
Lord Jesus, one should always be a disciplined follower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are you ready?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When I think about
the Coming of the Lord Jesus, how prepared am I? Am I “always” prepared?  Do I
keep my mind on the fact that I must be ready at all times?  What discipline(s)
must I practice in order to be “Always Prepared” for the Lord Jesus’ Coming? 
What practical things can I do to work for the peace, justice, and unity of the
Reign of the One W ho has come and is Coming again?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, provider of all that is needed. 
Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son as the One Who Comes in Your
name.  He has walked among us announcing Your GOoD News.  Like the people of
His days, many people today are not prepared or ready for His Coming.  We find
ourselves too engrossed in the ways of the world and failing to discipline
ourselves so that we will always be prepared for His Coming again.  For our
failure to prepare and for our sins against peace, justice, and unity, we seek
Your pardon and forgiveness.  With the continued prompting of the Holy Spirit,
motivate us to metanoia – change of heart.  Strength us to discipline ourselves
to always be ready and prepared.  We make this prayer in the name of the One
Who has come and is Coming again, Jesus, our Master-Teacher and Savior, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Immaculate Conception: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/immaculate-conception-of-the-blessed-virgin-mary</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Genesis 3: 9-15, 20;      Psalm 98: 1, 2-3,
3-4;     Ephesians 1: 3-6, 11-12;      Luke 1: 26-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings present us with two women, their actions,
and the repercussions of their actions.  We have a contrast today between Eve
and Mary.   Both women are key to the message of salvation, but from opposite
perspectives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, as we explore the story of the fall from
grace in the Garden of Eden, we see some interesting events taking place.  GOD
has graced Adam and Eve with a beautiful place to live, no problems, plenty of
food – a true paradise.  Then enters the tempter, the serpent, identified often
as Satan, the fallen angel.  There is the temptation to eat of something that
seems “good,” even though GOD command that it not be eaten.  The woman eats and
invites her mate to join her. Both realize their shame – they can no longer be
freely open with themselves, or with GOD.  They have the first recorded
“cover-up” in “history.”  When challenged by GOD, they do not want to admit
their own part in the offense, but they try to blame some else:  Adam blames
Eve and GOD, Eve blames the serpent.  A story that reflects the truth of the
human condition: GOD graces us, we chose to go our own way; when confronted, we
try to shift the blame onto others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My reflection led me to think back at what my perceptions of
sin and grace had been.  As a youngster, I used to think that we earned grace
when we obeyed, and we lost grace when we sinned.  Grace, in this sense, was
our reward for doing right.  Yet, that perception, I think, was a
misunderstanding on my part.  Grace, by its very definition, means a gift. 
Grace is a gift from GOD, or better yet, the gift of GOD.  It is GOD choosing
to share the divine life with us.  What we do with the grace is what is
important.  If we accept the grace, then we will want to obey.  If we do not
accept the grace, we will disobey.  Grace is not the reward of obedience;
obedience is the response to grace in our life.  (Obedience by the way comes
from the Latin for “hearing and responding.” Thus, disobedience is not
listening and not responding, at least not responding properly.) And the more
we “obey” GOD, the more GOD shares the divine life with us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adam and Eve were blessed with grace.  They chose not to
fully accept the grace.  They wanted something of their own choice. The
rejected grace, the life of GOD with them; thus, they disobeyed – they sinned. 
They hid from GOD because they were afraid because they had rejected GOD’s
grace, GOD’s gift of divine life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet GOD did not abandon them.  GOD promised that through the
offspring of the woman, the battle between GOoD and evil would be fought and GOoD
would ultimately win.  It would be a horrific battle. The offspring of the
woman would be injured in the fight, but the offspring of the woman would be
victorious over the offspring of the serpent (evil).  People would again accept
the gift of GOD’s grace, offered by the offspring of the woman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel leads us to the woman from whom the Promised One
would come.  Mary is gifted with grace.  GOD gives her an abundance of grace.
The Angel Gabriel addresses her with greeting, “full of grace.”  And she responds
with her “fiat” – “let it be.”  She freely chooses to accept GOD’s grace, GOD’s
life within in her.  In a sense she was offered the best grace, GOD’s life
incarnate within her womb.  This was a huge request that GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>asked of her; the request came with a lot of repercussions.
This would change her life (and also the life of all people).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To give us some idea of how big an invitation this was, we
need to understand a few things.  Jewish woman took the promise offered by GOD
in Genesis 3 seriously. They wanted to become the woman from whom would come
the Offspring – the Messiah – Who would become victorious over the serpent.
They wanted to become the mother of this Messiah.  This was something that was
desired by most Israelite woman.  Yet some church tradition says that Mary, as
a young girl, had made a vow not to have children.  Why she made this vow is
not clearly understood. There were some Jewish girls who gave up their hope of
ever becoming the mother of the Messiah.  Yes, she would have a husband, since
a Jewish woman needed a man for her protection under the law.  She, however,
would remain a virgin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As today’s Gospel takes place, she is already betrothed to
Joseph, but they are not yet married nor are they living under the same roof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the messenger (angel) of GOD appears to Mary, she is
perplexed.  The angel shares GOD’s invitation of grace.  GOD wants Mary to
accept GOD’s life within her so that GOD can become incarnate in and through
her.  She is asked to be the mother of the Messiah.  Many things probably raced
through her mind.  How was this going to happen? What about her promise of
virginity? The angel reassures her of GOD’s gift of grace.  She is told it will
be by the power of the Holy Spirit that she will conceive and give birth to the
One Who will be called “Son of the Most High.”  More questions probably ran
through her mind:  if she becomes pregnant and it is not by Joseph, Joseph will
know, and by Jewish law, he has both a right and an obligation to have her
stoned.  How will she explain this? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary is willing to accept this grace, the gift of GOD’s life
becoming human in and through her.  She doesn’t reject the gift.  She listens
as the angel explains a little more of GOD’s plan.  She is shown how GOD can
work things out, since GOD has allowed Elizabeth, her elderly relative, to be
with child.  The angel assures her that with GOD, all things are possible.  She
is confident (a word that means “with faith”) that GOD will see her through
(providere), if she but listens and responds (“obeys”).  She responds to GOD’s
grace, GOD’s gift of the fullness of GOD’s life within her.  She obediently
says, “fiat” – “let it be.”  Her obedience leads to the birth of the One Who
would counteract the disobedience of Adam and Eve, and all other acts of disobedience
since.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So how does that fit in with today’s Solemnity of the
Immaculate Conception? Today we celebrate that Mary was conceived in the womb
of her mother (Anne - Hannah) without the sin with which all other humans are
conceived.   This was the beginning of Mary’s grace, the gift of GOD’s life
within her. St. Paul, in today’s letter to the Ephesians, speaks about GOD’s
plan and GOD’s foreknowledge. GOD always knows what will happen.  GOD has
always known that Mary would accept this special grace. Thus, Mary was allowed
to receive the grace of redemption that her Son would bring through His death
and resurrection. She received this gift before the act of redemption took
place in time.  It was something GOD the Abba-Father knew would happen.  Mary was
just graced with the gift before it took place.  And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>how fitting it is that GOD would prepare a human place, free
of sin, in which the Son of GOD would take human form.  And is not GOD free to
grace people in GOD’s own way? Cannot GOD give the gift of redemption (that is
the full sharing of GOD’s life with people) to one who would fully say “yes” to
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gift later in her life? Remember as the angel said in
today’s gospel, “for nothing is impossible with GOD.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How does all this “theologizing” have an effect on my daily
life?  GOoD question. It does not mean that Mary is fourth person of the
blessed “quadrinity.” Mary is not GOD.  Mary is only human.  Yet she is the
best role model of what it means to be a graced human.  She gives us the best
example of one who accepts the invitation of GOD’s grace.  She so obediently
responded to GOD’s offer of divine life, that GOD became incarnate within her. 
She brought forth the Word of GOD in human form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Catholics are often accused of “praying” to Mary in the
sense of making her divine.  Yet, if we truly look at our prayers, they are
asking (beseeching and in the English sense of the word “praying”) that Mary
would intercede for us.  In Catholic prayers, we use the phrase “pray for us”
whenever we want others to join with us in prayer.  Thus, it is that we often
ask friends to pray for us.  Most</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>often when we ask someone to pray for us, we often ask those
whom we know are trying to live a GOD-centered life.  Why not ask the woman who
exemplifies what it means to have a GOD-centered life?  We ask Mary to join our
prayer and adoration of the GOD Who graces us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In conclusion, what am I going to do differently today in my
Advent journey? First of all, I am going to thank GOD for the grace that is
continually offered to me.  I am going to be grateful that GOD wants to share
the divine life with me.  I am going to respond to the gift of grace by living
a life of grace, a graceful life, a life filled with GOD’s life.  I will
respond to GOD’s invitation with my own “fiat” – “let it be.”  That means I am
consciously going to look at my life and see what in my life is not reflecting
the fact that GOD is within me and also see what sinfulness and disobedience is
there within me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, it means I am going to turn to those presently on earth
living a life of grace and those who are living the fullness of life of grace
in heaven and ask them (beseech, pray) that they join me in praying to
(worshiping, adoring) our GOD as a part of my response to the gift of grace
that GOD alone gives me.  I will ask them to join me in adoring, thanking, and
petitioning GOD.  And I will thank GOD especially for the example of the woman
who said the greatest “yes” to GOD and in whom GOD Incarnate took on flesh and
from whom He was born.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: How have I thought
of grace? Why was Mary addressed as “full of grace”?   Do I sometimes limit
GOD’s grace by my own (sinful) thoughts and actions? To what aspects of my life
do I need to respond to GOD’s invitation by saying “Fiat – Let it be”? How can
I help others realize that GOD wants them to receive the divine gift of grace?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all grace.  Through Your
GOoDness we are given the opportunity to respond to the gift of Your life
within us.  We thank You for using the “fault” of Adam and Eve, so that the
promise of Your grace could be born in Mary, the new Eve.  For without sin,
there would not have been the need of redemption by Your Son, Jesus.  Thank You
for choosing Mary and allowing her to respond to Your invitation of grace and
Your life within in her.  Jesus, Your ever-living Son, took human existence in
Mary.  May we continued to say with her, “Let it be done to me as You say.”  We
make this prayer of praise and thanks to You, in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the name of Your Son, Jesus, the Word made flesh, the only
Savior and Redeemer, our Brother, Who was born of the Virgin Mary, has died for
us, is risen, and is now living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our
one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 40: 1-11;       Psalm 96: 1-2, 3 and 10ac,
11-12, 13;        Matthew 18: 12-14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings continue the Advent theme of preparing for
the Coming Day of the Lord Jesus.  The First Reading has been linked to John
the Baptist.  All of readings are also filled with hope at the Coming (Advent)
of our saving GOD.  Not only should we be filled with hope, but we should also
praise and thank GOD (psalm) for GOD’s willingness to go out in search of the
wayward (Gospel).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah reassures the exiles that GOD will come and lead them
along a straight and broadened highway, back to the Land of Promise.  Even
though the people are no more than grass and flowers that wither and die, GOD
takes an interest in them, more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>than a shepherd cares for the sheep. This should lead to all
the cities of GOD (and all their inhabitants now and in the future) praising
GOD for GOD’s benevolence and caring.  GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>chosen ones should want to joyously and loudly proclaim
GOD’s praise, especially as GOD tends the divine flock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm urges all of GOD’s people to rejoice and sing
praise to the LORD, because the LORD is keeping the promise of “Coming”
(Advent) to the people in order to save them.  When the Reign of GOD is
established, justice and constancy will be evident.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus explains that GOD has more joy when the
wayward turn back to GOD than when faithful “sheep” stay where they should be. 
GOD wants all to turn back (metanoia) to the Lord Jesus and be saved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I recall the passage of 2
Peter 3: 8-14.  We may be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anxious that the Lord Jesus will come again, especially if
we are going through some rough times.  We, like Peter and Paul, may at times
be baffled because the Lord Jesus has not come back yet.  Yet, Peter reassures
us, the Lord Jesus is not delaying.  GOD is just giving more people a little
more time to turn back (metanoia).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am truly humbled that GOD cares enough about me</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(and everyone else) that the Lord Jesus is waiting to come
until I (and the rest of us) get back on track.  GOD wants us to be a part of
the heavenly Reign.  GOD wants us to enjoy the divine presence more than we may
want it ourselves. GOD keeps giving us more chances.  When will we run out of
chances? I don’t know.  So, we better be prepared now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of my nieces was working on a film script.  She had
written many versions of it and submitted it to the producers. Often they would
send it back and say, “Re-write this part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It isn’t right.”  And she re-worked the script and re-
submitted it to the producers who sometimes remark, “Better, but it still needs
a little work in parts.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is like that.  GOD gives us the starting script for our
lives and wants us to finish writing the script.  GOD </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>frequently looks at the script of our life and says, “It
isn’t right.  Re-do this section.”  We then can re-think how our life is being
portrayed and see if it is up to the standards GOD wants.  We again turn it
over to GOD and often GOD responds, “Better, but it still needs more work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is overwhelming to me that GOD loves us so much.  Our
response to GOD’s great love should be obedience and praise and willingness to
re-work our life-script to be more inline with what the Lord Jesus wants for
us.  We should give thanks to the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father for that
abundant mercy, compassion, and love.  It is no wonder that the psalmist
expresses for us what our attitude should be:  “Sing to the LORD a new song;
sing to the LORD, all you lands.  Sing to the LORD; bless GOD’s name; announce
GOD’s salvation, day after day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Advent journey, let us take the time to
appreciate GOD’s infinite love for us.  Let us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflect on what parts of our life may need to be re-worked
so that it fulfills GOD’s thoughts and desires for us. May we be bearers of the
GOoD News of GOD’s compassion to others through our actions and words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   When have I
experienced GOD’s gracious caring for me, especially when I have strayed away
from GOD’s will? What has been my response to GOD’s searching me out and giving
me another chance to re-work the life- script I have? How can I help reach out
to others who are wayward and remind them of the graciousness and love of our
GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD and our loving Abba.  Through Your
GOoDness, You care for us so much that You have gone out in search of us, just
as a shepherd searches for a lost sheep.  The sending of Your Son as the Good
Shepherd reminds us of Your taking a liking to us.  You have gone to the
extreme in allowing Jesus to be born a human, to live and minister here on
earth, to heal and restore people to salus (healing, wholeness, holiness,
salvation), and to give the highest example of love through His own ministry,
death, and resurrection. Help us to see how our wandering away from You is so
sinful, not because it leads to our own demise, but because it is an affront to
Your graciousness.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, open our minds to
Your immense love.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, the
GOoD Shepherd, Who continues to come after us and lead us back to You.  It is
from Him that we have redemption, grace, and salvation.  It is He Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Adolf Kopling: 
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-adolph-kolping</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 40: 25-31;          Psalm 103: 1-2, 3-4, 8
and 10;          Matthew 11: 28-30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a passage in Nehemiah that says, “The joy of the
LORD is my strength” (8: 10).  Today’s reading could be summarized in a play on
those words:  “The strength of the LORD is my joy.”  Isaiah speaks of the
strength of the LORD GOD.  Not only does GOD have strength, GOD shares that
strength with those who ask for it.  Although the word “strength” does not
appear in today’s psalm, the psalm presents some of the results of GOD’s
strength:  pardon, forgiveness, redemption, and compassion.  In the Gospel
today, Jesus promises His disciples that He will lighten their load and take
their burdens upon Himself for He is strong and able to handle the load.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The exiles to whom Isaiah addresses his words were under a
tremendous burden, not just physically, but also emotionally and spiritually,
as they suffered as exiles in Babylon.  They needed to be given encouragement
and hope.  Isaiah portrays the LORD GOD as the unmatchable Force Who can win
any battle.  Not only is GOD strong, but also the LORD shares the divine
strength with those who are weak and weary.  GOD empowers them to soar like
eagles (with lifted spirits) and run and not grow faint or weary.  GOD is the
source of strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm presents the proper response to a GOD Who is
strong enough to forgive, redeem, and have compassion on the broken people. 
The response is to berakah (bless, praise, give glory to) GOD.  What great joy
should fill those who have been touched by the strong hand of the LORD GOD that
is being extended to all who are open to GOD!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, the ever-compassionate Christ Jesus looks
upon His disciples</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and sees that they are worn out and exhausted.  He promises
them relief and rest.  All they need to do is allow themselves to be yoked to
Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A yoke is a frame that is attached to two or more animals so
that they can work together to bear a heavy burden.  It is a well-established
tool used in order to make effective power of couple of strong creatures.  The
beasts of burden share the load and work as a team.  Jesus asks that we join
with Him and work as a team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our heavy burdens, that we could not bear by ourselves, can
be eased if we just allow the Lord Jesus to take the heaviest part of the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some of us, one of the problems in being yoked is that
we think we lose our independence.  We have the misconception that if we become
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>linked with another, even if that “Other” is Jesus, then we
cannot do our own thing.  That is why a lot people refuse to be yoked with
Jesus.  There</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yoke_(PSF).png </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is no way they can pull their burden, but they will not give
up their supposed freedom to do what they want to do.  They would rather die
from exhaustion than give up doing it their own way.  I am reminded of the song
written by Paul Anka that Frank Sinatra sang, I Did It My Way.  That is not
Biblical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus promises to be our strength.  The results will be a
lighter burden for us, and a little time to rest from the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>heavy workload.  The work can be done more effectively and
efficiently.  And, in reality, we are assured of being on the right path
because the One with Whom we are linked knows the path we should take and has
traveled the way before us, in fact, He is the Way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we move through this Advent season and as we think about
all the work we must do at our places of employment, or school, and/or at home
to finish all of our deadlines before the end of the year or before taking a </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>break for Christmas or being able to celebrate with family
and friends in the way we think it should be, we may think we can never do it. 
We may also be weakened by colds or the flu, or even a virus.  Even the change
in weather can affect us.  “How are we going to get through the next week and
half?” we may ask ourselves.  The answer is, “very difficultly,” if we do not
allow ourselves to be yoked up with Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To be yoked with Jesus does not mean that we give up our
freedom nor does it mean we can sit back and do nothing, expecting Jesus to do
all the work.  We still have choices to make and work to do, but we do not have
to do it alone.  We can trust that Jesus will see us through.  To be yoked up
with Jesus means we take time to be with Him, reflecting on His words, learning
from Him Who is the Master-Teacher – after all.  Today He says, “Learn from
Me.”  It means we must be disciples of the Lord Jesus – disciplined learners
who are willing to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>follow the routine set up by the Master.  It means a lot of
work on our part, but we have the guidance and help of the One Who has come
through it all before us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And as we allow ourselves to be yoked with Jesus, we will
notice how much easier it is for us.  We can then appropriately say that “the
strength of the Lord Jesus is our joy.”  We will be moved to give praise and
glory to the Lord Jesus Christ and to His heavenly Abba-Father.  We will say,
in the paraphrased words of today’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Responsorial Psalm, “Bless the LORD, O my soul; and all my
being, bless GOD’s holy name.  Bless the LORD, O my</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>soul, and forget not all GOD’s benefits.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: When I think of being
yoked to Jesus, what are my thoughts and feelings?   Is there anything that
prevents me from surrendering my burden to the Lord Jesus and asking Him to
lighten my load? Is there some way that I can join with the Lord Jesus in
helping others who are overburdened and need relief?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all compassion.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continue to be our ever compassionate and caring Abba-Father. 
You do not want us, Your children, to be overly-burden to the point that we
lose hope and faith in You.  For this reason, You sent Your Son, Christ Jesus,
to be not only our Savior, but our Master-Teacher, and the One Who is willing
to help carry our heavy loads.  He has come to bring us relief and rest, if we
but allow Him into our lives.  We must be willing to give up a little of our
independence in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>order to be yoked with Him.  Yet, Your Son, our loving
Master-Teacher, promises to teach us what we need to do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in order to get through the exhausting moments in our
lives.  Not only does He teach us, but also, He willingly bears the brunt of
the burden so that we can find the refreshment and strength to continue along
the path to You.  For the times we have taken too much upon ourselves without
trusting in Jesus, our Master-Teacher, we ask for Your pardon and forgiveness. 
For the times we have not given ourselves over to the wisdom, guidance, and
strength of Your Son, we beg Your understanding and compassion.  For the times
Your Son has pulled us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and our burdens to the safety and place of rest and renewal,
we give You thanks and praise.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit helps us
never forget all of Your benefits.  We make this prayer of praise and
thanksgiving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the name of Christ Jesus, Your Son and our
Master-Teacher, the One Who invites us to allow Him to be yoked with us.  He it
is Who teaches us the paths to rest and refreshment.  He it is Who journeys
along with us, but Who is also living and reigning with You and the Holy
Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>December 11, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thursday of the Second Week of Advent</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Opt. Mem. of St. Damasus I) Readings can be obtained
from:   http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/121125.cfm Saint Damasus I:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-damasus-i</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 41: 13-20;         Psalm 145: 1, 9, 10-11,
12-13ab;         Matthew 11: 11-15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a phrase that is repeated twice in the first verses
of today’s selection from Isaiah.  It is “Do not fear” or “Do not be afraid.” 
This phrase is repeated at least 365 times throughout the Bible.  And at the
same time another phrase that repeats itself in scripture is “Fear the LORD.”  
How are these phrases reconciled with each other? And what does that have to do
with the rest of the readings today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Fear of the LORD” or “Awe of GOD” means acknowledging the
LORD for Who the LORD is:  The LORD is the faithful and just GOD.  It means
reverencing GOD for Who GOD is.  It is part of our prayer of Adoration.  It is
also part of our prayer of Contrition, for we also acknowledge that we are
sinners and in need of GOD’s grace and salvation.  “Fear of the LORD” is being
in right relationship with a GOD Who loves and challenges us, a GOD Who
comforts us when we cry to GOD for help, and a GOD Who expects more of us when
we are not living up to our full potential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the selection from Isaiah GOD is speaking the other words
to us, “Fear not. . .Do not be afraid.”  GOD wants to reassure us that the LORD
is in control and GOD will right all the wrongs and will restore life to those
from whom it has been taken.  The imagery of the desert rocks being sources of
water and of the dry and barren land blooming with new growth would be
comforting images to people who were experiencing dry times during a time of exile
and oppression.  The outcasts and poor (the “Anawim”) will be restored and
lifted up to not only their past high point, but even higher.  This is a
message of comfort for people who have experienced nothing but hardships.  They
were at the point of despair.  Their lives were filled with fear:  “What else
will happen to us? Will our enemies destroy us further?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people are asking similar questions during our present
era.  Some people have seen their “retirement” go down the financial sewer. 
Others who have heard and believe the messages of doom about the collapse of
the United States and end of the world.  The pandemic, social and political
unrest, war in parts of the world, senseless shootings at cars and people in
schools, stores, and at supposedly happy celebrations, natural disasters of
hurricanes and fires makes us fearful and unsure of what will happen next.  Our
lives are filled with fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is speaking through Isaiah to the Jewish people some
2550 years ago.  GOD’s message is also being proclaimed to us:  “Do not be
afraid.” Fear can be destructive.  Fear takes away our ability to love.  St.
John in his first letter speaks of this.  1 John 4: 18 says:  “There is no fear
in love, for perfect love casts out fear.”  Fear and love are opposites.  If we
love and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>sense that we are loved, we will not fear.  If we are
fearful, we are not able to fully love or to be loved fully.  That is because
fear puts us on the defense, it prevents us from trusting.  When we are
“fear-full,” we are controlled by the unknown lack of control, rather than
realizing that GOD is in control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfounded fear is debilitating.  It takes all our energy and
channels it in unproductive worry.  Fear is often a bunch of lies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is reminding us today that we should allow GOD’s own
divine life and love control our life.  It will set us free; it will be the
refreshing water in our arid lives.  GOD is comforting us and giving us hope. 
GOD asks us to trust in the Lord Jesus and believe that He will take care of
us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today we hear Jesus speaking about John the
Baptist and the Coming (Advent) of the Reign of GOD.  John is praised for
preparing people to hear the message of the Coming Reign of GOD.  And Jesus
also mentions those who are of the Reign of GOD will be greater than John the
Baptist.  In a sense, Jesus is saying </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that John came before the establishment of the Reign of
GOD.  He is part of the Old Testament line of prophets.  Things are different
once the Reign of GOD begins.  The Reign of GOD has met (and continues to meet)
opposition, Jesus informs His disciples.  The Reign of GOD, however, will
ultimately win out.  This is a reminder to us:  following Jesus can be
challenging, but ultimately rewarding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on these readings, a saying of one of my
spiritual directors hits me.  I once asked this priest-spiritual director,
“What would you like written on your tombstone?”  He thought for a while and
responded, “I would like the phrase ‘He comforted the disturbed, and disturbed
the comfortable.’”  I was struck by that phrase because that is what GOD is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>doing with us and what we should do in our daily lives with
others.   We should proclaim comfort, hope, and “Fear not” to those who are
disturbed, outcast, and upset.  And we can proclaim those messages not just in
words, but in actions.  (Remember what St. Francis of Assisi said to his
followers:  “Proclaim the GOoD News at all times. . .and, if necessary, use
words.”)  We need to be people of comfort and peace, people who live lives
without fear, people enveloped with the love of GOD, so that those who need to
hear that GOoD News message will be able to see it and hear it in us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And at the same time we are called to live lives that
challenge those who are too comfortable in their complacent lives.  We need to
be sources of loving confrontation to those who follow a message contrary to
the Gospel - GOoD News of Jesus.  Again, our actions need to speak louder than
our words.  Others should be able to sense our opposition to their complacency
by our behavior that is in contrast to their lives of complacency to the
Truth.  We must live exemplary lives – lives of example – that we are people of
the Reign of GOD.  The very way we live should challenge others to live better
and holier lives than they are living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only way we will be able to comfort the disturb and
disturb the comfortable is by spending time with the Lord Jesus and honestly
and humbly looking at our lives and asking GOD to comfort those areas in our
lives that are disturbed and disturb the areas of our lives that are complacent
in sinfulness.  We have to come to learn from the Master what areas of our
lives need to be changed so that we can proclaim the GOoD News of Jesus at all
times.  In doing so we will be joining the psalmist in the today’s words, “Let
all Your works give You thanks, O LORD, and let Your faithful ones bless You.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What fears are
keeping me from fully loving GOD, others, and myself?   In what areas of my
life do I need to experience GOD's comfort?  In what areas of my life do I need
to be challenged to do more?  How can I comfort the disturbed and disturb the
comfortable today?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all peoples.  Through Your
GOoDness, You sent Your Son, Jesus, to earth to proclaim the GOoD News of Your
love.  He proclaimed it by His life and His words.  Your Son spoke messages of
comfort and healing to those who were afflicted spiritually, physically, and
mentally.  He challenged those who were not living up to the potential that You
had set for them.  May we learn from Him, Who is gentle and humble of heart. 
May our lives reflect that Jesus is our Master-Teacher and Lord.  Take away the
fear that prevents us from loving ourselves, others, and You.  Give us the
wisdom and strength to proclaim Your GOoD News to others, especially in the way
we treat them.  Strengthen us so that we can firmly, but lovingly, challenge
ourselves and others to rise above complacency and live up to the level You
expect of us.  We make this prayer</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our Savior and Redeemer, Who
has died, is risen, and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Mary Frances Schervier:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-mary-frances-schervier</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Isaiah 48: 17-19;         Psalm 1: 1-2, 3, 4,
6;           Matthew 11: 16-19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Advent journey, we reflect on the idea
that those who follow the Lord Jesus will produce a rich harvest.  GOD, through
the words of Isaiah, promises to reward and bless those who have been willing
to walk in GOD’s way.  The psalmist today compares those who do GOD’s will to a
tree that is planted near the source of life-giving water.  Growth and GOoD
fruit are produced by trees that are nourished by the vivifying </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(life giving) stream.  In the Gospel, Jesus admits that some
people criticize those who do GOoD and the critics will find any excuse to do
so; while those who seek to help others will be rewarded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The message I take from the passage in Isaiah today is that
GOD promises to provide for those who seek the LORD.  Divine providence may not
be apparent presently, but the LORD will make things right when the LORD comes
as redeemer.  At that time, the GODly righteous will be given the rewards of
their faith lived out in GOoD works.  This does not mean they are only doing
GOoD so as to be reward, but that they are doing what GOD wants because it is
GOD’s will.  GOD will honor those who seek to fulfill the ways of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm parallels the First Reading by using the imagery
of life-giving</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>water that nourishes and provides growth for the plants that
sink their roots into flowing stream.  Being rooted in that which gives life,
makes a difference in what is produced by the plant/tree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Jesus is aware that He cannot make certain
people</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>understand GOD’s message or be satisfied with how some
people live out their relationship with GOD.  Some of His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>listeners had complained about John the Baptist, saying that
he was too strict and did not enjoy life.  These same individuals</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are upset that Jesus does not seem to take things seriously
enough since He is always eating at big feasts, and what is worse, doing it
with known, public sinners.  Jesus’ final line today is that time will show
that He (as well as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John the Baptist) has been doing the will of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I continue along my Advent journey, I consider a couple
of thoughts as a result of today’s reading.  First of all, what is most
important is doing the will of GOD.  The second thing is that GOD knows what is
in my heart</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(and the hearts of all people) and GOD will set things
straight, even though it may not be until the Lord Jesus comes again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As far as doing GOD’s will, I realize that it does not mean
that I must do what other people think is GOD’s will.  I must honestly,
prayerfully, and with the help of the Holy Spirit, discern what GOD wants me to
do.  The temptation for me is to do what other people want or even what some
say they know to be GOD’s will.  There may be some who tend to be more
conservative in their view of GOD’s plan.  They will try to direct me to be
more serious, or to do it their way.  There may also be some who are more lax
and liberal in their interpretation </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of GOD’s commands.  They will tell me that I need to lighten
up in my walk with the Lord Jesus.  [Having a spiritual director can help us,
if we choose a person who is spiritual and doesn’t tell us what to do but
challenges us to reflect on what GOD may be asking of us.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The truth is I am only accountable to GOD and GOD alone.  I
must seek to do what GOD instructs me to do</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>through GOD’s holy word.  I must reflect on what that is,
while I keep my eyes focused on the One Who is the Way, the Truth, and the
Life.  Yes, I must avoid being scandalous to those who may have a different
view than I do, but I must be faithful above all else to GOD’s directives.  I
must prayerfully, humbly, and honestly seek GOD’s will for my life.  I can seek
spiritual direction from others who are walking the way of the Lord Jesus.  I
must ask for the guidance of the Holy Spirit as I sit at the feet of the
Master-Teacher and learn from Him, either directly or indirectly (from a
spiritual director or another person who is seeking to live out GOD’s calling).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second thought that comes to me today is that of GOD
setting things straight.  That ties into the theme of Advent.  The time of
GOD’s final vindication and setting things straight will not take place until
the Lord Jesus’ Final Coming (Adventus).  That does not give me free reign to
do whatever I want, figuring that the Lord Jesus still has quite a while before
He returns.  On the contrary, I must act as if Jesus is coming tomorrow, even
today, for only GOD knows when the Lord Jesus will come again. [Even during
Jesus’ earthly life, He did not know when the end time would be. (Mark 13:
32)]  I must live a life that is prepared to welcome the Lord Jesus whenever He
comes, even at this very moment.  I must consciously act in a way that shows
that I am sinking my roots deep down into the source of life – GOD’s life. 
Thus, I must be radical (as John the Baptist and Jesus were radical).  I must
sink my roots (radices from which comes the word “radical”) in the GOD Who
gives and nourishes life (both earthly and eternally).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A side effect of doing that is that I will be producing GOoD
fruit – GOD’s fruit.  Others will be nourished by </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>my actions.  GOD’s GOoD News will be spread.  New life will
be manifested.  And, most importantly, GOD will be praised!  It is thus that we
can paraphrase the psalm today and say:  “Blessed are those who delight in the
law of the LORD and meditate on GOD’s law day and night.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   For what reasons
do I seek to bear GOoD fruit?  Am I hoping to be rewarded for my GOoDness, or
am I responding to my being already graced by GOD?  How can I bear fruit that
will be beneficial to others today?  In what aspect of GOD’s life do I need to
be more rooted – more radical?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, source of all life.  Through Your
GOoDness, You want us to grow into living beings who produce rich and abundant fruits,
that in turn will give glory and praise to You and also be a blessing to
others.  All You ask of us is that we sink our roots deeply down to where we
can tap into Your life- giving spiritual nutrients.  We have often been formed
more by the harsh winds that blow around us, or the false promises of miracle
growth, if we turn away from You, our life source, and turn to other ways.  For
the times we have failed to seek Your life-giving Reign in our lives, we ask
for Your forgiveness and healing.  For the times we have sought to please
others rather than do Your will, we ask for the strength and courage to stand
firm, rooted in You.  We thank You for Your sending Your Son, Jesus, to give us
an example, to guide us along the way, to provide what we truly need to be
fruitful growth in Your Reign.  It is in His name that we make this prayer, for
He is our Way, our Truth, and our Life; He is our Master-Teacher and Guide.  It
is He Who will come again to set all things straight and it is He Who is living
and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>December 12, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(replacing the readings for Fri. of 2nd Week of Advent)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings can be obtained from:  http://usccb.org/bible/readings/121225.cfm</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Lady of Guadalupe:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/our-lady-of-guadalupe</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Zechariah 2: 14-17     or       Rev. 11:19a, 12:
1-6a, 10ab;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Judith 13: 10bcde, 19;           Luke 1: 26-38   or    Luke
1: 39-47</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we reflect on Mary’s role in the plan of salvation.
Today is the feast</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Mary under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe. There are
two choices for the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First Reading and two choices for the Gospel reading. The
Zechariah reading is addressed to the “daughter of Zion.” Because of the LORD’s
Coming, all nations will be blessed. The passage from Revelation describes a
woman who gives birth to the One Who is destined to rule all nations. The
Responsorial is from Judith. It speaks of the blessedness of one woman among
all other. The Gospel choices are both taken from the first chapter of St.
Luke’s Gospel. The first is the account of the angel Gabriel appearing to Mary
to announce the birth of Jesus through the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit.
The second is Mary’s response to GOD’s message when she visits her elderly
cousin, Elizabeth. Not only does she say “yes” to GOD, but also she immediately
travels to be with Elizabeth, to assist her in her last three months of
pregnancy before Elizabeth gives birth to John the Baptist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The passage from Zechariah is an appropriate reading on this
feast day of Mary, for she was considered a daughter of Zion for many reasons.
She was one of the Chosen People who worshiped on Zion (part of Jerusalem).
According to some traditions, she was said to have been raised in Jerusalem
(Zion). Again, according to some traditions, her final home (in which she is
reported to have fallen asleep at the end of her life) was on Mt. Zion. The
reading is also appropriate for Advent because it speaks of the Coming of the
LORD. When the LORD comes, the LORD will gather people from many nations and
make them GOD’s own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the vision of heaven recounted in the Book of Revelation,
the author sees a woman who is about to give birth to the One Who is destined
to rule the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>nations. It is through the Child born of the woman that
salvation is brought to the world. Obviously</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>this has direct links to Mary, who gave human life to Jesus,
our Savior. Also of interest is the imagery of the woman who is “clothed with
the sun with moon under her feet.” These are seen in the  image of Mary
[http://www.sancta.org/intro.html] in the tilma (outer garment) worn by Juan
Diego when he presented the roses to the Bishop of Mexico City on January 12,
1531. The rays of the sun are behind the Virgin and it looks like she is
clothed with the rays. She is standing on a crescent moon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Responsorial is from the Book of Judith. It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speaks about the unique position of one woman. Although
originally written about the Hebrew woman named Judith, it has parallels with
Mary, who is addressed by her cousin Elizabeth as “blessed among all women.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account of the Annunciation relates GOD’s invitation to
Mary to be the mother of the Messiah. The faith of the young Jewish woman is
remarkable. She seeks to do GOD’s will, even though she does not fully
understand all which that entails. She wants to serve GOD in whatever way GOD
wants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account of the Visitation to Elizabeth by Mary is also
highly appropriate for our reflection for this feast during Advent. After being
told that she is to give birth to the Messiah, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary’s first concern is not for herself. She is not filled
with pride expecting people to wait on her since she will give birth to the
Messiah (the Christ – the Anointed One of GOD). Because of Gabriel’s message,
she knows that her elderly kinswoman (Elizabeth) will soon give birth to a
child. She hastens to go to Elizabeth’s aid. Elizabeth recognizes the blessing
of GOD in Mary and feels privileged to be visited by her younger relative who
carries a special Child within her womb. Rather than focusing on herself, Mary
praises the work GOD is doing in her life through her prayer of praise to GOD,
the Magnificat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings and on the events that happened
in Mexico in the sixteenth century, I am touched by the glory of GOD. GOD’s
plan is for the peoples of all lands and nations to experience the GOoD News
that Mary’s Son</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>brought to the world. Mary had an important role in the
history of salvation. Her willingness to do GOD’s will enable her to bring the
Son of GOD into the world in His human nature. Her attitude of servanthood is
the model for all women (and also men) to follow. From a few passages in
scripture, we can see that she wanted to be of assistance to others so that
they could experience the love of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is interesting to me is that when Mary appeared to San
Juan Diego on the hill of Tepeyac (in Mexico), she looked like a native of that
area. Mary seems to have adapted to the local surroundings. This has happened
when she has appeared in other localities throughout the world. Mary wanted to
identify with the people to whom she brings the GOoD News of her Son’s coming
and His gift of salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The message for me in all this is that I must be like Mary.
I must be willing to do GOD’s will by saying “fiat” – “let it be.” Part of
doing GOD’s will is to be of service to others. I must be willing to adapt to
other people’s circumstances and meet them where they are, not where I am or
where I want them to be. I am called to bring forth Jesus to others, not in His
human existence, but in a spiritual way. And like Mary, I must always be
willing to give GOD the glory and praise. I must humble myself and lift up the
benevolence of GOD by saying with Mary, “My soul proclaims the greatness of the
LORD; my spirit rejoices in GOD my savior.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   What quality of
Mary is most important to me: humility, obedience, service? To what is GOD
asking me to respond with my own “fiat” – “let it be according to Your will”?
Am I able to let my soul proclaim the greatness of the LORD and rejoice in GOD
my savior?  Whom might I serve in a selfless way as Mary served Elizabeth?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all peoples. Through Your
GOoDness, You have chosen Mary to be the human mother of Your Son, Jesus. She
humbly accepted Your calling, even though she did not fully understand Your
plan. She was willing to say her “fiat” and do whatever You would ask of her.
Thinking of the needs of others first, she visited her aging relative Elizabeth
and assisted her during her last trimester of pregnancy. In giving birth to
Your Son, Mary truly shared a special gift with the world. Throughout His
ministry, she supported His spreading of Your GOoD News. Mary’s concern for all
Your people has been manifested over the ages. As we come to reflect on her
position in Your plan of salvation, we want to lift a prayer of praise and
thanks to You for allowing us to have the example of her selfless acts of
service, that show that she was in total relation with her Son Who was the
perfect example of service through His ministry, death, and resurrection. May
we be willing to say both “fiat” to Your plan for our lives and “Magnificat”
(My soul proclaims Your greatness). We make this prayer in the name of Jesus,
Your Son and the Son of Mary, Who is our Savior and Master-Teacher, and Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>December 13, 2025</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Memorial of St. Lucy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Readings from Sat. of the 2nd Week of Advent) Readings can
be obtained from:   http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/121325.cfm Saint
Lucy:   https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-lucy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Sirach 48: 1-4, 9-11;      Psalm 80: 2ac and 3b,
15-16, 18-19;      Matthew 17: 9a, 10-13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Advent journey continues.  We are still focusing on the
Coming (Adventus) of the Lord Jesus Christ. The reading from Sirach is a
reminder that the prophet Elijah is to come back before the Day of the LORD. 
The psalm is a prayer to GOD asking that GOD be faithful to the promises made
of old.  In the Gospel, Jesus links John the Baptist to the return of Elijah,
and in doing so, links Himself with the Day of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The author of the Book of Sirach echoes the commonly held
belief that since the prophet Elijah was miraculously taken from the earth in a
fiery chariot, he will return before the end of the world in order to prepare
the people for the Day of the LORD.  As a prophet, Elijah preached a message of
the people’s need to repent (Greek:  metanoia) their idolatry and other sins
that broke their relationship with GOD. Elijah sought to reconcile the people
with GOD, even if that reconciliation came with a great price — a severe
judgment for the people’s infidelity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist invokes</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD, seeking GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>commitment to having a relationship with the Chosen People. 
The prayer recalls GOD’s promise to take care of those whom GOD called,
especially those to whom GOD had given a special role in caring for the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel today takes places as Jesus leads Peter, James,
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John down from the mountain of the transfiguration.  The
three disciples had seen Jesus clothed in glory and talking to Moses and
Elijah.  They ask Jesus why it was said that Elijah would return. Jesus speaks
about the importance of the role of Elijah.  Elijah was called to announce the
need for metanoia – a turning back to GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and away from sinfulness.  Before the Day of the LORD,
people would be given a chance to repent and change their lives.  Jesus then
alludes to the fact that the message of repentance and metanoia had been
announced in the ministry of John the Baptist.  Thus, the Day of the LORD’s
coming was at hand.  Jesus hints at His role as the LORD Whose Day has come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of the message I take from the readings today is the
continual need for repentance.  Because sin still permeates our world,
repentance continues to be needed.  The role of Elijah/John the Baptist is not
over.  People still need to be reminded to turn to GOD, for the Final Day of
the Lord Jesus is yet to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And who is the modern Elijah/John the Baptist? Maybe no one
person strikes you as the prophet of repentance.  Is it because we have become
too soft on sin and do not hear the message of sin’s evilness? Maybe so.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another important thought is that each of us is called to be
a herald of repentance and reconciliation.  We must look at the sinfulness in
our own lives and turn away from sin and back to the Lord Jesus (metanoia).  We
should also be aware of GOD’s desire that all turn from their sinful ways and
turn back to GOD.  That does not mean that we need to stand on a soap box and
be prophets of doom.  It does mean that we must challenge </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the negative and sinful lifestyle so present in our society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an educator and catechist, I sense that it is my
responsibility to speak up when students are not acting properly, such as using
inappropriate language.  I must be willing to point out the wrongfulness of
some students making jokes about other students.  As I told my Latin class a
few years ago, the English word, “ridicule” (that comes from the Latin word for
“laugh”), is wrong, because it does not mean to laugh “with” a person, but to
laugh “at” a person.  I must also set an example of the need to ask for
forgiveness.  When I make a mistake, I must be willing to admit my mistake, for
I, too, am human and have faults.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As members of a family, we must be aware of how we have not
always worked for the GOoD of the whole family.  We must set the example of
apologizing for our mistakes and saying, “I am sorry.”  We must speak about the
importance of having a relationship with the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is all part of preparing for the Coming Day of the Lord
Jesus, whether that be today, tomorrow, or years from now.  I must be living a
life that reflects the relationship that GOD wants to have with me.  It also
means that I must join with others and pray the Responsorial from today’s
psalm, “LORD, make us turn to You; let us see Your face and we shall be saved,”
for it is only GOD Who can save and actually has already saved us through the
First Coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.  GOD will complete and finalize that
salvific day when Jesus comes again.  Yet we need to accept that gift of
salvation and live lives that proclaim our belief in His Coming again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I heard
the message of metanoia preached to me? What aspect of my life must I repent
(turn away from) so that I can turn more fully toward the Lord Jesus Christ and
be ready for His coming again? How can I be an ambassador of reconciliation and
peace to those with whom I come in contact?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Abba-Father.  Through Your
GOoDness, You desire that we turn to You.  We have not always been faithful in
our relationship with You.  We have chosen paths that lead us away from Your
presence.  We seek Your pardon and forgiveness for the sins we have committed. 
As You have called Elijah and John the Baptist, so You continue to call others,
including us, to proclaim Your message of repentance and metanoia.  May we be
heralds of the coming of Your Son, not just in His First Coming on earth when
He saved us through His death and resurrection, but also His Final Coming when
He will establish Your Reign for ever.  As we continue our Advent journey, we
ask that we may work for the Shalom (peace) that Your Son’s coming brings to
us.  We make this prayer in Jesus’ name for He is Your Son and our Lord and
Savior, Who will come again to set all things straight and it is He Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint John of the Cross:  https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-john-of-the-cross</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:             Isaiah 35: 1-6a, 10;          Psalm
146:  6-7, 8-9, 9-10;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                James 5: 7-10;   Matthew 11: 2-11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s almost here.  People’s excitement level is very high. 
Some are running around getting last-minute things prepared. Others just can’t
wait.  The air is filled with anticipation.  It’s hard being patient when
something so special is going to happen soon.  Do you feel the anxiousness?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Lord Jesus is coming. . .again.  The Lord will bring in
the Reign of GOD.  In some ways the Reign of GOD has begun.  It is already
here.  The fullness of the Reign of GOD, however, is not yet fully here. 
That’s what today’s readings present to us so that we can reflect on GOD’s
Reign over us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading portrays the words of Isaiah reassuring
the oppressed people of GOD that the things are going to change.  GOD is going
to renew the earth and the people of GOD will be restored not only to their
former glory, but even greater experiences will happen. The parched and barren
desert will bloom and flower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All will see the glory of GOD.  Those who are hurting and
disabled will be restored to full health.  GOD’s Reign will be re-established.
There will be change as the coming Reign of GOD begins, and all this will
happen soon, according to the words of the prophet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm continues this same theme of GOD’s bringing
restoration and healing, especially to the lowly.  The refrain is a prayer
asking the LORD to come and to give salvation to people of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Second Reading, James reminds his listeners,
including us, to be patient for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.  He tells
us that the Lord’s coming is at hand.  Things may be rough for a while, but
when the Lord Jesus comes, it will be better, a lot better, infinitely and
eternally better.  He tells those who read his letter to use the prophets as
role models.  The prophets knew that GOD would restore the divine Reign over
the people.  They had a sense that the restoration would come.  The Reign of GOD
was near at hand, but not fully present.  In announcing this message to the
people, the prophets met opposition, even persecution, yet they continued to
proclaim the need for preparation for the Coming Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel today we see the Reign of GOD in transition.
John the Baptist had proclaimed the immediacy of the Reign of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.  He knew it was near at hand.  He was dedicated to
announcing its coming.  And just as the Reign of GOD was beginning in the
ministry of Jesus, John was imprisoned. John was the last of the Hebrew
prophets – following in the footsteps of the prophets of old. When the Reign of
GOD would begin and be established, John’s role would be over.  And</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>so he sends his followers to Jesus so they could see the
transition from what was foretold by the former prophets to what is now taking
place in and through Jesus.  Jesus tells John’s followers that the prophecy of
Isaiah, that we heard in the First Reading, is now being fulfilled.  GOD’s
Reign is starting, the disabled are being restored to full health, the barren
and lifeless are being restored to life, and the GOoD News is being announced –
the Reign of GOD has begun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus then speaks about John the Baptist. He proclaims
John’s role as a prophet who prepares the way for One Who is coming to
establish the new Reign of GOD.  He raises</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John the Baptist to the highest rank among the prophets of
old.  And then Jesus asserts something that may seem strange to us: “Yet the
least born into the Reign of GOD is greater than he (John the Baptist).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on this, I have the thought that Jesus is
saying that John the Baptist is the greatest individual who lived before the
Reign of GOD began, but John was not able to fully experience the Reign of GOD.
Yet those who begin to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>experience the Reign of GOD are the ones who are truly
blessed.  I thought back to Moses and the Promised Land.  He had led the
Israelites out of the slavery in Egypt.  For forty years he guided them through
the desert.  He knew GOD was leading them into the Promised Land because GOD
has promised that.  Moses believed that the people would come into the Promised
Land, and for most of his life, Moses acted faithfully on that belief.  Moses
was able to climb a mountain and see the Promised Land, but he never stepped
foot in it.  In a similar manner, John announces the coming of the Reign of GOD
and he senses its arrival, but he never is able to see it fully flourish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is Gaudete Sunday.  Gaudete is Latin for “Rejoice.” 
We celebrate this Third Sunday of Advent with pink or rose color instead of the
blueish purple of the rest of Advent.  We are told to rejoice because the
Advent (“Coming”) of our Lord is near.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what does all that say to us on this Gaudete Sunday? We
are told to rejoice because the Advent of the Reign of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is near.  In fact, we are reassured, it is here.  It is
already present, but is not yet fully what it will be.  We see signs of the
presence of the Reign of GOD.  Jesus’s presence is already seen in many ways,
but the fullness of Jesus’s presence has not yet become a reality.  We are in a
state of transition.  We can already feel the excitement of GOD-with-us
(Immanuel), but we still are anxious for what is not yet fully accomplished.
Just as some people are already beginning their celebration of Christmas with
their decorating, gift giving, and parties, they are not yet celebrating the
fullness of Christmas.  Just as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we are already celebrating Jesus’ coming in His birth in
Bethlehem, we are not yet fully experiencing His coming again at the end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have reason to celebrate and rejoice.  The Lord is
already with us.  Yet, our joy is not yet full, because Jesus has not yet
finished establishing the completeness of the Reign of GOD.  We have to be
patient, as James reminds us today.  And we need to realize, as James also says
today, that we are called to share in the role of the prophets, or at least the
prophetic role of Jesus.  Through our baptism we indeed share in the prophetic
role of Jesus.  That does not mean that we are going to forecast the future –
that was not the role of the prophet.  It means we need to speak of the reality
of GOD and GOD’s Reign.  We need to proclaim the GOoD News of the Reign of
GOD.  And as St. Francis of Assisi reminded the people of his day, “Proclaim
the GOoD News at all times. . .and, if necessary, use words.” We are called to
proclaim the GOoD News of the Reign of GOD by the way we live our lives.  We
need to model our belief in the fact that we are already part of the Reign of
GOD, even if it is not yet fully here.  Our lives should be models of GOD’s
restoration of the disabled.  We can reach out to those who are lowly and treat
them with respect and dignity.  We can share with the less fortunate.  In doing
this we rejoicingly proclaim GOD-with-us already, but even better things are
yet to come.  We need to patiently treat those around us with the love GOD has
for us, so they will begin to look forward to the fullness of GOD’s love in the
final Reign of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Do I have the same
sort of anxious and joyful anticipation for the Second Coming of the Lord as I
do for celebrating His first coming (Christmas)? What can I do during these
last two weeks of Advent to focus not only my own attention but also the
attention of others toward the reason for this season: Jesus’ coming to us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, Lord GOD, Abba-Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ.  Through Your GOoDness and the ministry of Your Son, You have invited
us to experience Your Reign in our lives.  We have already begun to be a part
of it.  You promise, however, that we have not yet fully seen the glory that
will be, or as the grammatically incorrect phrase says, “You haven’t seen
nothing yet.”  You ask us to proclaim the Coming of the Your Reign by living lives
filled with rejoicing and yet patient, but active, expectation.  Through the
continued outpouring of the gifts of Your Holy Spirit, gives us the wisdom to
speak the comforting words to those who need to be reassured of Your presence
with them.  Give us the strength to endure patiently those things that hinder
the Reign of GOD.  In this way we can always rejoice and proclaim the GOoD News
of the Coming of Your Son, Jesus, not just His earthly birth, but also His
coming at the end of time when He will continue to live and reign with You and
the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Mary Frances Schervier:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-mary-frances-schervier</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Numbers 24: 2-7, 15-17a;       Psalm 25: 4-5ab, 6
and 7bc, 8-9;        Matthew 21: 23-27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we look at authority - GOD’s authority as spoken about
by prophets, the authority of John the Baptist and of Jesus.  The passage from
Numbers has been taken by some people as a Messianic promise, especially the
verse about the One Who is seen, but is not near, and the star and the staff
advancing from Jacob.  The psalm is a prayer to GOD, asking GOD to teach the
divine ways.  In the Gospel, Jesus demonstrates His authority by the way He
teaches.  When challenged to explain the origin of His authority, He poses a
question to those who oppose Him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even in the days of Moses, GOD’s presence was seen by
non-believers. Balaam, a sage from Midian, gives an oracle.  He realizes that
he cannot curse the Israelites because GOD is with them.  The oracle he gives
has verses that some believers take as a prediction of the coming of the
Messiah.  He speaks about seeing the One Whom GOD calls to rule, but not fully
seeing Him.  He also forecast that a star will come from Jacob and a staff from
Israel, an illusion to authority and power being present in the Israel and also
being associated with the Jesus, Who is linked to the star at His birth and
being the staff (descendant) of Jesse and the Shepherd’s staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Authority and power are divine attributes.  The psalmist
prays today for the ability to discern GOD’s ways so as to live a life in
accordance with GOD’s power and authority.  He asks GOD to teach him GOD’s way
and truth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In today’s Gospel, Jesus instructs the people with an
authority unlike the religious leaders of His day.  People sense that He
teaches with the full authority of GOD.  The religious powers-that-be are not
pleased with the way Jesus conducts His ministry with such authority.  They
know He comes from the northern province of Galilee and wonder </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>about His source of authority.  When they ask Him to present
His credentials, He turns the focus not on Himself but on those who question
Him.  He will explain His source of authority if they</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>speak about the origin of the authority of John the
Baptist’s ministry.  Jesus knows they will not answer that question because any
answer they would present would diminish their own authority in the eyes of the
people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Authority is a key element in these final days of the first
part of Advent.  We realize that Jesus has come with the authority of His Abba-Father. 
Yet the fullness of that authority is not yet completely established.  It will
only be accomplished when Jesus comes again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What do we do in the interim – between the time of Jesus’
First Coming and His Final Coming? I see that my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>response is to live under, and with, the authority of the
Lord Jesus.  First, I must place myself under GOD’s authority.  I must submit
and obey GOD’s commands.  Once I have learned to be in a humble and rightful
relationship with GOD, then I can continue to share in Jesus’ ministry to
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I am truly in a proper relationship with GOD, then I can
go out and give witness to the GOoD News of the Lord Jesus.  I can model a
behavior that is in agreement with the plan of GOD.  I will also be able to
speak and act with authority, not my authority but GOD’s authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As sinful human individuals, it is not easy to be under the
authority of GOD.  The greatest fear that some people have is that being under
GOD’s authority will limit their freedom and their choices.  They think they
will not be able to do as they please.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have come to realize that the opposite is true.  The more
I submit to the proper authority of GOD and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>submit to doing GOD’s will, the freer I become.  I don’t
have to worry about what I should do, for I will know what GOD expects of me. 
I will be able to act with a freedom of a child of GOD.  I also do not worry
about what others think about me, for I will experience the acceptance by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once I am in proper relationship with GOD, I am free to
continue the work of GOD.  I will minister and serve others with new enthusiasm
and spirit, for I will be acting not by my authority but with the authority of
GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We are living in the interim.  The Lord Jesus has come into
human history, living here on earth.  The Lord Jesus will come again, with full
authority and power, to usher in the final Reign of GOD.  We are people of the
interim.  We have experienced the authority of the Lord Jesus in His earthly
life and in our personal lives.  As we submit to the authority of GOD, we
experience the freedom of daughters and sons of GOD.  We can then continue
Jesus’ ministry, acting with His authority as long as we are in relationship
with Him.  It is then that we will be ready for Him when He returns again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What does authority
mean to me?  How do I handle myself when I am under someone else’s authority? 
Am I willing to submit to the authority of GOD? How do I exercise GODly
authority over others? What can I do to show that I am acting with authority of
GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever loving.  Through Your
GOoDness, You call us into a relationship with You, through Your Son, Jesus. 
He has entered our history and walked on the earth.  He came with Your
authority – teaching and ministering to others.  He was the model of obedient
submission to Your will.  He has called others to continue His work.  He is the
Master-Teacher Who instructs us in being under Your authority. He bestows Your
authority on us as we deepen our relationship with You and with Him.  We seek
Your pardon and forgiveness for the times we have resisted Your authority and
chosen to follow other paths.  We ask that You strengthen us and guide us by
the example of Your Son and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.  To You we lift
up this prayer of praise and thanks, for You continue to touch our lives with
Your authority, all for the GOoD of Your people and the praise of Your name. 
We lift this prayer of praise to You in the name of Jesus, Your Son, our Master-Teacher,
Who is with us through the power of the Holy Spirit, and Who is also living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.
Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Honoratus Kozminski:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-honoratus-kozminski</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Zephaniah 3: 1-2, 9-13;      Psalm 34: 2-3, 6-7, 17-18,
19 and 23;       Matthew 21: 28-32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starting tomorrow, we will begin focusing on the First
Adventus (“Coming”) of the Lord Jesus in the incarnation in the womb of Mary
and His birth in Bethlehem.  Today, however, our attention remains on the
Second (or Final) Adventus (“Coming”) of the Lord Jesus.  Today’s readings
speak of our making a choice on how we are going to live out the rest of our
earthly life and show that we are ready for the day of the Lord Jesus’ Final
Coming.  The reading from Zephaniah announces that the day is coming when those
who have not followed the LORD will be removed, while the faithful remnant will
experience a new sense of peace.  The Responsorial reminds us that GOD hears
the cry of the poor.  In the Gospel, Jesus challenges the religious leaders by
sharing with them a parable of a parent of two children.  When the parent asks
the two offspring to do something, one says “no” but ends up doing what is
asked; the other responds with a “yes” but does not do the will of the parent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reading from Zephaniah follows the prophet’s declaration
of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Day of Doom when GOD will exact judgment on the unfaithful
believers. Having described the Dies Irae (Day of Wrath) for the sinful people
before the Exile, the prophet now turns to describing the mercy and compassion
that the LORD will extend to the faithful remnant.  Once GOD has separated the
unrepentant and disobedient from the those who have remained</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>obedient to the LORD, the LORD will extend a period of peace
and justice to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>those who have sought to be faithful to the LORD.  GOD will
pour out the divine blessings on those who are remain faithful – full of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist proclaims the praise of GOD Who removes the
disobedient and sinful but Who listens to the cry of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anawim (the downtrodden, outcasts, and poor).  GOD is always
close to those who call upon the name of the LORD.  GOD will act with mercy and
compassion on those who have been faithful and yet have experienced the trials
and tribulations of life, particularly at the hands of evil doers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, as Jesus speaks with the authority figures of
the Jewish</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>faith, He asks them to discern which of two children is
truly obedient to the wishes of their parent.  When the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parent asks the two “kids” to perform a certain task, the
first speaks words of refusal, but later does what is asked.  The second one,
in contrast, responds with words of obedience, but does not do what is being
asked.  Jesus compares the religious leaders to the second offspring who says
“yes” but fails to do what is requested.  The repentant public sinners are
compared to the first child who initially refuses to do the parent’s demands,
but later fulfills what is asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we draw to the end of this first part of the Advent
season, we are called to reflect on our response to doing GOD’s will.  It is
easy to say “yes” to GOD, but it is harder to actually do what GOD asks of us. 
On the other side of the coin, there is hope for us who have sinned and had </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>said, or acted, with a “no” to the LORD GOD.  We can still
change our ways and begin to more fully respond to GOD by doing what we know</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

AAF_U/2UqnJLBXbR0/s1600/4462573_orig.gif </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is being asked of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading reminds us that we will all have to answer
to GOD at the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus.  The final judgment will be a
Dies Irae (Day of Wrath) for those whose final earthly decisions have been
a-theos (against GOD).  Yet for those of us who have repented of our sinful
ways and have striven to be ad Deum (toward GOD), it will be the beginning of
the final and eternal Reign of GOD, that has begun during Jesus’ life on earth,
but will reach its climax in heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to spend some time during these pre-Christmas days to
reflect on my life with GOD.  Nothing is more</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>important than looking at my relationship with my loving
Abba-Father and with the Son of GOD Who has come, and Who is coming again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Am I oriented
toward GOD (ad Deum) or am I moving away from GOD (a theos)? Of what do I need
to repent or, in other words, what course corrections do I need to make in
being more on target – more aligned with the GOD with Whom I hope to share all
eternity?  How can I manifest my orientation in a way that will be inviting to
others to come with me as I aim toward an eternal future with GOD? How can I
more fully live a life that reflects the words of the psalmist today (“I will
bless the LORD at all times; GOD’s praise shall be ever in my mouth.  Let my
soul glory in the LORD; the lowly will hear me and be glad”)?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all those who call upon You. 
Through Your GOoDness, You not only hear their prayer, but You also respond in
ways that show Your compassionate love.  You desire that all people not only
say “Yes” to Your plan for their lives, but that they orient themselves to
following You in all aspects of their lives.  For the times we have failed to
respond to Your requests of us or said “Yes” but not done what we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>said we would do, we seek Your forgiveness and pardon.  With
the help and example of Your Son, Jesus, and the guidance of Your Holy Spirit,
motivate us to full obedience yo Your will.  Correct those part of our lives
that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are out of sync with Your will.  We give You all the glory,
praise, and honor as we await the return of Your Son, our Lord and Savior,
Jesus, Who is the Way to You, and Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Genesis 49: 2, 8-10;       Psalm 72: 1-2, 3-4,
7-8, 17;       Matthew 1: 1-17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Welcome to the Second and Final Part of Advent!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today a shift in emphasis begins in our celebration of
Advent, and it is reflected in the readings.  From the First Sunday of Advent
until December 16 our focus has been on the Second Adventus (Coming) of Christ
at the end of time.  Today we prepare to celebrate Jesus’ First Adventus
(Coming) – His Incarnation and birth.  For the next few days, we will be
reading from the two</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gospels with Jesus’ infancy narratives – Matthew and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luke.  Both evangelists have important ideas to share, each
in his own way.  Beginning today we also use the “O Antiphons” for the Gospel
Acclamation.  These are the basis of the Advent Hymn,  O Come, O Come, Immanuel
(Veni, Veni, Immanuel).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our First Reading speaks of the role of Judah in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>plan of salvation.  Judah was one of the twelve sons of
Jacob (Israel).  He was not the first born (that would have been Ruben), nor
the favorite (Joseph), nor the youngest (Benjamin).  Today’s passage speaks of
Judah’s position with regards to his relationship with his eleven brothers. 
Judah (or at least his offspring) would become the leader and the ruler over
the rest of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the family of Israel.  Historically it is from the line of
Judah that King David came.  And from the line of King</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>David, the Messiah would come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that background, we switch to the beginning of the
Gospel of St. Matthew.  Matthew begins with lineage of Jesus through Joseph,
His step-father.  Matthew begins the genealogy with Abraham, the Father of
Hebrew nation and monotheistic faith.  He traces the line down through Judah
and David to Joseph, the husband</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Mary.  (Luke traces Jesus’s ancestors back to Adam, cf.
Luke 3: 23-38).  For Matthew, it was important to stress that Jesus was in the
royal line of Judah and particularly the Davidic branch.  In this way, Matthew
shows that Jesus is the fulfillment of the prophecies of the Hebrew Scriptures
(Old Testament).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may not be impressed with genealogies. They may seem like
a long list of names, some difficult to pronounce.  Yet, family and ancestry</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are very important, especially if they help to show Jesus as
the Messiah, the One spoken from of old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the telling of the story from both Genesis and Matthew
chapter 1, we don’t have the same exhortation to virtue that we had earlier in
Advent.  These are more informational and “historical” passages than reflective
suggestions on what to do.  They are giving us the background for the
Incarnation of Jesus.  My reflection flows from something that hit home –
literally and figuratively.  These readings spoke to me about the importance of
family.  We say that Christmas should be a family time.  Yet in our hustle and
bustle of preparing for the season, we sometimes forget about building
relationships.  We think about family presents instead of family presence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We think we are doing the loving thing by getting gifts,
when the most important gift we can give is our time with family members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe this flows out of a discussion we had a several years
ago during this time of year.  One member of our family was home for dinner
before his return for his last final for that term at USC.  We were talking
about our plans for the Christmas vacation.  Each person stated where they
wanted to be and when they wanted to be there.  There were conflicts in
scheduling.  How would we all get to be where we wanted, when we wanted, and
still be with each other? Things were not totally resolved when dinner was
over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That year gave me a reason to think.  What were we saying
about our family? Yes, spending time with a grandparent, cousins, friends, and
attending</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/27/e
c/4d/27ec4d8ea110130569c6bb7d7885b533.jpg </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>special social events is important.  So is the special time
we spend with our immediate family.  We often thought and said, “Oh, I will
spend time with you. . .later. . .when I am not doing what I want to do.”  What
does this say about the priority of our family relationships? And what if
“later” never comes?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This year, like many of the more recent years, we hope
things will be a bit different than they were when all the family members were
doing their own individual things.  In the past couple years, our family has
been able to be under the same roof for some quality time.  The younger
generation will be returning “home” from their current living places.  A couple
of the immediate family will have to probably leave a few times to work at one
of their jobs (in the entertainment industry).  Another’s business seems to
slow down during the Christmas season, that makes it possible for him to stay
at the house for consecutive days, except when he might leave to spend New
Year’s Eve with his fiancé who will be celebrating her birthday.  We are
looking forward to being able to spend some relaxing time enjoying each other’s
presence.  The focus is on presence, not presents.  There is almost a sense
that Christmas may never be like it once was when the kids were little and we
were together for two weeks, enjoying each other’s company and playing games,
singing Christmas songs, etc.  Now we need to value our time together.  This is
the time of the year when the family members are together for the longest time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Advent journey, besides spending time
reflecting on the Incarnation of Jesus, let us focus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on the fact that Jesus is GOD born into a human family.  GOD
blesses family life by Jesus’ participation in a human family.  Maybe we should
spend a little time thinking about how we can bless the other members of our
family by giving them our presence, instead of presents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How can I gift my
family members (or close friends?) with presence rather than presents? Do I
need to be reconciled with one or more of my family members? What can I do to
help others value the family (whether that be blood or emotional ties) of which
they are a part?  How can I and others focus on the importance of GOD sharing
the Divine Presence with us in the person of Jesus the Christ, and how being in
touch with the presence of GOD through Jesus is more important any of the other
gifts/presents that our Abba- Father shares with us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Parent Yourself and the
One Who blesses family life not just by Your being a Trinity of Persons within
the GODhead, but also by allowing Your Son to become human and share in the
intimate life of a human family.  You have given us the greatest gift of all,
inviting us into Your family, not just the human family but</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>also the Family of You, Your Son, and the Holy Spirit. 
Bless our family/ies today.  Continue to unite us with our loved ones, even
with those who have “transitioned” out of this life and are now sharing Your
life fully in heaven.  Let us have an attitude of gratitude and a giving
heart.  Give us the patience and love to treat our family members with Your
loving presence.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, our
Brother, Who lived among us, died, and rose, and Who has gone before us to
prepare a heavenly home for us, and Who is one with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Jeremiah 23: 5-8;       Psalm 72: 1-2, 12-13,
18-19;       Matthew 1: 18-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s passages remind us of the role of Jesus, the Son of
GOD and the Son of Mary (the woman betrothed to Joseph).  Our First Reading
portrays The Messiah (The Christ, The Anointed One) as the One Who will bring
justice.  He is the offspring of Judah, of the royal lineage of David.  He
shall bring salvation to His people.  The psalm expands the role of the
Messiah, The Anointed of GOD.  Not only will He bring justice, but He will also
extend compassionate care to the lowly.  Through this Chosen One, GOD will be
given glory and praise.  The Gospel gives us the account of Joseph’s being
visited in a dream by an angel (messenger) of GOD informing him of the role of
the Baby to be born of Mary.  The Boy to be born will be the fulfillment of all
the Hebrew Scriptures and all of their promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jeremiah speaks to the people at the time of the Babylonian
Exile, telling them that, unlike the leaders of their day, GOD will send One
Who will be of the royal family of David.  This Chosen One will bring justice
to the oppressed.  This One will be greater than the mighty</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moses.  A newer sense of freedom will be given to those who
are faithful to GOD because of the message of the Anointed One.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm also speaks about the activity of the royal
descendant.  The concept of a compassionate and just ruler is brought forth by
the psalmist. The reign of this future king will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be marked by a time of peace and justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Matthew’s account of the activities taking place before the
birth of Jesus centers on Joseph, the descendant of David.  When Joseph finds
out that Mary is pregnant, and he knows that he is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>not the father, he is deeply troubled.  He respects Mary and
cannot understand how she became pregnant.  According to the law, Joseph should
have Mary stoned to death.  Yet, because he is a just man and cares for Mary,
he makes plan to divorce her and send her away quietly.  It is then that a
messenger (angel) from GOD appears in a dream to inform Joseph about the
origins and the future of the Child of Mary.  In agreement with Luke’s account,
the angel attributes the conception of the Child to the power of the Holy
Spirit coming down upon Mary.  Joseph is also told of the special role of the
One to be born of Mary.  He will save His people from their sins.  Thus, He is
to be called Yeshua (Jesus) a name which means “GOD saves.”  In a way
unthinkable for the people before this time, the Child is the fulfillment of
Isaiah’s prophecy of Immanuel – “GOD with us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I ponder on the Gospel account, I reflect also on the
human origins of Jesus.  Not just that He was the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Child of Mary, but that Mary and Joseph struggled with
issues as the result of Jesus’ presence in their life, even before He was
born.  Joseph had taken on the role of caring for Mary and being her spouse. 
Yet, before they started living in the same household, Mary is found to be
pregnant.  There is no account of Mary trying to explain to Joseph her
pregnancy.  Joseph was in a difficult position.  According to the law, Mary had
broken their betrothal and marriage vows.  Joseph had previously come to value
the faithfulness of Mary and wondered about her pregnancy.  Not wanting to have
Mary killed, as would have been his right and his duty under the law,  Joseph
decides to send her away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is only when Joseph had a difficult time of struggling
with what to do, that GOD sends a messenger (angel)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to Joseph in a dream, to reassure him what he should do –
take Mary as his wife and be the “father” of the Child </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>she was bringing into the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The faithfulness and justice of GOD is manifested in
Joseph’s life.  He accepts GOD’s message and does GOD’s will.  He provides for the
Child and His mother.  He proceeds to be part of the human family into which
Jesus, the Son of GOD, is born.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am moved by the way GOD orchestrates the plan of
salvation.  GOD acts in ways that are out of what we would consider the normal
and politically correct way of doing things.  GOD allows people to struggle
with human decisions, but GOD also steps in at the proper moment to encourage
and support those who are willing to do the divine will.  GOD also provides
very human examples of people to whom we can look.  GOD promises GOoD things
will come out of the most inconceivable situations (yes, I used a play on words
on purpose).  GOD has loved us enough to send the Divine Son into our world to
be “GOD saves” – Yeshua – Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remember corresponding with a GOoD friend about the
situations that the friend had faced in the past. Most of the issues dealt with
other family members:  an aging parent, siblings who seek only their own
desires, children who are greedy and not loving to their parent.  A year ago,
the individual wondered why family members could be so unconcerned for each
other and so selfish.  The message that I tried to get across is that our life
here on earth is not meant to be easy, as Mary and Joseph well experienced. 
Yet if one trusts GOD, GOD save us (Yeshua) and GOD is with us (Immanuel). 
This friend came to realize that GOD truly can do great things in our lives if
we seek to do what GOD asks of us.  Even the simplest acts of kindness to
others can be rewarded by blessings beyond our wildest expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only response we can have is that of the psalmist
today:  “Blessed be the LORD, the GOD of Israel, Who alone does wondrous deeds.
And blessed forever be GOD’s glorious name; may the whole earth be filled with
GOD’s glory.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  When I think about
the struggles that Mary and Joseph went through before, during, and after the
birth of Jesus, what comes to my mind? Do I pray to do GOD’s will, even though
it is not what others want me to do? Am I able to accept GOD’s will and give
GOD praise even in the most perplexing situations? How can I reassure others
who are going through tough times? Have I ever sensed that GOD has communicated
with me, informing me what I must do? How did I react?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of love and compassion. Through
Your GOoDness, You desired to save us from our sins. Thus, You sent Your Son to
be born of Mary. Jesus’ initial coming (advent) brought a bit of worry and
troubled times to those who were to be part of His human family, but His coming
also brought peace and justice to all who call upon You. It was through
submission to Your plan that Joseph and Mary were assured of their roles as the
human family for Your Son. That did not remove all their human problems or difficulties,
but it brought them the peace of knowing they were seeking to do Your will. At
times we have not only struggled to understand Your plan for our lives, but
also we have worked against Your will. For this we seek Your pardon and peace.
Through the power of the Holy Spirit, help us to be open to the Lord Jesus’
coming into our lives. May we be willing to help the growth of His mystical
body, as Mary and Joseph aided His physical growth. We give You all the glory
and praise, together with Your Son, Yeshua (Jesus), our Savior and Brother, Who
has saved us by His death and resurrection and Who is Immanuel (“GOD-with-us”)
and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed Pope Urban V:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/blessed-pope-urban-v</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:  Judges 13: 2-7, 24-25;       Psalm 71: 3-4, 5-6,
16-17;       Luke 1: 5-25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading from Judges has many parallels to the
Gospel reading from Luke.  Both speak of elderly couples who have never had
children.  Both accounts present a messenger (angel) from GOD making an
announcement of the birth of a son.  Both times the angel</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(messenger) comes to the parent-to-be during a time of
prayer. Both speak about the role of the boy to be born of the elderly
parents.  Both stories also have the parents amazed at the possibility of their
having a child at such an old age,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The account from Judges speaks about the birth of Samson, a
child who will be a Nazarite (a section of Israelite people who never cut their
hair, never drink, and live austere lives).  Luke’s account is the announcement
of the birth of John the Baptist.  He, too, will live an ascetic life.  Both
Samson and John will have key roles in helping the people of GOD prepare for a
new life of freedom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The name Samson means “One who serves.”  The name John means
“GOD is gracious.”  Both of these individuals will embody their names by the
lives they will live.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I was reflecting on these two scripture passages, three
things came to mind:  1) even when situations seem impossible, GOD can make
great events happen; 2) through prayer we can come to a clearer understanding
of what GOD’s plan might be; and 3) what we do – working with GOD – can be
beneficial not just for ourselves, but for the people whom GOD wants us to
help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How often do we, like Zechariah, question the power of GOD?
Sometimes we doubt that GOD will intervene in our lives.  We don’t trust GOD
enough.  And then when we hear about what GOD can and will do, we doubt that it
will ever happen, at least for us.  We sometimes don’t believe enough in the
LORD’s powerful action.  We seem to think that miracles are from an earlier
time.  Yet, the truth is that GOD is as active now as ever, we just aren’t
tuned into how the LORD GOD might be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>acting in our lives.  GOD, as in ages past, works in
mysterious ways, often using “normal” circumstances to touch our lives with
divine grace.  It is only when we take the time to reflect on the “normal”
circumstances that we can see the hand of GOD at work.  Even in this year of
2023, as we</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>have faced the illnesses, forest fires, wars, terrible
blizzards, hurricanes, political unrest, shootings, burglaries, etc., GOD has
been, and continues to be, working in miraculous ways, if we take the time to
look about and reflect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is when we take the time to reflect and pray that we
start to see the divine plan.  GOD is truly present in our lives.  Often, we
clutter our lives with so many other things, that we do not see GOD in the here
and now. As many know, one of my favorite passages in scripture is Romans 8: 28
– “All things work together for the GOoD of those who are called by GOD.”  GOD
can use the “normal” and “abnormal” happenings to work for our GOoD.  It is
when we focus on GOD’s activity through prayer and reflection that we see all
things working for the GOoD of people whom GOD loves – that is, everyone.  They
may not be for our pleasure, but they are for our GOoD.  As we contemplate how
events and circumstances in our lives have unfolded, we can see how they can be
for our GOoD and the GOoD of those around us (locally and globally).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, things work together for our personal GOoD, but it
can’t stop there.  Our personal edification is often </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the first step GOD uses.  GOD then wants us to take the
divine GOoDness that we have received and work for the betterment, the
edification, the up-building of others.  I remember one of my spiritual
directors once said, “If we allow it, everything that happens in our lives can
be of benefit for ourselves and for others.”  As we become more aware of the
presence of GOD in our lives, of our relationship to a GOD who is active, we will
be aware of GOD’s actions in other people’s lives.  We will then be able to
help them see GOD at work.  Thus, we will give them an opportunity to draw
closer into relationship with the GOD who loves them.  This is the GOoD News</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that we are called to proclaim:  GOD is with us, not just in
the Incarnation of Jesus, but also in our personal lives, because of the
Incarnation of Jesus.  GOD first saves (gives us salus - makes us whole and
holy) through the death and resurrection of Jesus, but also in our daily lives
that are torn apart by brokenness and apparent absurdity.  GOD is working here
and now, through Jesus and through others and through normal circumstances to
make us experience salus – wholeness of body, mind, soul, and heart – so we can
then praise GOD and love GOD with our whole body, mind, soul, and heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About nine years ago during Advent, I received an email from
a friend who receives the daily reflections I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>send out.  This is what he wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Good morning, Bob.  Thanks again for your words of wisdom
and encouragement.  I was a little down this morning as I thought about what I
had not done and what I thought I needed to do at this wonderful time of the
year.  As I prayed for God’s help to be Yoked with Jesus I could feel the Power
of [God’s] Love begin to lift me up and allow me to be where [God] knew I
should be. [God’s] answers are Always what I need.  God is so Awesome.  [God’s]
Blessings are never, never ending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have a deeper understanding of the three issues I
discussed (GOD’s powerful activity in our lives; discernment through prayer;
and purpose of GOD’s gift to edify and build up others).  The friend who wrote
seemed to be aware of those same three issues in the note he wrote.  Each of us
has been gifted by GOD in special ways so that we can fulfill GOD’s plan of
helping others draw closer to the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So today, I am going to look at my life and be aware of
GOD’s actions in my life and the lives of others.  I will be “John” – a person
who proclaims, “GOD is gracious.”  I will expect to see miracles.  I will spend
the time reflecting on the circumstances of my life and the lives of others to
see the divine plan at work.  And then I will be “Samson” – “One who serves”
and I will proclaim by my actions that GOD is with us – GOD is active and
working for our salus - wholeness, holiness, salvation.  And doing this, GOD
will be able to do even greater things and receive the glory that GOD is due.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How often do I look
to see GOD’s actions in my life? Do I take the time, especially during this
busy time of year, to reflect on my life and try to see how GOD is touching my
life for my own GOoD? Am I able to proclaim that “GOD is gracious”? Do I sense
my call to be a Samson – “One who serves”?  How will I serve others as I use my
gifts today as a sign of my willingness to live out my role in proclaiming the
gifts and GOoDness of GOD?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of power and might.  Through Your
GOoDness, Your divine plan allowed Your Son to become flesh and live among us
so that we might be reminded of Your love and Your action in our lives. We
thank You and praise You for being a GOD ever present, GOD-with-us, first in
the Incarnation of Jesus, and also in the daily lives we lead.  May we realize
that You are still actively working for our salus – our wholeness – of our
body, mind, soul, and heart, so we can then be in relationship with You, Your
Son, and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, now and forever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Saint Dominic of Silos:  
https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-of-the-day/saint-dominic-of-silos</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Isaiah 7: 10-14;          Psalm 24: 1-2, 3-4ab,
5-6;            Luke 1: 26-38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The virgin shall give birth to a Son who will be a
manifestation of GOD’s presence.  This is what is proclaimed in the reading
from Isaiah and the Gospel.  This is also what we celebrate in five days – the
incarnation of GOD’s presence in the birth of the Male Offspring of the Virgin
Mary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isaiah may have had another male offspring of the royal
Davidic Family in mind when he gave GOD’s prophecy concerning the birth from a
virgin (Hebrew word is almah).  He might have been forecasting the future birth
of the GOoD king named Hezekiah, born of a young, unmarried (at the time of the
prophecy) woman (almah). The Holy Spirit has the ability to allow the Word of
GOD to take on a more important meaning than the prophets originally had thought.
Although the child will be called Emmanuel - “GOD with us,” the boy</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>will not be truly GOD Who is with them, as will the Child to
be born of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary that we hear about in the Gospel.  Isaiah was
predicting a time</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when the human ruler would manifest GOD’s presence in a way
not done by the present king, Ahaz.  Isaiah wants King Ahaz and all the people
to trust in GOD and believe that GOD is working in their midst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm also promises a blessing for those who seek GOD’s
face.  Part of seeking the face of GOD includes allowing GOD to reign and take
control rather than allowing anyone or anything else be in charge of one’s
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel of Luke, we hear that same thought, especially
after Gabriel’s announcement, and Mary, a virgin, allows GOD to move mightily
in her life.  She freely chooses to let GOD’s will be done in her.  In doing so
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Holy Spirit comes upon her and she conceives Immanuel (or
the alternate spelling, Emmanuel) – “GOD-with-us.”  GOD reveals the fullness of
divine presence and people will see GOD’s face in the Child to be born of Mary.
Jesus’ being born of Mary fulfills Isaiah promises in a way Isaiah could never
have imagined, yet GOD knew when the LORD inspired the prophet to speak and
write.  And even though Mary does not ask for a sign of GOD’s infinite power
and ability, Gabriel shows that GOD can allow an elder, barren woman</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>(Elizabeth) to give birth; thus, nothing is or will be
impossible for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings, I am moved by the powerful
love of GOD.  GOD has always wanted a close relationship with humans.  From the
first chapters of the Book of Genesis, GOD is seen as desiring to be a
companion of mortals.  Yet, because of humankind’s sinfulness, GOD was not able
to show the divine face fully.  Even though mortals desired to see the face of
GOD and know GOD was with them, they also were fearful (in a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>negative sense) of GOD’s self- revelation.  Thus, in the
fullness of time, GOD took on human flesh, first as a baby, growing later </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>into an adult, in order to allow us to see GOD face to face
in a way that we could handle and to Whom we could relate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For GOD, nothing is impossible.  GOD, the author of human
life, is free to limit the fullness of the divinity to the frailty of human
nature.  And all this is possible because of GOD’s great love for humanity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I never cease to be amazed at the awesomeness of the
Incarnation. The more I ponder GOD becoming human in Jesus, the more I am
humbled and left in awe – awe-filled.  GOD’s love for humanity is beyond my
full comprehension.  And to make it even more personal, the fact that GOD loves
me, sinful me, enough to allow Jesus to be born of Mary is mind-blowing.  Jesus
demonstrates that GOD truly is Immanuel – “GOD with us.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recall a priest friend of mine who referred to our human
body as a tent, that, at</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the end of our earthly life, is folded up and our “being” or
“soul” goes on without the tent.  I am reminded of the words of the prologue to
the Gospel of John.  In verse 14 of the first chapter, it says, “And the Word became
flesh and dwelled among us.”  To me I am always touched by the word,
“dwelled.”  In Greek, the Word is (εσκενοσεν) eskenosen which literally
translates as “pitched a tent” among us.  Jesus took on flesh and dwelled in a
human tent (body) like ours.  For the ancient Hebrews, “to pitch a tent” with
others meant to share life fully with them, to experience the joys and sorrows
of those among whom the tent was pitched.  The Letter to the Hebrews reminds us
that Jesus was “like us in all things but sin.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue on the last few days of this Advent journey,
let us take time to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reflect on what the mystery of the Incarnation means to each
of us personally and to us as a group of believers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today: What does it mean to
me personally that Jesus is Immanuel/Emmanuel (“GOD-with-us”)? How have I
experienced “GOD-with-us” in my daily life, especially in the past few days? 
How can I bring the experience of “GOD-with- us” to others?  With whom have I
“pitched my tent” and how can I share with them the importance of GOD’s
pitching a tent among us?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, almighty and all powerful, with
You all things are possible.  Through Your GOoDness and because of Your great
love, You allowed Your Son to take on our human flesh and pitch His tent among
us so that we might be able to look on the human face of the Divine and come to
know Immanuel –</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD with us.  Even if Jesus had not gone to the full extent
of dying and rising, the mere fact that He shared our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humanity with us is so mind-blowing.  Your desire to be with
us and have us be loved by You is awesome/awe- filled.  Yet, so often we take
it for granted or just ignore Your presence with us.  For this we seek Your
pardon and forgiveness.  With the power of the Holy Spirit, may we always be
aware of Your presence with us.  We make this prayer through Your Son, the Word
in flesh, Who has pitched His tent among us.  He is our Lord and Savior, Who is
living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for
ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Song of Songs 2: 8-14  or  Zephaniah 3:
14-18;       Psalm 33: 2-3, 11-12, 20-22;         Luke 1: 39-45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s readings are upbeat and positive.  We are given a
choice of two readings for our First Reading.  The one from Song of Songs
speaks about a lover coming like a gazelle (antelope) leaping over the hills,
gracefully moving forward. It has images of the winter being over and new life
sprouting.  Even though today is the first day of winter, we can think forward to
the joy of springtime.  This reading ise lively, joy-filled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other First Reading, from Zephaniah, is telling the
people of Israel and Jerusalem to rejoice for the LORD is coming, not in
judgment, but to restore the people to their rightful place.  It continues with
the message that the people should rejoice and be filled with gladness, singing
joyfully.  And, to some</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people’s surprise, it describes GOD as being joyful and
singing because of the people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm refrain carries the theme of joyful celebration
further, saying “Cry out with joy in the LORD, you holy ones, sing a new song
to the LORD.”  Trusting in GOD will lead to joy and happiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel for today is the account of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Visitation of Mary to her elder cousin/ relative,
Elizabeth.  It begins right after Mary has agreed to GOD’s request (that was
presented by the angel Gabriel):  to become the mother of the Son of GOD. It
says that Mary proceeded in haste to the town of Elizabeth, traditionally
recognized as the town of Ain Karem a few miles west of Jerusalem.  Mary and
Elizabeth are both filled with joy, surrounded by the presence of the Holy
Spirit.  The sense of inner happiness (joy) and peace flows through the scene. 
Both women are blessed with each other’s presence and the babies within their
wombs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few years ago on this date, I had an experience that
somewhat mirrored what might have happened at the visitation.  We had dinner
with a family member’s former chemistry teacher/longtime friend/member then of
the gated community in which the women lived, in separate homes.  After dinner
the women exchanged gifts – simple gifts, but gifts that spoke of their
friendship.  It was a very touching scene to me as they treasured not only the
gifts, but also what the gifts represented, a shared friendship.  Their joy and
happiness reflected the times they had shared – both upbeat and downbeat
moments, especially over the past few years when they had lived a few houses
apart and the two shared almost daily time with each other.  Each</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>had gone out of their way to choose something that they
perceived the other</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would truly appreciate.  Yet the willingness to give and
share their lives was more important than the gifts.  They also shared a common
commitment to GOD, even if from different Christian traditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As one of the friends was preparing to leave for ten days,
she shared with the other some thoughts on what should be done while she was
gone, and, especially in case of her not returning.  It was a sensitive time,
because they did not want to think they would be away from each other for ten
days, and, in the event of a tragedy, forever in this world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One key thing about this special time of sharing between the
two women was the fact of just spending time </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>together.  The ability to be in each other’s presence was a
present (gift) in and of itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I transferred this bond of friendship, trust, and
willingness to do for the other to today’s Gospel passage. Mary and Elizabeth,
even though they had been apart probably for quite some time, were blessed with
each other’s company.  Mary was there to help her kinswoman.  She would do
anything for her elderly relative. Elizabeth was surely pleased with the help,
but even more pleased with the present of presence.  She had someone with whom
she could share her experiences.  They also were very much aware of GOD’s
working in their lives, individually and together.  They were not sure what the
future would hold for their sons (John the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baptist and Jesus), but they trusted in GOD and knew that
GOD was going to be glorified by the ministry of their offspring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the visitation of two sets of women, I am
moved by the awareness of joy that comes when two believers are willing to
share with each other.  Being kindred in Spirit is truly a reason to praise
GOD.  To know that someone else is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>walking down a similar path of faith can bring strength.  It
makes me more willing to help others in simple ways this holy time of year.  I
was pleased to be able to put that in practice when I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>drove some friends to the airport.  I remember doing the
same thing a few years ago when I also counted it a blessing to be able to drop
off a friend’s car at the automotive repair station (after I dropped him off at
the airport) and walk two miles home.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gave me time to think about how giving of my time and being
present with another was truly a time blessed by GOD.  I was aware of GOD’s
presence in being of service to a close friend.  I also do something every
Sunday morning, arriving at church early, I unlock the church, and I</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>await the coming of the person who unlocks the church every
other day of the week.  We then spend time sharing the “lowdown” of what has
happened since the Sunday before when we had met and shared our stories.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we approach this time of giving and sharing with friends
and relatives, let us realize the most important gift is that of presence –
willingness to be attentive to the other, as Mary was to Elizabeth.  May we
realize the joy that comes from GOD when we give of ourselves in caring service
of another.  And, as we heard in the passage from Zephaniah, GOD rejoices and
is glad and GOD sings because of people being joyful in the LORD!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  What does my
spending time with loved ones and friends say about my awareness of GOD’s
presence in others and in me?  How can I be more of service to others during
these days of joy and gift giving?  When I sing the carols of Christmas, do I
focus on the words that give glory to GOD for sending the Son to be born a
human and to bring about our salvation? How can I help others focus more on the
true reason for the season – Jesus’ Incarnation for our salvation? What do I
imagine as I hear that GOD rejoices in me, sings for me, and dances for my joy?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all graces.  Through Your
GOoDness, You invite us into a relationship with You especially through the
Incarnation, ministry, death, and resurrection of Your Son.  You are ultimately
a GOD of relationship, first within the Trinity, and secondarily, with those who
accept Your invitation to share Your life of grace.  May we experience Your
presence as we treasure the relationships we have with those who are close to
us.  May we enjoy Your joy as we share life with others.  May we experience the
exultation You have as we share joyfully with others.  May we give You praise
and thanks for all those special relationships we have in life – all signs of
the intimacy You are sharing with us.  And may we, like Mary in Luke 1: 46-55,
give You all the glory and praise as we are able to spend time with friends and
loved ones during this holy season of the year when we celebrate Your Son’s
coming and living among us.  We make this prayer in His name, Jesus, for He is
our Brother and Savior, Who has lived among us and invites us to be with You
where He is now, once again, living and reigning, with You and the Holy Spirit,
our one and only GOD, forever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today’s First Reading and Responsorial are taken from the
story of the prophet Samuel.  Samuel’s mother, Hannah, was an old woman (like Elizabeth
– Mary’s cousin).  She desired to have a son.  She promised that if she gave
birth to a child, she would dedicate the boy to the LORD.  In the First Reading
for this day, after giving birth to Samuel and weaning him, she takes him to
the place of worship (Shiloh, since Jerusalem had not yet been conquered by the
Israelites) and presents him to the service of GOD.  After she does this, she
prays a beautiful prayer to GOD that speaks about what the LORD has done for
GOD’s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>people.  This prayer is the Responsorial for today.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The prayer of Mary in today’s Gospel pericope parallels the
prayer of Hannah in today’s Responsorial.  This prayer of Mary has been called
the Magnificat from the first word in the Latin version of prayer.  Magnificat
is translated as “Magnifies” or “proclaims the greatness.”  It is a prayer that
praises GOD for all the great things GOD has done for the People of GOD,
especially as seen in Mary’s own life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I recall going to Ein Karem, the town where Elizabeth was
said to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>be living when Mary visited her.  It was at the time of the
visitation that Mary proclaimed GOD’s praise in the beautiful Magnificat.  On
the walls outside the Church of the Visitation in Ein Karem, the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Magnificat is painted on tiles in the languages of many
nations.  This prayer is also used daily by the members of the Church in the
Evening Prayer of the Liturgy of the Hours.  This prayer gives us a lesson in
what prayer should be.  As the prayer ends, Luke tells us that Mary remains
with Elizabeth three months (until the time of the birth of Elizabeth’s son,
John the Baptist).  During this time, Mary continues to serve and help her
cousin prepare for delivery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This prayer, as I think I had mentioned in an early
reflection, reminds us what prayer should be.  A while ago, I attended a Bible
Study in which the participants focused on the Magnificat by studying each
phrase.  Some of the group had never reflected on it in such</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>detail.  This prayer demonstrates the relationship</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that Mary had with her GOD.  She begins with praise and
adoration – acknowledging Who</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD is.  GOD is an awesome GOD Who truly saves those who
call upon GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After proclaiming Who GOD is, the prayer goes on to speak of
Mary’s role in GOD’s plan.  Mary admits that she will be called blessed, not
because of what she has done, but because of what GOD has done, is doing, and
will be doing in her life.  Mary humbly speaks of her position as one who has
been blessed by GOD.  She thus admits her nothingness without GOD.  She goes on
to thank GOD for the great things GOD has done.  She speaks of GOD’s actions in
ways contrary to the ways of humans – lifting up the lowly and deposing the
proud and greedy.  The prayer concludes by acknowledging that GOD is ever
faithful, since GOD fulfills all of the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>divine promises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary thus shows her relationship with GOD – proclaiming the
awesomeness of the Almighty, and stating her humble position in the divine
plan. She speaks of her relationship with GOD in the present time, she reviews
what GOD has done in the past, and she looks forward to GOD’s continuing to
fulfill the divine promises in the future. And after praying the prayer, she
puts that relationship with GOD into action by being the servant of GOD in
service of her cousin, Elizabeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Prayer is a relationship with GOD that should lead us to
daily actions that manifest our relationship with GOD. Our time with GOD should
cause us</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to manifest our love for GOD, in GOD’s and our loving
service of others. After spending the quiet time in being in GOD’s presence, I
should want to put that relationship with GOD into action by reaching out to
others to announce GOD’s GOoD News of wanting to be a part of people’s lives.
Often, the best way I can proclaim that GOoD News is in the way I treat others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of years ago, I was talking to someone who was
immersed in Jesuit spirituality. The individual mentioned that what he liked
about the daily hour in prayer was following the Jesuit tradition of reading
scripture and picturing himself in the scripture passage and then seeing how he
could live out the scripture in his daily life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was also reminded of the importance of living out my
prayer life when a friend was troubled. This friend needed someone with whom to
talk, someone with whom the friend could interact. I was able to proclaim GOoD
News to this person by being attentive – making this person the most important
person in my life at that moment. In that way I was able to remind this person
that GOD cared for the person even more than I did. If I, in my limited
capacity, could give time and attention to a person struggling with a problem,
if I could try to raise this person from the lowly point to which the
individual had sunk, then GOD would truly raise the individual on high and give
that individual blessings beyond any comparison to the way I was treating the
person. This call to be attentive to others was reinforced six years ago as</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17 members of parish committed themselves to serve as
Stephen Ministers in one-to-one caring service of those going through rough
time and various crises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I reflect in my
prayer time how GOD has done marvelous things in my life? Does my spirit
rejoice in Jesus, my Savior? How do I put such a prayer of praise and thanks to
GOD into action during my interactions with other people? Who in my life is
most in need of having their spirit lifted by my spending time with them and
assisting them with what they are doing, especially in these hectic days before
celebrating the Incarnation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all compassion. Through Your
GOoDness, You sent Your Son, Jesus to be born among us as a human. He lived a
life of close relationship with You and He continues to call us into a closer
relationship with Himself and with You, His Abba-Father, in and through the
power of the Holy Spirit. You ask us to reflect and proclaim the greatness of
the Trinity. You remind us of how You have empowered us and lifted us up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You ask us to humbly reach out to others and help them feel
Your loving care for them, and Your presence in their lives. Continue to lead
us into a deeper understanding of Your awesome love for us, so we can share
that message with others. We make this prayer in the name of the Your Son, the
Lord Jesus Christ, Who was born for us, lived, ministered, gave us an example
of loving service, died for us, and is risen and is now living and reigning
with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:   Malachi 3: 1-4, 23-24;         Psalm 25: 4-5ab,
8-9,10 and 14;         Luke 1: 57-66</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our Advent journey, our readings for today
focus on the role of John the Baptist.  The words of the prophet Malachi speak
about one who will go before the coming (adventus) day of the LORD.  Obviously,
we take these words to point to John’s role as a pre-cursor for the coming Lord
Jesus Christ.  The psalm also describes a relationship similar to the
relationship that John had with GOD, that of being obedient to GOD and desiring
to learn the ways of the LORD so that he could prepare the pathway for the
LORD.  Today’s Gospel is the account of the birth of John the Baptist, six
months prior to the birth of Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malachi is often seen as a prophet of doom.  Today’s
selection has that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>element, but it also speaks of one who is the messenger of
the LORD.  The messenger announces that the LORD is coming, and that people
should turn their hearts to the LORD.  He refers to this messenger as Elijah,
the prophet of old who did not die, but was taken to heaven in a chariot of fire. 
It is thus that people will ask John if he is Elijah.  This messenger of the
coming of the Lord fits the figure of John the Baptist who challenges people to
turn their lives around (metanoia) and return to GOD so that they will be ready
for the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist prays for knowledge and wisdom so that GOD’s
will may be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>done.  This could easily be a prayer of John the Baptist. 
He sought guidance in his mission of proclaiming the coming day of the Lord –
Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even from the moment of John the Baptist’s birth, people
recognized that the newborn infant would have a special role in GOD’s plan. 
The way his birth had been foretold by the angel, his father’s being struck
speechless until the day of John’s circumcision, the birth to an elderly couple,
the name of John (“GOD is gracious”) being given, the visit by Mary – all these
are special signs that John was to play an important part in the history of
salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus, it is fitting
that we focus on the role of his relative who was born just six months before
Him.  As John matures and begins to follow the path that would lead him to his
adult ministry, John sees himself as a herald who announces the coming of the
Messiah.  John not only proclaims that the Christ is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>near by, already in the midst of the people, but he also
tells the people how they can prepare themselves to meet the Anointed One (the
Christ) of GOD.  They must examine their lives, turn away from sinfulness, and
turn their hearts to GOD.  John is austere in his preaching.  Many were
frightened by his demeanor and his message.  Yet, many also followed his
warnings, examined their lives, and worked on bettering their lives in
preparation for the Lord Jesus’ coming.  (See Luke 3: 1-16)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we complete our Advent journey (tomorrow being the end of
Advent), we too should examine our lives. Are we at a better place in our
relationship with the Lord Jesus and His Abba-Father than we were last year at
this time; than we were at the beginning of Advent (three weeks ago)?
Hopefully, we have acknowledged our sinfulness and sought the Lord Jesus’
forgiveness.  With a renewed spirit, maybe we have taken more time this Advent
to draw closer to the Lord Jesus.  With a greater sense of awareness of what
the birth of the Lord Jesus means to each of us individually and as members of
a faith community, we can begin to celebrate that GOD, in the person of Jesus,
has taken on our human flesh and we have One Who has walked our path and been
the Way </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>for us to be fuller members of His divine family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If not, it is never too late.  We can make GOoD use of these
last two days to draw into the real mystery (Greek:  mysterion, Latin: 
sacramentum meaning “sign”) of GOD becoming human for us – for you and for me.
Hopefully, we may make GOoD use of the opportunity to focus more on the true
meaning of Christmas this year. It is not just for partying with lots of
people, but rejoicing in the Presence of GOD-made-human and the presence we
share with our closest loved ones.  We can make this Christmas be a true
celebration of the Lord Jesus’ presence in our lives, not just for Christmas
day, but for every day during the Christmas season, and the coming new calendar
year of 2024, and the rest of our lives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How have I prepared
for the celebration of the Coming of the Lord Jesus in our midst?  In what ways
have I grown spiritually during Advent? What have I learned are the further
aspects of my life which need to be worked on, so that I can better prepare the
way of the Lord Jesus to me and to others? How have I helped others focus on
the true meaning of the season we are about ready to celebrate – the
Incarnation of the Lord Jesus Christ – true GOD and true human?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD of all patience.  Through Your
GOoDness, You continue to give us opportunities to reflect on Your love and
draw closer to You.  You have allowed Your Love to become one with us in the
flesh so that we could participate in Your mystery.  You have sent Your Son to
be the sacrament – the sign – the mystery – of Your compassionate love for us. 
You have enfleshed Your essence in the person of Jesus and allowed us to come
to know and be known by Him.  We have often focused on the wrong aspects of the
feast we are about to celebrate.  We have looked more toward the gift-giving
and gift-receiving than to the Gift Who is Your Son.  Help us to take the time
in the next few days to focus on the meaning of Your Son’s becoming human.  May
we lift up hymns and carols of praise to You for what You allowed and caused to
take place in the stable in Bethlehem.  It is in the name of the Lord Jesus,
Your Son and Sharer in Your divinity, and our Brother, Who is one with us in
humanity, that we make this prayer and we lift up our thanksgiving.  He is the
One Who has been born, preached, suffered, and died for us and Who is risen,
and is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within thirty-six hours the Church gives us five different
sets of readings with five different sets of prayers for the proper of the
Mass.  They all have different messages for us, centering on the Incarnation of
GOD in the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ.  Historically, the liturgies may
have come from different times, each with a slightly different emphasis.  I
will try to touch on at least one reading (usually the Gospel) from each of
them, before focusing on the last set of readings:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first set of readings (morning of December 24) is still
part of the Advent readings.  We hear the promise that GOD will build a house
for David from David’s own descendants, rather than David building a house for
GOD.  The household of David will be the source of the Messiah.  In the Gospel,
once Zechariah’s voice has been restored during the circumcision and the naming
of his son, John (the Baptist), Zechariah praises GOD for raising an offspring
of David to rule over GOD’s people in fulfillment of the promises of old. 
Zechariah also realizes the special role his own son will play in the
fulfillment of messianic prophecies, since John will go before the Lord Jesus
to prepare straight paths (direct access).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Vigil Liturgy or Mass on Christmas Eve focuses on the
joyful announcing of the Reign of GOD.  The prophet Isaiah speaks to the people
of Jerusalem about the restoration of the right relationship between GOD and
the people.  In the readings from the Acts of the Apostles, St. Paul reminds
the Jewish people of Pisidia (in central modern Turkey) that GOD has fulfilled the
promises made to David by raising up the savior, whose Advent was announced by
John the Baptist.  In the Gospel we hear the genealogy of Jesus starting with
Abraham.  We also hear about the angel of GOD appearing to Joseph in a dream
telling him to take Mary into his care because the Child Whom Mary carries in
her womb will be the Savior of the world and He will be the Promised One Who is
Emmanuel - GOD-with-us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Mass at Midnight, our First Reading speaks about a Son</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>given to us Who brings light to those in darkness, joy to
those in sorrow.  This Child will be given the Reign of GOD and be called by
the titles Wonder-Counselor, GOD-Hero, Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.  (This
passage is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the source of some of the words of a song in Handel’s
Messiah.)  The Reign that this Son will establish will be marked with justice
and peace.  St. Paul, in his letter to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Titus, reminds us that Jesus is the revelation of GOD’s
grace to all people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The glory of GOD has come in and through the Savior of the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel for Mass at Midnight is the traditional infancy
narrative from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Luke.  We hear the reason Mary and Joseph end up in
Bethlehem – because of their obedience to the Roman census.  The familiar image
of the baby </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a feeding trough in a
stable is presented to us, along with the announcement to the shepherds of the
birth of the Messiah.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings for the Mass at dawn begin with Isaiah telling
the people to rejoice for the Savior comes.  St. Paul, again writing to Titus,
reminds us that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we have been saved because the (c)hesed – kindness/love – of
GOD has allowed the Savior to be born.  The Gospel for this liturgy continues
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>infancy account according to Luke.  The shepherds go to see
the baby in the manger and believe.  Mary reflects on the events that have
happened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The scripture passages for the Mass during the Day are
probably the collection of readings from the oldest liturgy for the celebration
of the birth of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus.  These readings begin with rejoicing at the announcement
of the GOoD News of GOD’s Reign being established.  The Letter to the Hebrews
relates</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the fact that GOD has spoken more clearly than ever before,
through GOD’s own Son, the GOD-man Jesus.  The Son is the perfect reflection of
the Abba-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Father’s glory.  The Gospel is the prologue to St. John’s
Gospel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before I reflect on prologue to St. John’s Gospel, I would
like to share a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>few interesting items that can be gleaned from the earlier
gospel accounts. Historians have verified the census by the Roman government. 
(Check on this link   http://www.biblehistory.net/Chap2.htm.)  The time of the
census</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>would have been around 8 BC when it was decreed, and a
couple of years later by the time it was implemented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, Mary and Joseph would have been required to be in
Bethlehem around the year 6 BC.  Many people do not realize that the monk who
put together the Gregorian calendar (which is the basis of our modern calendar)
had been in error, with the error being about six-to-eight years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many scholars have also made points as to the passage of the
shepherds keeping watch over the flocks by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>night.  Most agree that it was unusual, but not impossible,
for them to be doing this in winter.  Many writers seem to think that Jesus was
born in fall or spring (rather than in winter) when shepherds often had the
flocks in the field at night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to turn our attention to the beautiful prologue</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>to St. John’s Gospel.  St. John is known for his
“theologizing” about the life of Jesus.  The introduction to his Gospel is a
beautiful example of this.  John begins:  “In the beginning</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>was the Word.”   John uses the word Logos (Λογος), a Greek</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>word which means “word” but much more.  He is familiar with
the Hebrew scriptures use of Debar YHWH, “The Word of the LORD.”  In the Hebrew
scriptures, “The Word of the LORD” was GOD’s own creative action.  When GOD
spoke, creation happened.  When GOD spoke the divine Word, prophets proclaimed
GOD’s message.  “The Word of the LORD” is more than symbols on a page or sounds
in the ear.   “The Word of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the LORD” is something active.  It is part of Who GOD is. 
It is</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>also the basis of the “Wisdom” of GOD that is spoken
throughout the Hebrew scriptures.  John thus says this active part of GOD has
been present from the beginning [at the time of Genesis (“the beginning”)].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John goes on:  “the Word was with GOD.”  The Logos was
present with GOD since the time before creation.  The Logos is separate from
GOD (the Abba-Father), but with GOD.  “And the Word was divine.” In this phrase
John says that the Logos, although separate from GOD (the Abba) had a full
share in the divinity, that is, the Word is GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Word was with GOD in the beginning, and through the
Word all things came into being, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>apart from the Word, nothing came to be.”  This phrase
speaks of the creative nature of “The Word of the LORD.”  Without the Logos
(Word), nothing has life or existence.  When GOD speaks the Word, life happens.
It is the creative “Word of the LORD” which/Who gives life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Whatever came to be in [the Word], found life, life for the
light of mortals.”   “The Word of the LORD”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gives life, and life is symbolized by light, as opposed to
the darkness of pre-creation chaos and darkness of evil.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness does not
overcome it.”  John uses the images of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>light and darkness throughout his writings.  The Light (Φος
- Phos) is GOoD, whereas darkness is evil.  The Light has more power than the
darkness.  The Light shines and darkness is gone.  The darkness cannot
overcome, or overtake, the Light.  Evil will lose out to the Word, at least in
the end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John the Apostle and Evangelist then inserts a comment about
John the Baptist and his role in pointing out the Light of the world:  “There
came a man named John, sent by GOD.  He came as a witness to bear testimony
about the Light, so that through the Light, all might come to belief.   John
only testified to the Light, for John was not the Light.”  John the Baptist was
the herald (precursor) to the Light.  He came before the Light to point to the
Light.  He bore witness to the Light.  Thus John was a martyr for the Light. 
[The Greek word, martyros (ìáñôõñïò), meaning “witness,” is the source of our
English word “martyr.”]  He gave his life (the ultimate witness) so that the
Light would shine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The real Light which [Who] gives Light to everyone was
coming into the world. The Light was in the world, and through the Light the
world was made, yet the world did not know who He was.”  John equates the
“Word” to the “Light.”  The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word of GOD enlightens the world, yet the world did not
recognize the Word/Light.  It</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is interesting that we use the image of light to show
understanding and wisdom or knowledge.  It is when we accept  “The Word of the
LORD” that we can “see” the Light. When we fail to accept “The Word of the
LORD” we are in darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“To His own, He came, yet His own did not accept Him. 
Anyone who did accept</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Him, He empowered to become children of GOD.”  John seems to
be saying that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Word of the LORD” – the Light of the World – came to
the Hebrew people, but some of them were not</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>able, or chose to refuse, to hear the Word or see the
Light.  Yet anyone (Jew or Gentile) who did/does accept the Word/Light
became/becomes GOD’s children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“These are they who believe in His name – who were begotten
not by blood, nor by carnal desire, nor by human willing it, but by</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD.”  Believers in the Word/Light become children of GOD
not because of their ancestors or national origins.  It is GOD’s gift for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>believers to become children of GOD.  The act of believing
the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word/Light is what empowers them to become children of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us, and
we have seen His glory:  the glory of an only Son coming from the Abba, filled
with enduring love.”   This is truly the Incarnation – the Word becoming
flesh.   “The Word of the LORD” is not only active and creative.   “The Word of
the LORD” has taken on human flesh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only has “The Word of the LORD” become</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>human, “The Word of the LORD” has “pitched His</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tent in our midst” ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμν (eskēnōsenen hçmin) – a
phrase which speaks of a sharing of life fully with us.  For just as a person
who pitches a tent among nomadic people shares in the life of the people, so
now, the “Word of the LORD,” has shared life with us fully by being human like
us – in all</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>things but sin (cf. Hebrews 4: 15).  And the purpose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of His incarnation and dwelling among us is to give us a
glimpse of the glory of GOD His Abba, a glory which speaks of GOD’s unending
love for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“John testified concerning Him by proclaiming, ‘This is the
One of whom I spoke, ‘The One coming</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>after me Who ranks ahead of me, for He was before me.’” 
Again we see John the Baptist preparing the way for the Adventus (Coming) of
the Savior.  Once the Savior/Word/Light appears, John fades into the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>background.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Of His fullness we have all had a share – love following
upon love.”  The gift of “The Word of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>LORD” becoming flesh is something we (believers) have
experienced.  It is love (agape), and more love, and more love.  The more we
are open to the Word made flesh, the more love we experience and share with
others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“For while the law was a gift through Moses, this enduring
love came through Jesus Christ.  No one </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has ever seen GOD.  It is GOD the only Son, ever at the Abba’s
side, who has revealed Him.”  Moses brought the people a sign of GOD’s care in
the giving of the law.  Jesus, however, brings a better gift – the gift of
GOD’s own being – the gift of GOD’s never ending and unconditional love
(agape).  We could not fully understand GOD’s love until Love took flesh and
pitched His tent among us and revealed that GOD is love and we have a share in
that love, if we believe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  As I celebrate
Christmas, how do I bring my appreciation of the Incarnation of Word/Light/Life
(Logos/Phos/Zoe) to others?  Am I giving (and receiving) gifts in the name of
the Lord Jesus?  Can people experience the Love (Agape) and Light (Phos) of
Jesus as I exchange presents and greet people on this holy day and during this
holy season? How can I extend a greeting for Blessed Holy-days beyond Christmas
and into the whole year?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD and Heavenly Abba-Father.  Through
Your GOoDness, You together with The Word (Logos), Your Son, have created the
world.  We owe our existence to You.  Yet life (Zoe) was not the greatest of
Your gifts.  You wanted us to experience Your love.  You allowed Your enduring
Love (Agape), Your Word (Logos), Your Son, to take on human flesh and live with
us, so that we might come into the Light (Phos)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of Your Love (Agape).  You invite us to accept Your Word
(Logos) – Your Life (Zoe) – Your Light (Phos)–</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your Love (Agape) that has been enfleshed in the person of
Jesus.  This is the greatest gift You share with us. As we celebrate the
Incarnation of Your Word (Logos), the human birth of Your Son, may we reflect
Him (Who is Light (Phos) to the world.  We ask that we may be reflectors of the
Light (Phos), signs of Your Love (Agape), givers of Your Life (Zoe), speakers
of Your Word (Logos), to those with whom we come in contact.  For our sharing
of Your gifts with others is our gift to You.  We thank You and praise You in
and through Your Son, The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word (Logos) made flesh, the Light (Phos) of the World, the
Incarnate Love (Agape), living and reigning in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>unity of the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, forever and
ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Second Day of Christmas!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hope and pray that your day yesterday was filled with joy,
peace, and love as you celebrated the birth of our Lord, Jesus Christ!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we continue the celebration of Christmas.  Christmas
is such a big feast in the Church that it cannot be limited to a single day. 
Throughout these days after Christmas, the Church continues to pray
“Celebrating the most sacred night (day) on which blessed Mary the immaculate
Virgin brought forth the Savior for this world, ” (Eucharistic Prayer I).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we also celebrate the feast of St. Stephen.  It may
seem strange to celebrate</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Stephen on this second day of Christmas, especially as
we hear the readings dealing with suffering and death that come to a follower
and witness (μαρτυρος – martyros) of Jesus.  I have a special place in my heart
as I reflect on Stephen.  It flows partly from my work in Stephen Ministry. 
Let me summarize the story of St. Stephen with a reflection on his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the time of the early Church, the Apostles are busy about
the ministry of the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word, that is, they are proclaiming the GOoD News (Gospel)
of Jesus the Christ in their preaching.  There is such a large number of
converts to Christianity (known as “The Way”), that some of the people’s needs
are not being met.  This is particularly true of some of the converts who are
Greek speaking, and especially the Greek- speaking widows.  The Apostles
realize their major ministry is the proclamation of the Word through their
preaching and teaching.  After prayer, they appoint seven</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>individuals as diakonoi (διακονοι), a Greek word meaning
“those who minister or serve.”  The title “deacon”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>comes from this same Greek work (Acts 6:1-7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the diakonoi is Stephen, “a man full of faith and the
Holy Spirit” (Acts 6: 5).  Stephen serves and ministers to the needs of
people.  Obviously, he not only proclaims the GOoD News by his acts of service
and deeds of ministry, but he also speaks words that proclaim the Gospel of
Jesus Christ.  In the First Reading for today, we hear that he works “great
wonders and signs among the people.”  So much so that “certain members of the
so-called ‘Synagogue of Roman Freedman’” challenge Stephen.  [There are a few
thoughts about who the ‘Synagogue of Roman Freedman’ were.  Some say that they
were “persons (who) were slaves of the Romans who had been freed, became
proselytes of the Jewish religion, and had a synagogue in Jerusalem.” Other
scripture scholars say that they were ‘a Greek-speaking synagogue of the first
century Hellenized Diaspora Jews.”]  They engage Stephen in debate, “but they
prove no match for the wisdom and spirit” with which Stephen speaks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>True to what Jesus says in today’s Gospel, Stephen is hauled
into court and is brought to trial before the religious leaders.  And also true
to the Gospel message of today, Stephen does not worry about what he will say
or how he will speak.  For when the hour of his trial arrives, Stephen is given
what to say (although it is not in today’s First Reading; see  Acts 6: 11–7:
53).  He realizes, as Jesus says in today’s Gospel, that he is not the speaker,
but the Spirit of the Jesus’ Abba-Father is speaking in and through him. 
Stephen gives witness (marturizo) to Jesus the Christ and how He is the
fulfillment of the Hebrew Scriptures from the time of Abraham to Moses and
beyond.  Stephen chastises the leaders of the Jews and blames them for acting
like their ancestors of old who persecuted the prophets (“spokespersons” for
GOD).  Stephen points out to them that they did not listen to Jesus, but
instead put Jesus to death.  Obviously, Stephen’s words upset the religious
leaders.  As we hear in the First Reading, Stephen then has a vision of the
Lord Jesus standing at GOD’s right hand.  The Jewish leaders immediately drag
him outside the city and stone him. [The north-eastern Gate of the Old City of
Jerusalem today is also called Stephen’s Gate for this reason.]  As he is being
stoned, he prays:  “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”  As a link to Stephen’s
prayer, today’s psalm is Psalm 31 in which we hear the verse “Into your hands I
commend my </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>spirit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen ultimately gives witness to the Lord Jesus, not just
by his serving as a diakonos (“servant,” “minister”) to the needs of people;
but also, he is the first martyr (martyros is the Greek</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>word for “witness”) who testifies (“gives witness”) to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the person of Jesus by giving of his life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflected on the person of Stephen and the readings and
the continued celebration of Christmas, I realized that the message of the
Incarnation and birth of Jesus is not just a story of a Baby being born in a
stable.  It is the GOoD News of GOD’s love for us, that ultimately is shown by
Jesus’ death and resurrection.  And this is the GOoD News we are called to
proclaim, first, like Stephen, by being diakonoi – people who minister and
serve the needs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of others.  And then, if necessary, we are called to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>proclaim and give witness (marturizo) to the Word by speech,
and ultimately even by our death.  These</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>may not be the most pleasant thoughts on this second day of
Christmas, but that is fully the message of the Child born to a virgin – GOD
loves us enough to share our humanity, and GOD wants us to share in the divine
life and serve one another, and to give witness to the GOoD News of GOD’s love,
even to the point of death.  Jesus is born to share our humanity; we must die
to ultimately share in the divine life.  Our lives are meant to be witnesses
(martyroi) and servants (diakonoi) to the GOoD News of Jesus Christ, beginning
with His birth and ending with His death and resurrection and His ultimate
coming in glory at the end of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How is the Lord
Jesus calling me to be a diakonos – servant/minister? In what ways can I
proclaim the GOoD News by my acts of assisting others? How have I given witness
(martyrizo) to the GOoD news? As I continue the celebration of Christmas and
spend time with family and friends, how can I proclaim the reason for the
season – GOD’s Love becoming incarnate for our salvation?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, our loving Abba-Father.  Through
Your GOoDness, You have given us the gift of Your Son, Jesus.  He was born in
the flesh to announce Your Love for us.  He gave His life as sign of Love. You
have called individuals from that time on, to proclaim Your message of Love through
serving and witnessing.  Give us the strength to serve and give witness to the
people whom You have placed in our lives – our family, friends, co-workers, and
chance acquaintances.  Thank You for the example of St. Stephen, who was a
servant and a witness.  As always, we want to give You all the praise and
glory, together with Your Son Jesus, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, for You
are our one and only Triune GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>P.S.  The feast of St. Stephen has been celebrated the day after
Christmas for centuries.  In a popular song during the Christmas time, Good
King Wenceslaus, we hear that the Good King “looked out, on the Feast of
Stephen.”  Wenceslaus lived in the tenth century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Third Day of Christmas!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today is the Feast of St. John, Apostle and Evangelist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The First Reading today is taken from the beginning of the
First Letter of John.  John, as an eyewitness of ministerial life of Jesus,
wants to share with his readers, and with us, what he has experienced, seen,
and heard. He says that Jesus is Life.  In the Gospel of John this message also</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>appears, especially in the Prologue to the Gospel (John 1:
25) and John 14:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6.  The Life of GOD has become visible, that is incarnate,
in the person of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Jesus.  We are invited to share in that Life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalm is a hymn of praise to GOD for GOD’s giving the
Light that dawns for the just.  I was reminded of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that on a December morning as I saw the beautiful sunrise. 
Light is a symbol of GOD’s presence.  The darkness of night was overpowered by
the dawn, just as Jesus, the Incarnate Light, overcame the darkness of sin and
death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Gospel for today focuses on John’s belief that Jesus is
risen from the dead-on Easter Sunday morning.  It is an interesting account. 
The two apostles hear from Mary Magdalen that the tomb is empty.  They race out
to the tomb.  John, presumably the younger of the two, arrives first, looks in,
but waits for Peter to arrive before going in.  I have always thought that this
was John’s way of showing respect for Peter as the head apostle.  John enters
the tomb after Peter and sees the wrappings.  Once John sees the wrapping (the
shroud), he believes.  He remembers Jesus’ words that He would rise again. He
recalls that Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life (John 14: 6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have often wondered why we celebrate the feast of John the
Apostle and Evangelist during the Christmas season.  It may be because his
First Letter is used during the Christmas season to speak about the mystery of
the Word made flesh, Love Incarnate, the Light overcoming the darkness.  It may
be because he is the only Apostle who died a natural death, although his
enemies reportedly tried to boil him in oil some time before he died.  It may
be because he is linked in his Gospel to “the beloved of the Lord.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is important is John’s faith and love.  When he was
called by Jesus, he immediately left his fishing career and followed Jesus. 
He, along with his brother James and Peter, were able to see some of the
miracles that none of the other apostles saw.  He is the one who was next to
Jesus at the Last Supper.  He was the last of the evangelists to write a
Gospel.  (Whether it was John himself or one of his disciples who actually took
the pen in hand is not the important point).  His writings show a lot of
insight and are the result of his pondering and reflecting on the life of
Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what does that say to me today? I am called, as John
was, to experience the presence of Jesus.  Like the meaning of name John, “GOD
is gracious,” I am called, as John was, to proclaim that GOD is gracious.  As I
see, hear, and experience the Lord Jesus working in my life and the lives of
others, I am called to reflect on those experiences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I, too, am an apostle, “one who is sent.”   I am sent to
announce to others what I have experienced.  I am called to be an evangelist,
too.  An evangelist</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is literally the “GOoD News Person.”  Thus, I am called to
be a “GOoD News Person,” someone who proclaims the GOoD News of what Jesus has
done for me and for others.  I, too, am a beloved of the Lord Jesus.  This is
the calling of all Christians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through our baptism we share in the role of “beloved of the
Lord,” “apostle,” and “evangelist.”  We are called to constantly proclaim that
“GOD</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is gracious.”  This is our baptismal vocation.  We may never
write a Gospel or a book of Revelation, but we are called to be witnesses to
the Life of the World, the Light that shines in the darkness.  We do this by
living lives that proclaim the GOoD News that GOD-is-with-us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  Do I consider
myself called to be an “apostle” – one who sent to others to share the Gospel?
In what ways have I been an “evangelist” – one who announces the GOoD News of
Jesus?  Have people been able to experience that I am one of the “beloved” of
the Lord Jesus by the way I witness to others and invite them into a closer
relationship with our GOD?  Do I proclaim by my lifestyle that “GOD is
gracious”?   What more can I do to live out my baptismal call to be an apostle,
an evangelist, and a beloved of the Lord Jesus?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Abba-Father of the Lord Jesus,
Who is the Incarnate Word of GOD, Life and Light of the World, Immanuel
(GOD-with-us).  Through Your GOoDness, You have sent Your Son into our world as
the Light that overcomes the darkness.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit,
give us the wisdom and understanding so we may experience Your presence in our
everyday lives.  Give us the strength to be sent out (“apostled”) to share Your
message with others.  May our lives proclaim that we are “GOoD News People” –
evangelists – and may we always model the message that You, O LORD GOD, are
gracious.  We thank You and praise You and Your Son in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, for together You live and reign as our one and only GOD, forever and
ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Seventh Day of Christmas!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we focus on the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and
Joseph, and through that focusing, we reflect on the qualities that should mark
all families.  The Genesis reading portrays the faith of Abraham.  His trusting
GOD allowed him to become the father of many nations.  The reading from Sirach
is an exposé on Fourth Commandment:  “Honor your father and your mother.”  The
psalms parallel one of Old Testament readings: Psalm 105 praises GOD for
fulfilling the promises to Abraham about his many descendants; Psalm 128
praises family life and shows the blessings in store for those who care for
their families while trusting GOD.  The reading from the Letter to the Hebrews
carries on the focus of Abraham’s family being blessed by the faith of their
ancestor.  The reading from St. Paul’s letter to the Colossians presents
attributes that should mark the members of a family and their relationship to
one another.  The Gospel passage gives us an insight into the family values of
Mary and Joseph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abraham (as seen in the Genesis, Psalm 105, and Hebrews
readings) was a family man and a man of faith. GOD promises Abraham a large
family, with as many descendants as there are stars in the sky.  Yet, Abraham’s
faith is challenged.  When he is 90, he has no direct offspring.  Soon after,
the slave Hagar gives birth to Ishmael, Abraham’s son, but not by Sarah.  Yet
Abraham wants a son with his wife, Sarah.  When he is nearly 100, he still does
not have a child by his wife Sarah.  GOD remains true to the promise by
allowing his 90-year-old wife to conceive and have a son, whom they name Isaac
(“laughter”).  Isaac is truly the joy of his aged parents.  Yet GOD is not done
testing Abraham’s faith, especially in regard to his descendants in and through
Isaac.  GOD asks Abraham to take Isaac and sacrifice Isaac.  Abraham realizes
that he must trust GOD even if it means losing the child through whom the
promise of a large, innumerable family would be fulfilled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reading from Sirach expands the understanding of the
Fourth Commandment dealing with respect for parents.  Honoring one’s parents
means obedience and a lot more.  It demands a positive and loving relationship
with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one’s parents, being willing to take care of them in the
waning years of their lives.  Psalm 128 shows that love for GOD will lead to a
blessed family</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. Paul’s letter to the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Colossians shows that respect in the family is not limited
to the children’s caring and obeying their parents.  Family love must be
evident in the love of husband and wife for each other, and parents for their
children, and children</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>respecting their parents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Love for GOD leading to a blessed family life can be seen in
the Gospel reading and the glimpse of the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and
Joseph.  Mary and Joseph (as we heard in the readings during Advent, and
especially in the last few days during the Octave of Christmas) were obedient
to GOD’s request.  They were faith-filled individuals (true to their heritage
as children of Abraham). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD blessed them as a result of their willingness to do
GOD’s will.  Yet, that blessing did not mean a</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>worry-free, easy life.  They had to deal with the issue of
Mary’s pregnancy other than from Joseph, traveling a great distance at the time
when Mary was to give birth, forecasts that people would be at odds because of
Mary’s child, and their having to leave their homeland and journey to Egypt to
avoid Herod’s murderous acts toward the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One Advent, a book club to which I belong, focused on the
Holy Family of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus and we realized that they did not always
have a care-free life.  Their life was blessed not only with joyful experiences,
but with challenges.  Blessings are not always equated with a trouble-free,
anxiety-free, happy-go-lucky, financially independent lifestyle, even within
the family.  Blessings flow from the loving and caring relationships between
different family members as they deal with each other and work together for the
GOoD of the whole family and the GOoD of those outside the family.  Blessings
are the result of having to make tough decisions in the most loving and caring
way possible.  It is not easy to be a part of a truly blessed and holy family. 
It requires work, respect, dedication, and love for each other.  Yet if the
family members can respect each other and seek to do what is best for the other
members of the family, the family will be blessed – it will be holy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today we think about family life and family values.  It is a
GOoD time to reflect on them as we gather with our loved ones during this holy
season of the year.  We are given the example of faith-filled families
(Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac; Jesus, Mary, and Joseph).  We are also reminded
that families are called to be reflections of GOD Who is a family of
Abba-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  What we celebrate and call to mind today is
the importance of relationships.  We are called to work on the relationships we
have with the other members of our immediate family, the human family, and the
family to which we belong because our Brother Jesus has invited us to be a part
of the family of GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:  How can the life of
the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, strengthen me in my relationships
with members of my family? Do I see that being “holy” and “blessed” does not
necessarily mean that I don’t have problems and challenges in my living out my
relationships within my family or community?  What is my reaction when I think
of my family and its interrelations as being called to reflect the
relationships within the GODhead?  What positive action will I do today and in
the days ahead to bolster the relationships within my family/community?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Parent, obedient Son,
Spirit of unity.  In Your very essence, You are essentially a family.  The love
that You share within Yourself is so powerful it has overflown into the
creation of the world, and more importantly the creation of humankind.  Through
Your GOoDness and love, You have formed man and woman in Your divine image,
person who are to be in relationships with others, as You are within the
GODhead.  You have gifted humanity with Your divine “creative power” by
allowing them to come together in a union that produces new life.  You have
called parents to reflect Your loving care and selfless desire to help others
in their role as nurturers and providers for their family.  Through Your Son,
Jesus, and Mary and Joseph, You have given all of us an example of what
honoring and loving a parent is all about.  We thank You for the gift of
allowing us to be part of a family.  May we demonstrate our faith in You by
honoring and caring for each member of the families in which You have placed
us.  We make this prayer in the name of Your Son, Jesus, obedient to You in all
things, our Brother and Savior, Who has welcomed us into Your divine family and
Who is living and reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Fifth Day of Christmas!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings reminds us of the importance of keeping the law
of GOD as a sign of having a relationship with GOD.  The First Readings
describes the importance of the law of love.  The Responsorial is an
exhortation to praise GOD for all the wondrous things GOD has done.  The Gospel
describes how Mary and Joseph fulfill the law after the birth of Jesus and how
Simeon recognizes the importance of the Infant being carried by His mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The section of the First Letter of John that we read today
shows that the author is aware that some people mistakenly believed that
knowledge (Greek gnosis) was the hallmark of a believer.  John, the writer of
this letter, insists that there is something greater than knowledge, and he
charges that the knowledge of GOD should lead to obedience to GOD’s commandment
of loving others.  Love is the light which shines in the darkness.  It is more
enlightening than mere knowledge. Those who only “know” without putting love
into practice are still in the dark.  When knowledge leads to love, then we are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>in a relationship with Light Who has come into the world and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>has taken flesh in order to cast out darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist urges joyful celebration of the mighty deeds of
GOD. One cannot keep quiet as one experiences the wondrous acts of GOD (with
the Incarnation and salvific ministry of Jesus being the greatest). One must
enthusiastically cry out in joyful song proclaiming what GOD has done, is
doing, and will continue to do for those who accept GOD’s message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mary and Joseph fulfill the Mosaic law by bring the 40-day
old</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Infant to the Temple in Jerusalem (about six miles from</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bethlehem).  They are obedient to the commandments of GOD.
They offer a sacrifice that demonstrates their lowly means – a pair of turtle
doves or young pigeons.  While in the Temple, they encounter Simeon, a
prophetic individual who has been told that he will experience the Anointed One
(the Messiah, the Christ) of GOD.  When Simeon sees the Infant Jesus, he
realizes that Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the One Who will bring salvation to the faithful people. 
Simeon voices the Nunc Dimittis prayer, “Now, Lord, You can dismiss Your
servant. . .”   This prayer is part of the Night Prayer of the Church.  Simeon
prophesies that Jesus will be the source of both edification (lifting up) and
the source of destruction of people in Israel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the readings today, I see two interwoven</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>themes being presented.  One is obedience, the other that of
light and love.  I realize that knowledge of GOD is not enough.  Merely knowing
Who GOD is or Who Jesus is, cannot lead to salvation.  Yes, knowing GOD is </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>important, but it must be linked to doing GOD’s will, that
is, to obedience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sense the frustration that the author of the First Reading
has as he meets individuals who believe that knowledge (gnosis) is enough. 
These gnostics (“know-it-alls”) focus so much on head knowledge that they keep
secret the “truths” they discover.  They do not want to share their knowledge
with others.  They are an elitist group who think their knowledge makes them
better than the rest of people.  They have the opinion that they have the light
while everyone else is in the dark.  It is against these individuals and their
philosophy that the First Reading is written.  True knowledge of Who GOD is,
and what GOD has done, should lead to proclamation of the Truth and sharing of
the Light, in obedience to GOD’s command.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Truth of Christmas (the Incarnation of GOD) is that GOD
wants to reveal the Truth to all people.  Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>was born for the salvation of all, not just for the
intellectuals who think they know it all.  All people can share in the life of
the Lord Jesus by living out the GOoD News which Jesus’ birth, ministry, death,
and resurrection have made possible.  The living out of the GOoD News is done
by proclaiming the message of GOD’s marvelous deeds in loving acts toward other
individuals.  Love is the mark of Jesus’ ministry, especially in the Johannine</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>writings (the Gospel of John, the three letters of John, the
Book of Revelation).  GOD so loves the world that the Son of GOD takes on flesh
and enters the world in order to save the world.  Acceptance of that GOoD News
means obedience to the Lord Jesus’ command of sharing that GOoD News with as
many as possible.  The most dramatic way of sharing the GOoD News is by our
loving others and enlightening them with the Light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a result of today’s readings, I am challenged to be more
loving of, and caring for, others, more enlightening of others.  I must let
them experience the joy, warmth, light of the Incarnate Son of GOD by the way I
treat them.  I must be a reflection of the Light in the darkness of their
days.  As I continue to sing GOD’s praise, my actions must make people aware of
the awesomeness of the love of GOD.  I cannot keep this to myself and think
that I, alone, have been given the knowledge of GOD.  It must be shared in the
Light so that all will be enlightened with joy, happiness, and love that comes
from GOD.  It is in doing so that I will be obedient to GOD and the commands
that are issued in today’s psalm:  “Announce the LORD’s salvation, day after
day.  Tell GOD’s glory among the nations; among all peoples, GOD’s wondrous
deeds.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:     In what ways of
thinking have I been enlightened by the Lord Jesus? What do I do with my
increasing “knowledge” of the ways of GOD? Can other people experience the
Light by the way I share the knowledge I have and through my actions of loving
care?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, ever joyful and loving.  Through
Your GOoDness, You desire that all come to an acceptance of Your gift of
salvation given to us through the death and resurrection of Your Incarnate Son.
You desire us to not only believe this GOoD News but to share it with others. 
We have sometimes been elitist in our understanding of the knowledge we have
received.  We have not wanted to share the Truth we have received. For our
failure to be obedient to Your command of proclaiming the Truth as Light for
others, we seek Your pardon and peace.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit,
inflame in our hearts the sense of joy and desire for sharing the GOoD News of
salvation with others by our loving them as You and Your Son have loved us.  We
make this prayer in the name of Jesus, the Word Incarnate, Your Son, our GOD
with skin on, Who has pitched His tent among us and brought us into the Truth
and Light of a closer relationship with You.  To You be all glory and honor and
praise, in and through Your Son, Who is living and reigning with You and the
Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and ever.  Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Readings:    1 John 2: 12-17;              Psalm 96: 7-8a,

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Sixth Day of Christmas!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The value system of believers is, or at least should be,
markedly different from those who only seek earthly pleasures.  St. John
continues his First Letter by informing his readers that they should keep their
eyes focused on the ways of GOD and not be enticed by merely worldly values. 
The psalm invites us to join in the praise of GOD since that is the only thing
that ultimately counts.  The Gospel presents the account of Anna, the
prophetess who senses the specialness of the newborn Child Who is brought into
the temple on the day of required ritual of presentation and purification of
His mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>St. John address three different age groups of people: 
children,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>parents, and young adults.  The message is similar:  because
of their belief in GOD and the relationship based on that belief, they are not
like others who do not have a belief in GOD.  Having a relationship with GOD
entitles the believers to acknowledge the forgiveness of their sins and to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>call GOD Abba – “Father – Daddy – Loving and Personal
Parent.”  It also demands a different attitude to the worldly ways that focus
on pleasure merely for the sake of pleasure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist urges the people to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>turn to GOD in a relationship of praise and thanksgiving. 
Acknowledging Who GOD is enables the believer to have a relationship with GOD. 
The</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>response should be a joyful lifting up of one’s heart, mind,
and soul to GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, Anna, the prophetess</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>who has spent the majority of her life in the temple
precincts, perceives the holiness and specialness of the Baby brought to the
temple by two poor parents.  Being in relationship with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>GOD allows her to know the uniqueness</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>of the Infant.  She turns to GOD in a prayer of praise and
also points out the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Baby to all who are nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A theme of relationship with GOD and how it changes a person
is what strikes me in the readings today.  When one continues to deepen a
relationship with GOD, then one is able to “see” things in a new light. Anna,
an elder Jewish woman, has been in the Temple day after day for</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>many years.  She is a woman of faith, a woman who has a
close relationship with GOD.  Because of this special bond with GOD, she is
able to sense that the Little One, Who is brought by Mary and Joseph, is
blessed by GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had long ago given up worldly ways.  She has been a
widow most of her</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life.  She spends her time in the House of GOD.  When she
looks at the Infant, she sees not the outward appearance of a Jewish Baby, but
she is able to look beyond His appearance and see the holiness that radiates
from the Baby.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The words from the Evangelist/Apostle John also challenge
me.  They speak about how things change as one develops an ever-closer bond
with GOD.  Relationship with GOD is true religion – (re [again] + ligio
[bond]).  When </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>we bond with GOD, we are able to see reality as it truly
is.  So much of our world is pretense, show, and falseness.  It is only when we
are again, and again (re) bonded (ligio), with GOD that we perceive what is
authentic.  We will know that salus (wholeness, holiness, healing, salvation)
that is ours because Jesus has died for the forgiveness of our sins.  We will
also then be able to acknowledge the true Parent (Abba, Life-Giver, Provider,
Lover of us), Who is GOD.  Our human parents are only a reflection [sacramentum
(Latin), mysterion (Greek), sign (English)] of the greater parenting that is
done by our GOD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Being loved by GOD leads us to have a different relationship
with others and with the world in which we live.  We are not as interested in
amassing wealth, gaining fame, and having prestige.  We desire to help others
and work for their true “GOoD.”  As we grow in our bond with GOD, we will spend
more time praising and thanking GOD for what GOD has done for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we continue our celebration of Christmas, we are invited
to see beyond the Infant in swaddling clothes.  We will not just see the Baby
in the manger, but also, we will see the Savior Who was born for our salus.  We
will know the GOoD News that He came to bring us.  We will experience the
forgiveness that His death and resurrection provide for us.  We draw further
into the bond with GOD Whom the Son of Mary called not only His Abba-Father,
but Whom Jesus allows us to call our Abba (“Loving and Personal Parent”).  We
will realize that we have a new and more powerful bond with our GOD, because
Mary gave birth to One Who is truly Immanuel (GOD-with-us), Yeshua
(GOD-saves).  We will be bonded with others and join with them in giving thanks
and praise to our GOD, our common Abba!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   How is my
relationship with GOD right now?  Do I constantly seek to be “re-bonded” to the
Lord Jesus and His Abba?  What merely earthly attractions draw me away from my
relationship with Jesus and the Abba?  What can I do to deepen my relationship
with Jesus and help others improve their relationship to Him and the Abba?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, Abba, intimate and loving
parent.  Through Your GOoDness, You have invited us into a relationship with
You, in and through Your Son, Jesus.  He has been born as a human so we might
be re- bonded to You as our Creator, our forgiving Provider.  We have become
Your daughters and sons because Jesus, Your Son, was born like us.  We have
often allowed ourselves to be deceived by the false promises of merely earthly
pleasures – of lust, power, hunger, fame, wealth.  We seek the healing that is
possible because of Your Son, the Son of Mary.  By the power of Your Holy
Spirit, open our eyes to see beyond the Baby born of Mary, to the saving acts performed
by Your Son as He ministered, healed, suffered, died, and rose from the dead. 
We lift up our voices in praise and thanksgiving for Your sending Your Son to
be our Redeemer, our Master-Teacher, our Brother.  It is in His name we make
this prayer, for He is One with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD,
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Merry Seventh Day of Christmas!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The readings remind us that because Jesus, the Eternal Word
of GOD, became flesh, we have been given life, truth, and an intimate
relationship with GOD.  Two of our readings are from the Johannine tradition,
those writings attributed to the Apostle/Evangelist St. John.  In the First
Reading, St. John reminds us that in the world there are false prophets and
individuals who are saying they are the Messiah-Christ, the one and only leader
of all.  We have the ability to recognize their lies because we have been given
the Truth in Jesus, Who is the Truth (John 14: 6).  The psalm urges the lifting
up of voices in praise of GOD.  The Gospel is the prologue to St. John’s
Gospel.  In it, we hear the account of the Incarnation in symbolic, but at the
same time, real language of John.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the First Reading, St. John wants his readers to be aware
of the fact that individuals have come, and will continue to come, in guises of
being the Anointed One of GOD.  These persons will claim that they are the true
messengers of GOD, but because they are not inline with Word of GOD enfleshed
in Jesus, they are</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>anti-christs.  The title “anti-christs” means two things:
people who pretend to be the Messiah (the Christ); and people who are acting
against (“anti”) Christ and His mission and ministry.  John instructs his followers
that true believers in Jesus will be able to recognize the anti-christs because
true followers have the Truth (Jesus) within them.  Those who are in
relationship with the Truth cannot be deceived as long as they remain “bonded
again” (re-ligio) to Jesus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The psalmist invites believers to sing GOD’s praises and be
united with all creation in proclaiming the magnificent deeds of the LORD. 
This is all the more important because the LORD has come to establish the
divine reign over all who call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Gospel, St. John uses symbolic (“sacramental” -
“signs of a deeper and more true reality”) words to describe the incarnation of
Jesus.  Jesus is the Word (Logos) which/Who has been with GOD (the Abba-Father)
from the very beginning. The Logos is one with the Abba since the Logos is
Divine, but the Logos is also distinct from GOD the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abba.  The Logos has given life and light to all creation. 
Nothing has come into existence without the Logos-Word of GOD.  Yet, the
Logos-Word has not always been accepted by people, even the chosen people of
GOD.  Those who accept the Word are empowered to be children of GOD, not
because of their blood lineage, not because of their desiring to be related to
GOD, but because GOD has gifted them with a new, life-giving relationship. 
This has come about because the Logos-Word has put on skin and pitched a tent
among us.  GOD has come to dwell with us in an intimate way, sharing our</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>life with us so we could share in the divine life of GOD,
and we could be called children of GOD.  We are able to have a different
relationship with GOD because the Word has been enfleshed in Jesus.  We can
call GOD our Abba, for we have become children of GOD in and through Jesus, the
Divine Logos-Word – GOD the Son – with skin on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am always overwhelmed as I reflect on the Johannine
writings.  St. John has a beautiful understanding of what a relationship with
GOD is all about.  John also realizes that the fullness of that relationship
cannot be expressed with mere human words.  It can only be “sacramentalized,”
that is, symbolized with analogous terms and symbols.  The Truth of the
relationship can only be glimpsed or slightly experienced in our human, earthly
life.  The fullness of what it all means is there, but not fully understood
until we are one with GOD eternally. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I reflect on the imagery of the Word of GOD, I recall
that in Hebrew “Word of GOD” [Debar YHWH] is something more than symbolic
letters written in a book or sounds proclaimed.  The Debar YHWH is creative,
active, and alive.  The fact that the Debar YHWH is wrapped with human skin and
made visible to us in the person of Jesus</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is an awesome concept.  The Debar YHWH truly is Light and
Life.  As Light, the Logos- Word casts out the darkness (evil) and the darkness
cannot overcome the Light.  Although darkness will try to deceive and confuse
people and defuse the Light, it cannot overcome the Light.  The Light is Truth
and empowers those who accept the Word-Light-Life-Truth to have a new
relationship with GOD. We are truly made part of GOD’s family – GOD’s daughters
and sons – not in some false or pretend way.  We are truly made heirs to GOD’s
Reign.  We are not children of GOD by our birth (as Jesus is one in essence
[consubstantial] with GOD [His Abba] or as the Hebrew nation was made GOD’s
chosen</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ones by their being from one of the tribes of Israel).  We
are adopted into GOD’s family because Jesus, the Word-made- flesh, has come
among us and dwelled with us  ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμν [eskçnôsen en hçmin] literally
“pitched His tent with us”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pitching of a tent among nomadic people was a sign of
sharing life fully with those among whom their tent was pitched.  It meant a
shared existence, a shared destiny.  It was not something taken for granted. 
It marked a covenant relationship.  What happened to anyone in the camp,
happened to all.  By the Logos-Word [Jesus] pitching a tent among us, the Word
Incarnate shares fully our human nature and wants to share with us the divine
nature so we can be one with the Logos-Word and with His Abba – our Abba – in
union with the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could go on pondering the meaning of this passage, but
suffice it to say, I am once again humbled and motivated.  I am</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>humbled by the great love GOD has for me and for all who are
invited to accept the Logos-Word [Jesus]. GOD invites all of us.  GOD really
and truly desires to share divine existence with us.  GOD wants us to be in
relationship with Divine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also am motivated to proclaim this to others so that they,
too, will accept the Word and be welcomed into the family of GOD.  It is then
that we can join the psalmist and say/sing: “Sing to the LORD a new song; sing
to the LORD, all you lands. Sing to the LORD; bless GOD’s name; announce the
salvation of the LORD, day after day.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is a GOoD time to be reflective of what has been
happening in 2025, realizing what GOD has done in our lives. Reflecting on the
Word reminds us of the Love GOD has for us, in spite of (or during) the
illnesses, natural disasters, civil unrest.  As we end this calendar year of
2025, we can look back on life, our individual lives and our collective lives
as members of a family and of a community. GOD has come to us and the Word has
pitched His tent among us.  If we look carefully, we will see GOD’s action in
our lives.  It doesn’t mean that GOD caused the negative events that happened,
but that GOD was present with us during those difficult times.  GOD has given
us hope and the strength to persevere in the midst of tragedy.  And the Lord
Jesus invites us to praise and thank GOD for the GOoD times we experienced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The personal question/action for today:   Have I been
faithful to the Truth which is the Word made flesh and Who has pitched His tent
among us?  Have I grown in “knowledge” through my relationship with the Truth,
the Abba, and the Holy Spirit?  As I look back at the events of 2025, do I see
GOD’s action in my life and the lives of those around me? From whom have I
benefitted by their sharing their witness to the Truth?  How have I given
witness to the Truth in my life?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blessed are You, LORD GOD, loving Abba-Father. Your
Logos-Word is co-eternal with You.  We could not fully understand Your Word, so
You allowed Your Word to not only be creative and bring humans to life and be
the Light shining in the darkness.  Through Your GOoDness, You also sent Your
Logos-Word among us to be Your Word with skin on.  The Word has not only taken
on flesh, but also has pitched His tent among us, sharing with us every aspect
of our life (except sin), so that we could share in Your Divine Life as Your
adopted sons and daughters.  We thank You and praise You for Your Divine Plan,
that has allowed Your Word to enlighten our darkness.  We ask Your pardon and
forgiveness for the times we have chosen to remain in the dark rather than walk
in the Light.  Through the power of Your Holy Spirit, enlighten our eyes so
that we can see the deception and false promises of darkness and search out the
Way of Light.  We lift up our voices in praise of You and Your Word-in-flesh,
Jesus.  We make this prayer in His name, for He is Your Son, our Brother and
Lord, the Light, the Truth, the Life, the Way to You, and He is living and
reigning with You and the Holy Spirit, our one and only GOD, for ever and
ever.  Amen.</p>
